item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements business combinations when we make an acquisition of another company  we use the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas 
under sfas for acquisitions subsequent to june  and accounting principles board apb opinion for acquisitions prior to june   we record as our cost the estimated fair value of the acquired assets less liabilities assumed 
any difference between the cost of an acquired company and the sum of the fair values of tangible and intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
the reported income of an acquired company includes the operations of the acquired company from the date of acquisition 
income recognition from home and land sales income from home and land sales is recorded when title is conveyed to the home or land buyer  adequate cash payment has been received and there is no continued involvement 
income recognition from mortgage loans profits and losses relating to the sale of mortgage loans are recognized when legal control passes to the buyer of the mortgage and the sales price is collected 
interest income recognition for mortgage loans receivable and recognition of related deferred fees and costs interest income is recognized as earned for each mortgage loan during the period from the loan closing date to the sale date when legal contract passes to the buyer and the sale price is collected 
all fees related to the origination of mortgage loans and direct loan origination costs are deferred and recorded as either a an adjustment to the related mortgage loans upon the closing of a loan or b recognized as a deferred asset or deferred revenue while the loan is in process 
these fees and costs include loan origination fees  loan discount  and salaries and wages 
such deferred fees and costs relating to the closed loans are recognized over the life of the loans as an adjustment of yield or taken into operations under sale of the loan to a permanent investor 
inventories inventories and long lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less selling costs 
fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
construction costs are accumulated during the period of construction and charged to cost of sales under specific identification methods 
land  land development  and common facility costs are allocated based on buildable acres to product types within each community  then charged to cost of sales equally based upon the number of homes to be constructed in each product type 
for inventories of communities under development  a loss is recorded when events and circumstances indicate impairment and the undiscounted future cash flows generated are less than the related carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is based on discounted future cash flows generated from expected revenue  cost to complete including interest  and selling costs 
insurance deductible reserves our deductible is  per occurrence for worker s compensation and general liability insurance 
reserves have been established based upon actuarial analysis of estimated future losses during and for fiscal  our deductible increases to million per occurrence for general liability insurance and  per occurrence for worker s compensation insurance 
interest costs related to properties under development are capitalized during the land development and home construction period and expensed as cost of sales interest as the related inventories are sold 
costs related to properties not under development are charged to interest expense separately in the consolidated statements of income 
land options costs are capitalized when incurred and either included as part of the purchase price when the land is acquired or charged to operations when we determine we will not exercise the option 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

the effects of lessee involvement in asset construction eitf  we record on the consolidated balance sheets specific performance options  options with variable interest entities  and other options under consolidated inventory not owned with the offset to liabilities from inventory not owned  minority interest from inventory not owned and minority interest from consolidated joint ventures 
intangible assets the intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet are goodwill  tradenames  architectural designs  distribution processes  and contractual agreements with both definite and indefinite lives resulting from company acquisitions 
we no longer amortize goodwill or indefinite life intangibles  but instead assess them periodically for impairment 
we performed such assessments utilizing a fair value approach as of october  and  and determined that no impairment of intangibles existed 
we are amortizing the definite life intangibles over their expected useful life  ranging from three to seven years 
in may  we made a decision to change our fiscal california acquisition brand name to k 
hovnanian homes 
this resulted in a reclassification of million from goodwill and indefinite life intangibles to definite life intangibles less amortization reported on our october  consolidated balance sheet 
we are amortizing the definite life intangible as the homes in the communities still using the old california acquisition brand name are delivered to customers and the revenue on the sale of these homes is recognized 
using this methodology  we expect this intangible to be substantially written off by our fourth quarter of post development completion costs in those instances where a development is substantially completed and sold and we have additional construction work to be incurred  an estimated liability is provided to cover the cost of such work and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
warranty costs based upon historical experience  we accrue warranty costs as part of cost of sales for essential repair costs over  to homes  community amenities and land development infrastructure 
in addition  we accrue for warranty costs under our  per occurrence general liability insurance deductible as part of selling  general and administrative costs 
capital resources and liquidity our operations consist primarily of residential housing development and sales in our northeast region new jersey  southern new york  pennsylvania  ohio  michigan  and minnesota  our southeast region washington dc  delaware  maryland  virginia  west virginia  north carolina  south carolina  and florida  our southwest region texas and arizona  and our west region california 
during the year ended october   we substantially liquidated our operations in the mid south from our fiscal acquisition of washington homes 
in addition  we provide financial services to our homebuilding customers 
our cash uses during the twelve months ended october  were for operating expenses  increases in housing inventories  construction  income taxes  interest  the payoff of our million term loan  the redemption of senior notes due  the repurchase of common stock  and the acquisition of a florida homebuilder 
we provided for our cash requirements from housing and land sales  the revolving credit facility  non recourse mortgage secured by operating property  the issuance of million senior notes  financial service revenues  and other revenues 
we believe that these sources of cash are sufficient to finance our working capital requirements and other needs 
cash requirements for fiscal are projected to increase as we continue to open new communities and fund organic growth 
we anticipate moderate usage under the existing revolving credit facility to replenish inventory associated with the construction of new homes 
on november   we issued million of senior notes due and million of senior subordinated notes due which generated proceeds of approximately million 
the purpose of these issuances was to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and for general corporate purposes 
our net income historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net income and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  interest and other accrued liabilities  accounts payable  inventory levels  mortgage loans and liabilities  and non cash charges relating to depreciation  the write off of computer software costs  amortization of definite life intangibles and impairment losses 
when we are expanding our operations  which was the case in fiscal and  inventory levels  receivables  prepaids and other assets increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
liabilities also increase as operations expand 
the increase in liabilities partially offsets the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels  receivables  prepaids and other assets 
similarly  as our mortgage operations expand  net income from these operations increase  but for cash flow purposes are offset by the net change in mortgage assets and liabilities 
on july   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
as of october   million shares have been purchased under this program  of which million and million shares were repurchased during the twelve months ended october  and  respectively 
in addition  in  we retired at no cost million shares that were held by a seller of a previous acquisition 
on march   our board of directors authorized a for stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
all share information reflects this stock dividend 
our homebuilding bank borrowings are made pursuant to an amended and restated unsecured revolving credit agreement the agreement that provides a revolving credit line and letter of credit line of million through july the facility contains an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased to billion subject to the availability of additional commitments 
interest is payable monthly at various rates of either the prime rate or a spread over libor ranging from to per annum  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement 
in addition  we pay a fee ranging from to per annum  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio and the weighted average unused portion of the revolving credit line 
at october   there was million drawn under this agreement and we had approximately million of homebuilding cash 
at october   we had issued million of letters of credit which reduces cash available under the agreement 
we believe that we will be able either to extend the agreement beyond july or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
we currently are in compliance and intend to maintain compliance with the covenants under the agreement 
each of our significant subsidiaries  except for our title insurance and home mortgage subsidiaries and joint ventures  is a guarantor under the agreement 
at october   we had million of outstanding senior debt million  net of discount  comprised of million senior notes due  million senior notes due  million senior notes due  and million senior notes due at october   we had outstanding million of senior subordinated debt comprised of million senior subordinated notes due  and million senior subordinated notes due on november   we issued million of senior notes due and million of senior subordinated notes due each of our wholly owned subsidiaries  except for k 
hovnanian enterprises  inc  the issuer of the senior and senior subordinated notes  our title insurance and home mortgage subsidiaries  and joint ventures  is a guarantor of the senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
on may   we redeemed our senior notes due  and we recorded million of expenses associated with the extinguishment of this debt 
on march   we paid off our million term loan  and we recorded million of expenses associated with the extinguishment of the debt 
in both cases  these expenses have been reported as expenses related to extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statements of income 
our mortgage banking subsidiary s warehousing agreement was amended on august  pursuant to the agreement  we may borrow up to million 
the agreement expires in july and interest is payable monthly at the eurodollar rate plus 
we believe that we will be able either to extend this agreement beyond july or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
as of october   the aggregate principal amount of all borrowings under this agreement was million 
total inventory increased million during the twelve months ended october  this increase excluded the change in consolidated inventory not owned of million consisting of specific performance options  options with variable interest entities  and other options that were added to our balance sheet in accordance with sfas  sfas  and eitf  and variable interest entities in accordance with fin see the recent accounting pronouncements section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional explanation of fin excluding the impact from acquisitions of million in our southeast region  total inventory in our northeast region increased million  the southeast region increased million  the southwest region increased million  and our west region increased million 
the increase in our existing regions was primarily the result of planned future organic growth 
substantially all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next twelve months 
most inventory completed or under development is financed through our line of credit  and senior subordinated indebtedness 
we usually option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we limit our financial exposure to the amounts invested in the option deposits and predevelopment costs 
this significantly reduces our risk and generally allows us to obtain necessary development approvals before acquisition of the land

the following table summarizes our started or completed unsold homes in active and substantially completed communities october  october  unsold homes models total unsold homes models total northeast region southeast region southwest region west region total     receivables  deposits and notes increased million to million at october  the increase was primarily due to the timing of cash received from homes that closed during the last days of october 
receivables from home revenues amounted to million and million at october  and  respectively 
prepaid expenses and other assets are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change prepaid project costs    investment in joint ventures    senior residential rental properties   other prepaids   other assets    total    prepaid project costs consist of community specific expenditures that are used over the life of the community 
such prepaids are expensed as homes are delivered 
the increase in prepaid project costs was primarily due to the opening of new communities in all our regions 
investments in joint ventures increased as we entered into several new joint ventures during the year ended october  other than completion guarantees  no other guarantees associated with unconsolidated joint ventures have been given 
also included in other prepaids and other assets are debt issuance fees  non qualified associate benefit plan assets  and miscellaneous prepaids and assets 
at october   we had million of goodwill 
this amount resulted from company acquisitions prior to fiscal in may  we made a decision to change our fiscal california acquisition brand name to k 
hovnanian homes 
this resulted in a reclassification of million from goodwill and indefinite life intangibles to definite life intangibles less amortization reported on our october  consolidated balance sheet 
we are amortizing the definite life intangible as the homes in the communities still using the old california acquisition brand name are delivered to customers and the revenue on the sale of these homes is recognized 
using this methodology  we expect this intangible to be substantially written off by our fourth quarter of definite life intangibles increased million to million at october  this increase was the result of our november  florida acquisition  net of amortization expense  as well as the reclassification of million related to the california acquisition brand name  net of amortization expense  as noted above 
to the extent the acquisition price was greater than the book value of tangible assets which were stepped up to fair values  purchase price premiums were classified as intangibles 
professionals are hired to appraise all acquired intangibles 
such appraisals resulted in all fiscal and acquisition premiums to be categorized as definite life intangibles 
see the critical accounting policies section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional explanation of intangibles 
for tax purposes all our intangibles  except those resulting from an acquisition classified as a tax free exchange  are being amortized over years 
mortgage loans held for sale consist of residential mortgages receivable of which million and million at october  and october   respectively  are being temporarily warehoused and awaiting sale in the secondary mortgage market 
the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale was due to the improvement in the turnaround of mortgages sold 
we may incur risk with respect to mortgages that become delinquent  but only to the extent the losses are not covered by mortgage insurance or resale value of the house 
historically  we have incurred minimal credit losses 
accounts payable and other liabilities are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change accounts payable    reserves    accrued expenses   accrued compensation    property secured by a mortgage   other liabilities    total    the increase in accounts payable and other liabilities was primarily due to increases in accounts payable  reserves  accrued compensation  property secured by a mortgage  and other liabilities 
the increase in accounts payable was due to our november florida acquisition as well as the opening of new communities in our existing markets 
our reserves increased in accordance with our general liability and workman s compensation policies 
the increase in accrued compensation was related to bonuses due to achieving higher profits 
property secured by a mortgage increased due to the consolidation of a property in our northeast region that was secured by a mortgage and subsequently replaced by a letter of credit and an increase in other liabilities was due to a cash advance we received related to a structured lot option

october  includes deliveries from our california acquisition beginning on january  other includes operations from markets we have exited in recent years 
the increase in housing revenues during the year ended october  was primarily due to organic growth within our existing operations 
excluding acquisitions  housing revenues and average sales prices increased in all four of our regions combined by and  respectively 
homes delivered  excluding acquisitions  increased   and in our northeast region  southeast region  and southwest region  respectively

between our october  contract backlog and november net contracts  we have sold approximately of our projected deliveries for fiscal cost of sales includes expenses for housing and land and lot sales

as a result  depending on the mix of both the communities and of home types delivered  consolidated gross margin will fluctuate up or down 
during  we decided to add an additional line item to the income statement to show previously capitalized interest amortized through cost of sales 
the consolidated gross margins  before interest expense remained flat at during the year ended october  compared to the same period last year  despite the fact that we believe gross margins were adversely impacted in due to the effect of price increases in lumber  concrete  and certain other building materials 
in addition  gross margins were negatively impacted by our and acquisitions which have lower margins than our historical consolidated average margins  yet still achieve strong returns on investment due to higher than average inventory turns 
during the year ended october   our consolidated gross margin  before interest expense  increased from the previous year 
this increase was primarily the result of increased sales prices 
also shown in the table are our results of gross margins  after interest expense 
after deducting interest expense  which was previously capitalized and amortized through cost of sales  our homebuilding gross margin was equal to the gross margin achieved in the prior fiscal year 
the dollar increases in gross margin  before interest expense for each of the three years ended october    and were attributed to increased sales  resulting from both organic growth in deliveries and our acquisitions of other homebuilders 
homebuilding selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues have averaged approximately for the years ended october    and such expenses increased to million for the year ended october   and increased to million for the year ended october  from million for the previous year 
the increased spending year over year was primarily due to our acquisition deliveries and increased deliveries in previously existing markets 
we have written off or written down certain inventories totaling   and million during the years ended october    and  respectively  to their estimated fair value 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional explanation 
these write offs and write downs were incurred primarily because of the decision not to exercise certain options to purchase land  redesign of communities in planning  a change in the marketing strategy to liquidate a particular property or lower property values 
during the years ended october    and  we wrote off residential land options and approval and engineering costs amounting to   and million  respectively  which are included in the total write offs mentioned above 
when a community is redesigned  abandoned engineering costs are written off 
option and approval and engineering costs are written off when a community s proforma profitability does not produce adequate returns on the investment commensurate with the risk and we cancel the option 
such write offs were located in all our regions 
during the year ended october   we wrote down a community million in our northeast region  million in our southeast region  and million in our southwest region 
the write down in the northeast region was attributed to a section of a community that was built in accordance with a low income housing clause 
in preparation for selling this property  an outside appraisal was prepared resulting in a reduction in inventory carrying amount to fair value 
the write downs in our southeast region and southwest region were attributed to property that was acquired as part of our acquisition in these regions 
a decision was made to liquidate these two properties resulting in lower sales prices 
we wrote down one community million in our southwest region during the year ended october  this property was acquired as part of one of our acquisitions 
a decision was made to liquidate this property resulting in lower sales prices 
the write downs of residential inventory during the year ended october  were attributed to poland and the mid south 
the write down in poland was based upon changes in market conditions 
in the mid south  land was written down based on a purchase offer 
we have made a decision to discontinue selling homes in these two markets and offer the remaining lots for sale 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in inventory carrying amounts to fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss 
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales 
a breakout of land and lot sales is set forth below year ended in thousands october  october  october  land and lot sales    cost of sales    land and lot sales gross margin   land and lot sales are incidental to our residential housing operations and are expected to continue in the future but may significantly fluctuate up or down 
financial services financial services consists primarily of originating mortgages from our homebuyers  selling such mortgages in the secondary market  and title insurance activities 
during the years ended october   october   and october   financial services provided a   and million pretax profit  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to increased activity in our mortgage operations  along with our homebuilding growth 
the increases in and were primarily due to reduced costs  increased mortgage loan amounts  and the addition of mortgage operations from our acquisitions 
in addition to our wholly owned mortgage subsidiaries  customers obtained mortgages from our mortgage joint ventures in our northeast region ohio and west region in and  and our west region in in the market areas served by our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries  approximately   and of our non cash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the years ended october    and  respectively 
servicing rights on new mortgages originated by us will be sold as the loans are closed 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses include the operations at our headquarters in red bank  new jersey 
such expenses include our executive offices  information services  human resources  corporate accounting  training  treasury  process redesign  internal audit  construction services  and administration of insurance  quality  and safety 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses were for the year ended october  and for the years ended october  and  respectively 
the decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses during the year ended october  compared to the same period last year was due to reduced depreciation expense as certain assets are now fully depreciated and reduced consulting services as certain non recurring projects were completed last year 
increases in corporate general and administrative dollar expenses comparing fiscal to  are primarily attributed to higher employee incentives due to higher returns on equity and an increase in the number of employees 
interest interest expense includes housing  and land and lot interest that is capitalized while the land and homes are developed and expensed with the sold land and homes  as well as other interest 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for detail on interest incurred  expensed  and capitalized 
interest related to homes sold as a percentage of home revenues amounted to   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
these percentage decreases are due to our average debt as a percentage of average inventory decreasing and lower interest rates 
these percentage decreases are primarily attributed to a decrease in debt leverage of our company due to growth in equity from earnings and lower interest rates 
other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous residential housing operations expenses  senior residential property operations  amortization of senior and senior subordinated note issuance expenses  earnout payments from homebuilding company acquisitions  amortization of the consultant s agreement and the right of first refusal agreement from our california acquisition in fiscal  minority interest relating to consolidated joint ventures  corporate owned life insurance  and certain contributions 
also reported in other operations are expenses associated with exiting our mid south market in fiscal  the write off of an asset of a previous acquisition  as well as the write off of costs associated with our enterprise wide operating software 
off balance sheet financing in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
at october   we had million options in cash and letters of credit to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of billion 
only million of the billion in land and lot option purchase contracts contained specific performance clauses which require us to purchase the land or lots upon satisfaction of certain requirements by both the sellers and the company 
additionally  our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the nonrefundable deposits  letters of credit and other nonrefundable amounts incurred 
we have no material third party guarantees 
pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  we consolidated million of inventory not owned at october   representing the fair value of the optioned property 
additionally  to reflect the fair value of the inventory consolidated under fin  we eliminated million of its related cash deposits for lot option contracts  which are included in consolidated inventory not owned 
because we are unable to get the selling entities to provide us with any financial information  the fair value of the optioned property less our cash deposits and liabilities from inventory not owned  was reported on the balance sheet as minority interest from inventory not owned totaling million 
at october   we had cash deposits and letters of credit totaling million  representing our current maximum exposure associated with the consolidation of lot option contracts 
creditors of these vie s  if any  have no recourse against us 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our aggregate contractual commitments at october  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt     capital lease obligations operating leases      purchase obligations   other long term liabilities total      represents our senior notes and other notes payable  and related interest payments 
interest on variable rate obligations is based on rates effective as of october  represents obligations under option contracts with specific performance provisions  net of cash deposits 
we had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of approximately million and million  respectively  at october  related principally to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments 
we do not believe that any such letters of credit or bonds are likely to be drawn upon 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
our disclosure of guarantees is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas 
the new standard provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the affect of the method used on reported results 
we have not elected to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in our second fiscal quarter ending april  our disclosure of accounting for stock based compensation is included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin a variable interest entity vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity from financing its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii equity holders either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if an entity is deemed to be a vie  pursuant to fin  an enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
fin was effective immediately for vie s created after january  pursuant to fasb revision to fin r fin r  issued in december  our company was not required to apply the provisions of fin to an interest held in a variable interest entity or potential variable interest entity until the end of our quarter ended april  for vie s created before february  in accordance with fin r  we have fully implemented fin as of april  based on the provisions of fin  we have concluded that whenever we option land or lots from an entity and pay a non refundable deposit  a vie is created under condition ii b and c of the previous paragraph 
we have been deemed to have provided subordinated financial support  which refers to variable interests that will absorb some or all of an entity s expected theoretical losses if they occur 
for each vie created with a significant nonrefundable option fee  we will compute expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined in fin if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie we will consolidate it on our balance sheet 
the fair value of the vie s inventory will be reported as consolidated inventory not owned variable interest entities 
management believes fin was not clearly thought out for application in the homebuilding industry for land and lot options 
under fin  we can have an option and put down a small deposit as a percentage of the purchase price and still have to consolidate the entity 
our exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with the vie is only the deposit  not it s total assets consolidated on the balance sheet 
in certain cases we will have to place inventory on our balance sheet the vie has optioned to other developers 
in addition  if the vie has creditors  it s debt will be placed on our balance sheet even though the creditors have no recourse against our company 
based on these observations we believe consolidating vie s based on land and lot option deposits does not reflect the economic realities or risks of owning and developing land 
at october   all vie s we were required to consolidate were as a result of our options to purchase land or lots from the selling entities 
we paid cash or issued letters of credit deposits to these thirty one vie s totaling million 
our option deposits represent our maximum exposure to loss 
the fair value of the property owned by the vie s was million 
because we could not get the remainder of the selling entities to provide us with any financial information  the fair value of the optioned property less our cash deposits and liabilities from inventory not owned  which totaled million  was reported on the balance sheet as minority interest from inventory not owned 
creditors of these vie s have no recourse against our company 
we will continue to secure land and lots using options 
including the deposits with the thirty one vie s above  at october  we have total cash and letters of credit deposits amounting to approximately million to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of billion 
not all our deposits are with vie s 
the maximum exposure to loss is limited to the deposits although some deposits are refundable at our request or refundable if certain conditions are not met

sfas amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities that fall within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas also amends certain other existing pronouncements  which will result in more consistent reporting of contracts that are derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that warrant separate accounting 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this statement establishes how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of sfas as a liability because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
for the company  sfas was effective the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company currently controls several finite life partnerships which are included in the consolidated accounts of the company 
the application of sfas as it relates to finite life entities has been deferred indefinitely and therefore the company has not applied sfas to the minority interest of these partnerships 
based on the estimated value of the assets owned by the partnerships at october   the company estimates that the minority interest in these partnerships would be entitled to receive approximately its current carrying value upon the dissolution of the partnership 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab 
existing accounting guidance requires an entity to record on its balance sheet the fair value of any issued and outstanding mortgage loan commitments 
sab requires that the fair value measurement include only differences between the guaranteed interest rate in the loan commitment and a market interest rate  excluding any future cash flows related to i expected fees to be received when the loan commitment becomes a loan  ii gains from selling the loan  or iii the servicing value created from the loan 
the guidance in sab must be applied to mortgage loan commitments that are accounted for as derivatives and are entered into after march  the adoption of the guidance in sab did not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which is a revision to sfas and supersedes apb and sfas this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
as of the required effective date  all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under statement will apply this statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under statement for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  those entities may elect to apply a modified version of the retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by statement as a result  beginning in our fiscal fourth quarter of  we will adopt sfas r and begin reflecting the stock option expense determined under fair value based methods in our income statement rather than as pro forma disclosure in the notes to the financial statements 
we expect the effect of adopting sfas r to be similar to the effect presented in our proforma disclosure related to sfas total taxes total taxes as a percentage of income before taxes amounted to approximately   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
the decrease in this percentage from to is primarily attributed to lower state taxes 
annually we make an adjustment to the previous year s estimated federal and state income taxes based on actual taxes per our filed income tax returns 
this year s net adjustment for state income taxes was made in the fourth quarter of and totaled million  slightly higher than we have experienced in the past 
this adjustment was primarily caused by lower than estimated state income taxes in california and new jersey 
california  a unitary tax state  allows alternative methods of allocating income between states 
for the accrual we used the standard allocation method but in preparing the actual return we discovered that an alternative allocation methodology resulted in lower income taxes 
in addition  fiscal was the first year for a major change in new jersey tax laws 
being the first year to estimate taxes under the new law  we felt that it would be prudent to conservatively estimate our state income taxes 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we filed our actual new jersey tax return for which yielded lower taxes than we accrued in fiscal deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income 
if for some reason the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years to recover the deferred tax assets 
as a result  management is confident such deferred tax assets reflected in the balance sheet are recoverable regardless of future income 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional explanation of taxes 
inflation inflation has a long term effect on us because increasing costs of land  materials  and labor result in increasing sale prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising house costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
in recent years  in the price ranges in which our homes sell  we have not found this risk to be a significant problem 
inflation has a lesser short term effect on us because we generally negotiate fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between four to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of our homebuilding cost of sales 
mergers and acquisitions on november  we acquired a florida homebuilder for cash and  shares of our class a common stock 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  with the results of operations of this entity included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition 
on november  and december   we acquired two texas homebuilding companies 
on april   we acquired a build on your own lot homebuilder in ohio  and on august   we acquired a homebuilder in arizona 
our aggregate net cash purchase price  including payment of third party debt  for fiscal year acquisitions was approximately million 
all fiscal and acquisitions provide for other payments to be made  generally dependant upon achievement of certain future operating and return objectives 
on january   we acquired a california homebuilder for a total purchase price of million  of which million was paid in cash and  shares of our class a common stock were issued 
at the date of acquisition we also paid off approximately million of their third party debt 
during the second quarter ended april   we exercised the right to retire at no cost  class a common stock shares that were held by the selling principal under the terms of the acquisition

certain risks  uncertainties  and other factors are described in detail in item and business and properties in this form k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk facing us is interest rate risk on our long term debt 
in connection with our mortgage operations  mortgage loans held for sale and the associated mortgage warehouse line of credit are subject to interest rate risk  however  such obligations reprice frequently and are short term in duration 
in addition  we hedge the interest rate risk on mortgage loans by obtaining forward commitments from private investors 
accordingly the risk from mortgage loans is not material 
we do not hedge interest rate risk other than on mortgage loans using financial instruments 
we are also subject to foreign currency risk but this risk is not material

libor plus 
in addition  we have reassessed the market risk for our variable rate debt  which is based upon the prime rate or a spread over libor  and we believe that a one percent increase in the prime rate or libor rate would have an approximate million increase in interest expense for the twelve months ended october   assuming million of variable rate debt outstanding from november  to october
