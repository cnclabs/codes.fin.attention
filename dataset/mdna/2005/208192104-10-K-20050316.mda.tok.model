item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements filed with this report 
overview business overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes innovative products for the dermatology market 
our products aim to improve the management of dermatological diseases and 
table of contents provide significant product differentiation 
we have branded our proprietary foam drug delivery vehicle  versafoam 
in our marketed products were olux  a super high potency topical steroid prescribed for the treatment of steroid responsive dermatological diseases  lux q  a mid potency topical steroid prescribed for scalp dermatoses such as psoriasis  eczema and seborrheic dermatitis  soriatane  an oral medicine for the treatment of severe psoriasis  and evoclin tm  a topical treatment for acne vulgaris 
we began selling soriatane in march after we acquired the us product rights from roche 
we launched evoclin commercially in december after we received product approval from the fda 
revenue from the new products contributed significantly to our revenue growth in in addition to the new products launched in  other projects in our research and development pipeline in included velac for the treatment of acne  desilux desonide versafoam ef   a low potency topical steroid formulated to treat atopic dermatitis  olux clobetasol propionate versafoam ef   a high potency topical steroid formulated to treat atopic dermatitis and plaque psoriasis  and other products in the preclinical development stage 
in november  the fda notified us that it would not approve our nda for extina  a topical anti fungal treatment for seborrheic dermatitis 
the fda s position was based on the conclusion that  although extina demonstrated non inferiority to the comparator drug currently on the market  it did not demonstrate statistically significant superiority to placebo foam 
we have continued discussions with the fda about what  if any  steps we can take to secure approval for extina 
we have the rights to a variety of pharmaceutical agents in various stages of preclinical and clinical development in multiple novel delivery technologies 
we sell product directly to wholesale distributors and to one national retail pharmacy chain 
consistent with pharmaceutical industry patterns  approximately of our product revenues in were derived from seven major customers 
to enable us to focus on our core sales and marketing activities  we selectively outsource certain non sales and non marketing functions  such as manufacturing  warehousing and distribution 
currently dpt and accrapac manufacture commercial supplies of olux  lux q and evoclin 
roche manufactures commercial supplies of soriatane 
sps handles all of our product distribution activities 
as we expand our activities in these areas  we expect to invest additional financial resources in managing those outsourced functions 
summary of results in we completed our first full year of operating profitability 
our total revenues increased by to million and we generated net income of million or per diluted share 
product revenues increased by to million in from million in the increase was due to the introduction of two new products  soriatane and evoclin  as well as growth from our two existing products  olux and lux q 
we significantly increased our direct and indirect promotional capabilities during this included hiring sales professionals  which more than doubled our sales force to professionals at the end of the year and positions connetics as a strong commercial force in the dermatology market 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in research and development expenses in decreased to million from million in primarily due to the completion of pivotal trials for velac  evoclin and extina in we generated cash from operations of million in  compared to using million of cash in operations in in addition to the cash provided by operations  our most significant changes in cash flow during were the use of million to acquire soriatane product rights and million of net proceeds from a private placement of common stock 
our working capital was million at the end of compared to million at the end of 
table of contents certain events in during  we filed nda s with the fda for our product candidates extina  a foam formulation of a concentration of the antifungal drug ketoconazole  for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis  and velac  a combination of clindamycin and tretinoin  for the treatment of acne 
we also commenced phase iii clinical trials for our product candidate  desilux  a low potency topical steroid  formulated with desonide in our proprietary emollient foam delivery vehicle 
in february  we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock in a private offering to certain accredited investors at a price of per share for net proceeds of million 
we used the proceeds from this offering to acquire the exclusive us rights to roche s soriatane  which we completed in march including the purchase price of million  assumed liabilities of million and transaction costs of  we recorded an intangible asset of approximately million related to the soriatane acquisition  which we are amortizing over an estimated useful life of years 
in july  we entered into a multi year consent with roche to sell soriatane to a us based distributor that exports branded pharmaceutical products to select international markets 
product sold to this distributor is not permitted to be resold in the us under the terms of the agreement  we will pay a royalty to roche on soriatane sales made during the term of the agreement to this distributor 
in march  we entered into an agreement with ucb pharma  a subsidiary of ucb group  pursuant to which we authorized ucb pharma to promote olux and lux q to a segment of us pcp s 
in september  in connection with ucb pharma s acquisition of celltech plc  ucb notified us that it intended to discontinue the co promotion agreement  effective march  ucb will continue to promote olux and lux q until then 
through the end of the promotion period  ucb s focus will be on approximately of pcp s who are active prescribers of dermatology products  including olux and lux q 
the purpose of the co promotion agreement is to ensure appropriate use of olux and lux q with the current pcp users and to build value for the olux and lux q brands 
we estimate that before we entered into the agreement with ucb pharma  pcp s wrote approximately of prescriptions for olux and lux q  even though we have promoted primarily to dermatologists 
we pay ucb a fee based on prescriptions written by targeted pcp s which is recorded as an expense in selling general and administrative expense 
ucb bears the marketing costs for promoting the products including product samples  marketing materials  etc we will not have any financial obligation to ucb on prescriptions generated by pcp s after march  in august  we submitted an nda for velac clindamycin and tretinoin with the fda and  in october  we received notification that the fda accepted the nda for filing as of august  for the three months ended september   we recorded a million fee due to the licensor upon the filing of the nda 
because the product has not been approved and has no alternative future use  we recorded the fee as an in process research and development and milestone expense 
under the terms of the license agreement we entered into in with yamanouchi europe bv  we hold exclusive rights to develop and commercialize velac in the us and canada and non exclusive rights in mexico 
in september  we licensed to pierre fabre dermatologie exclusive commercial rights to olux for europe  excluding italy and the uk where the product is licensed to mipharm spa the license agreement with pierre fabre also grants marketing rights for certain countries in south america and africa 
pierre fabre will market the product under different trade names 
under the terms of the license  we received an upfront license payment of  and we will receive milestone payments and royalties on product sales 
pierre fabre will be responsible for costs associated with product manufacturing  sales  marketing and distribution in its licensed territories 
as part of the agreement  we also negotiated a right of first refusal in the us to an early stage  innovative dermatology product currently under development by pierre fabre 
pierre fabre anticipates an initial launch of olux in select european markets in mid 
table of contents in october  we received approval from the fda for evoclin clindamycin foam  for the treatment of acne vulgaris 
evoclin is delivered in our proprietary versafoam vehicle 
in anticipation of the commercial launch of evoclin  we hired sales professionals in november and we announced the commercial launch of the product in december with the availability of g and g trade unit sizes 
in november  the fda notified us that it would not approve extina 
the fda s position was based on the conclusion that  although extina demonstrated non inferiority to the comparator drug currently on the market  it did not demonstrate statistically significant superiority to placebo foam 
we have continued discussions with the fda about what  if any  steps we can take to secure approval for extina 
in november we announced that medicis informed us that it has in licensed rights to an issued patent that it asserts will be infringed by our product candidate velac 
based on our prior review of the medicis licensed patent  we believe that velac will not infringe the patent assuming the patent is valid 
while we are not aware of any legal filings related to this assertion by the patent holder or medicis  we believe  based on information publicly available on the uspto website  that the inventor named on the patent has filed a reissue patent application with the uspto 
to our knowledge  the uspto has not formally announced the filing of the reissue application in the official gazette as of the date of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements  and therefore are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition reserves for discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks 
we recognize product revenue net of allowances for estimated discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks 
we allow a discount for prompt payment 
we estimate these allowances based primarily on our past experience 
we also consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  trends in distributor inventory  economic trends that might impact patient demand for our products including competitive environment  and other factors 
we accept from customers the return of pharmaceuticals that are within six months before their expiration date 
as a practice  we avoid shipping product that has less than ten months dating 
we authorize returns for damaged products and exchanges for expired products in accordance with our returned goods policy and procedures 
we monitor inventories in the distributor channel to help us assess the rate of return 
we establish and monitor reserves for rebates payable by us to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs 
generally  we pay managed care organizations and state medicaid programs a rebate on the prescriptions filled that are covered by the respective programs with us 
we determine the reserve 
table of contents amount at the time of the sale based on our best estimate of the expected prescription fill rate to managed care and state medicaid patients  adjusted to reflect historical experience and known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
in the past  actual discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks have not generally exceeded our reserves 
however  the rates and amount in future periods are inherently uncertain 
our revenue reserve rate was approximately of our gross product revenues for compared to in  reflecting the higher reserve requirements for soriatane 
if future rates and amounts are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our reported revenue  conversely  if actual returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported revenue 
if we changed our assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets impairment assessments we have in the past made acquisitions of products and businesses that include goodwill  license agreements  product rights  and other identifiable intangible assets 
we assess goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment  we have determined that there is only one reporting unit  specifically the sale of specialty pharmaceutical products for dermatological diseases 
we test goodwill for impairment in the annual impairment test on october using the two step process required by sfas first  we review the carrying amount of the reporting unit compared to the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of our common stock and on discounted cash flows based on analyses prepared by management 
an excess carrying value compared to fair value would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
second  if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  then we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
based on these estimates  we determined that as of october  there was no impairment of goodwill 
since october   there have been no indications of impairment and the next annual impairment test will occur as of october  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we evaluate purchased intangibles and other long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
we have not recorded any impairment charges for long lived intangible assets for the three years ended december  assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
accordingly  future changes in market capitalization or estimates used in discounted cash flows analyses could result in significantly different fair values of the reporting unit  which may result in impairment of goodwill 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we record valuation allowances against our 
table of contents deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
our income tax provision is determined using an annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of tax deductions and operating loss carryforwards available in the united states 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the fiscal year as we obtain new information that may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  utilization of tax credits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
in we experienced a full year of profitability 
in prior years  we recorded an income tax provision primarily based on the foreign operations of our subsidiary in australia  while experiencing losses for our us operations 
as a result  we have some remaining operating losses to carryforward and partially offset future domestic profits  if and when earned 
the deferred tax asset resulting from the operating loss carry forwards is offset by a valuation allowance until we meet certain specific tests regarding continued profitability 
our effective tax rate and the related income tax provision may increase significantly in the future after the operating loss carryforwards have been exhausted 
results of operations revenues we recognize product revenues net of allowances for estimated discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks 
years ended december  change change dollars in thousands product revenues olux lux q soriatane evoclin other total product revenues royalty and contract revenues royalty contract total royalty and contract revenues total revenues our product revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in product revenues reflects the introduction of two new products in  soriatane in march and evoclin in december  and  to a lesser extent  increases in sales volume and sales prices for existing products 
of the increase in revenues  is attributable to the introduction of the new products  to increases in the prices of existing products  and to increased sales volumes on existing products 
net product revenues increased to million in from million in increased sales volumes for olux and lux q in accounted for of this increase and increases in pricing accounted for the remaining of this increase 

table of contents during the first half of  we made a decision to bring in house the function of contract administration responsibility for the calculation and related reporting of all allowances and discounts for which managed care plans and medicaid programs are eligible 
previously we utilized third parties to perform the allowance calculation and related reporting 
in connection with this change we performed a comprehensive review of our calculation for medicaid product pricing allowances  which resulted in an adjustment to reserves recorded in prior periods 
as a result  we recorded a one time reduction of product revenues in the amount of  in the second quarter of we have determined that the effect of this change in estimate would not have had a material impact on our previously issued financial statements 
royalty and contract revenues decreased to million in from million in the million decrease was primarily due to the termination of the sc johnson royalty agreement related to a concentrated aerosol foam spray in the first quarter of royalties received from sc johnson totaled million in and million in  which included a one time royalty payment of million 
additionally  in we recognized  of relaxin related revenue associated with the execution of the agreement with bas medical  inc in july of the relaxin related revenue   represented previously deferred revenue associated with license agreements with other third parties that was fully recognized upon the execution of the bas medical agreement 
we did not receive any relaxin related revenue in and do not expect any in the future 
royalty and contract revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to royalties received in connection with the sc johnson license agreement in the amount of million in  compared to million in the recognition of  in relaxin related revenue in also contributed to the increase over these increases were partially offset by decreases in contract revenue from other third parties related to one time contract payments made in  including an initial fee of million received from pharmacia corporation now pfizer to license certain rights related to our foam drug delivery technology and  paid by novartis to exercise an option to expand their license 
we expect that product revenues will increase in  although at a slower rate than in  due to continued sales growth of all of our products and the effect of having a full year of revenue for soriatane  which we acquired in march  and evoclin  which we launched in december in  we anticipate that royalty and contract revenues will be flat to slightly down due to the absence of the royalties from sc johnson 
however  in and beyond  contract revenue may fluctuate depending on whether we enter into additional collaborations  when and whether we or our partners achieve milestones under existing agreements  and the timing of any new business opportunities that we may identify 
cost of product revenues our cost of product revenues includes the third party costs of manufacturing olux  lux q and evoclin  the cost of soriatane inventory acquired from roche  depreciation costs associated with connetics owned equipment located at the dpt facility in texas  allocation of overhead  royalty payments based on a percentage of our product revenues  product freight and distribution costs from sps and certain manufacturing support and quality assurance costs 
years ended december  as a as a as a of net of net of net product product product revenues revenues revenues dollars in thousands cost of product revenues our cost of product revenues increased to million in from million in the increase included million for increased product revenues  million due to increased royalty payments resulting primarily from royalties paid on soriatane sales to a us based distributor that exports 
table of contents branded pharmaceutical products to select international markets  and million as a result of the allocation of costs previously categorized as research and development 
before january   inventory and cost of goods sold only captured third party product manufacturing costs  depreciation on connetics owned equipment at our third party manufacturers  product freight and distribution costs from the third party that handles all of our product distribution activities and royalties 
effective january   we began including certain manufacturing support and quality assurance costs in the cost of finished goods inventory and samples inventory which had previously been classified as research and development expense 
those activities include overseeing third party manufacturing  process development  quality assurance and quality control activities 
we have determined that the effect of this change in accounting would not have had a material impact on our financial statements in any prior quarterly or annual period 
for the year ended december   we allocated million of costs which in previous years would have been included in research and development  or r d  expense as follows million to cost of goods sold  million to selling expense  million to the value of commercial inventory  and   to the value of samples inventory 
cost of product revenues increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in sales volume of our products  as well as the establishment of a  reserve recorded during related to minimum purchase commitments under an agreement with dpt 
if the effects of the  reserve are excluded  we experienced a slight improvement in our gross product margin due to the combined effects of the price increases for olux and lux q  effective in the fourth quarter and the second quarter  and slightly lower cost of manufacturing our products 
in  we expect the cost of product revenues as a percentage of revenue to trend marginally higher due to an increased proportion of sales coming from products with higher royalty rates 
amortization of intangible assets we amortize certain identifiable intangible assets  primarily product rights  over the estimated life of the asset 
years ended december  change change dollars in thousands amortization of intangible assets  nm in the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement to acquire exclusive us rights to soriatane which resulted in recording million in intangible assets 
we are amortizing the related intangible assets over an estimated useful life of ten years 
amortization expense in included months of amortization related to soriatane totaling million  which is the primary reason for the increase over in we will record a full year of amortization for the soriatane intangible assets totaling approximately million  resulting in an increase in amortization expense of million over research and development research and development expenses include costs of personnel to support our research and development activities  costs of preclinical studies  costs of conducting our clinical trials such as clinical 
table of contents investigator fees  monitoring costs  data management and drug supply costs  external research programs and an allocation of facilities costs 
years ended december  change change dollars in thousands research and development expenses as noted above under cost of product revenues  for the year ended december   we allocated million of costs  which in previous years would have been included in r d expense  to cost of goods sold  sales expense  and the values of commercial and samples of inventory 
r d expense for before the allocation was million or million less than in year to year changes in research and development expenses are primarily due to the timing of and sample sizes required for particular trials 
the increase in expenses in compared to and the subsequent decrease in are primarily due to the timing and completion of pivotal trials for extina  evoclin  and velac in  as noted in the preclinical and clinical research in the development of new dermatology products category in the table below 
the reduction in is also due to the allocation of research and development expenses as noted above  partially offset by  related to the write off of the extina finished goods inventory in late our research and development expenses  including the million allocated to other accounts in  primarily consisted of years ended december  category in millions preclinical and clinical research in the development of new dermatology products quality assurance and quality control in the maintenance and enhancement of existing dermatology products optimization of manufacturing and process development for existing dermatology products manufacturing  process development and optimization of dermatology products under development quality assurance and quality control in the development of new dermatology products basic research and formulation of new dermatology products regulatory review of new and existing dermatology products 
table of contents the following table sets forth the status of  and costs attributable to  our product candidates currently in clinical trials as well as other current research and development programs 
the actual timing of completion of phases of research could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
estimated completion accumulated program of phase iii related research and phase of clinical development expenses description indication development trials through velac  a gel formulation of clindamycin and tretinoin for the treatment of acne excluding license and milestone payments to yamanouchi nda filed completed million desilux tm desonide  versafoam ef   a low potency topical steroid formulated to treat atopic dermatitis phase iii late million olux clobetasol propionate versafoam ef   a high potency topical steroid formulated to treat atopic dermatitis and plaque psoriasis preclinical late million preclinical research and development for multiple dermatological indications preclinical n a million in general  we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly in due to additional research and clinical trials 
consistent with our development model  we have a minimum of four product candidates in product formulation  at least two in late stage clinical trials and we expect to launch one new product or indication commercially in pharmaceutical products that we develop internally can take several years to research  develop and bring to market in the us we cannot reliably estimate the overall completion dates or total costs to complete our major research and development programs 
the clinical development portion of these programs can span several years and any estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products 
the fda defines the steps required to develop a drug in the us clinical development typically involves three phases of study  and the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
if we fail to obtain  or experience any delay in obtaining  regulatory approval  it could materially adversely affect our business 
for additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see factors affecting our business and prospects we cannot sell our current products and product candidates if we do not obtain and maintain governmental approvals  we may spend a significant amount of money to obtain fda and other regulatory approvals  which may never be granted  the expenses associated with our clinical trials are significant 
we rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates  and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily  and our continued growth depends on our ability to develop new products  and if we are unable to develop new products  our expenses may exceed our revenues without any return on the investment 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with finance  legal  insurance  marketing  sales  and other administrative matters 
years ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased direct and indirect promotional capabilities million  increased marketing and sales activities such as advertising  tradeshows and conventions million  increased labor and benefit expenses  primarily due to increased headcount in the marketing  general and administrative departments million  increased expenses related to product sampling million  increased outside legal  audit and tax expenses million  and increased business insurance costs million 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased labor and benefit expenses due to increased headcount million  increased expenses related to product sampling and sales promotion programs million  increased cost of outside service and other fees primarily related to warehousing  distribution and production of sales and marketing materials increased business development activities  and increased outside legal expenses incurred 
those increases were partially offset by a  decrease in various marketing activities such as tradeshows  honorariums  and medical education 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in primarily because of increased promotional activities and a full year of expenses related to the increased headcount in the sales and other departments 
in process research and development and milestone payments in process research and development and milestone expense represents payments made in connection with an acquisition of a product or milestone payments related to product development 
we expense these costs when they are incurred as the product may not meet either technological feasibility or commercial 
table of contents success because the product remains in clinical development or alternative future use has not been established 
years ended december  change change dollars in thousands in process research and development and milestone payments  nm nm  in may  we entered into an agreement with yamanouchi europe bv to license velac 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid yamanouchi an initial million licensing fee  which we recorded as in process research and development expense in as the product remains in clinical development 
in  we initiated a phase iii trial for velac 
under the terms of the agreement  we recorded an additional million of in process research and development expense related to this milestone 
in august  we submitted a nda for velac with the fda and  in october  we received notification that the fda accepted the nda for filing as of august  as a result  we recorded an additional million milestone in the third quarter of due to the licensor upon the filing of the nda 
as noted above  because the product has not been approved  we recorded the fee as in process research and development and milestone payment expense 
interest and other income expense  net years ended december  change change dollars in thousands interest and other income expense  net interest income gain on sale of investment nm  interest expense   nm other income expense  net interest income 
interest income increased to million in from  in the increase in was due to interest earned on larger cash investment balances in connection with cash we received from million in net proceeds from a private placement of common stock in february and issuing million in convertible senior notes in may interest income increased to  in from  in the increase in was due to interest earned on larger cash and investment balances in connection with the cash we received from issuing million of convertible senior notes in may  partially offset by lower market interest rates on investments 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase reflects the fact that we incurred a full year of interest expense in on the convertible senior notes issued in may interest expense increased to million in from  in the increase in is a direct result of the interest expense associated with the convertible senior notes issued in may income taxes years ended december  change change dollars in thousands income tax provision 
table of contents prior to  we recorded an income tax provision primarily based on the foreign operations of our subsidiary in australia  while experiencing losses for our us operations 
as a result  we will use operating loss carryforwards to partially offset future domestic profits  if and when earned 
the deferred tax asset resulting from the operating loss carry forwards is offset by a valuation allowance until we meet certain specific tests regarding the continued profitability 
our income tax provision is determined using an annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of tax deductions and operating loss carryforwards available in the united states 
the income tax provision increased to million in from million in primarily due to an increase for us federal tax of  resulting mostly from the effect of the alternative minimum tax in  and  for various us states  partially offset by a reduction for foreign taxes of  the income tax provision increased to million in from  in the increase was primarily due to an increase for us federal tax of  resulting mostly from tax benefits taken in  and an increase for foreign tax of  the us tax benefit arose principally due to the job creation and worker assistance act of enacted on march   which allows taxpayers to carry back net operating losses generated in and to offset alternative minimum tax previously paid 
the amounts reported above for u 
s federal tax include us withholding taxes paid on foreign earnings and the foreign taxes are net of the foreign tax credit claimed in australia for the us withholding tax 
our effective tax rate and related tax provisions may increase significantly in the future after our net operating loss and other carryforwards have been exhausted 
for a more complete description of our income tax position  refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources december  change dollars in thousands cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities sources and uses of cash cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december   down from million at december  the decrease of million was primarily due to our acquisition of soriatane product rights  for which the cash used was million  partially offset by a our private placement of common stock with net proceeds of million and net cash provided by our operations of million 
other major sources and uses of cash included our net sales of marketable securities of million  primarily to finance our soriatane acquisition  partially offset by million used for increases in accounts receivable resulting from our increased sales 
working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  significant changes in working capital during in addition to the changes identified above for cash  marketable securities  and accounts receivable included increases in current assets of million for prepayments and other current assets and million for inventory and increases in liabilities of million for allowances for rebates  returns  and chargebacks and million for accounts payable 
the million increase for prepayments and other current assets and the million increase in inventory are primarily a result of growth in our business and related expenses 
we increased our allowance for rebates  returns  and chargebacks as a result of our increased net product revenues  primarily due to soriatane 
the million increase in accounts payable was related primarily to the increase in business activity 
we made capital expenditures of million in compared to  in and million in the expenditures in were primarily for leasehold improvements on our new corporate 
table of contents headquarters  which we occupied starting in february  and for manufacturing and laboratory equipment 
on february   we completed a private placement of million shares of our common stock to accredited institutional investors at a price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million 
on may   we issued million of convertible senior notes due may  in a private placement exempt from registration under the securities act of the notes are senior  unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with any of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt 
the notes are convertible into our shares of common stock at any time at the option of the note holder at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
this conversion price is higher than the price of our common stock on the date the notes were issued 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  which is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning november  offering expenses of million related to the issuance of these notes have been included in other assets and are amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the notes 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations and commitments payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total contractual cash obligations on may   we issued million of convertible senior notes due may  in a private offering 
the notes are unsecured and rank equal to all of our future unsecured and unsubordinated debts 
the notes are convertible at any time at the option of note holders into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares for each  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
the amounts reflected above include annual interest payments of approximately million per year  assuming that the notes are not redeemed or converted before maturity 
we lease laboratory and office facilities under non cancelable operating leases  which expire in april in june  we signed a series of new non cancelable facility lease agreements to lease approximately  square feet of space in palo alto  california that we moved into in february under our agreement with dpt  we are also obligated to pay approximately  per year in rent for the pro rata portion of dpt s facility allocated to the aerosol line 
under the dpt agreement  we will pay rent for the term of the agreement or as long as we own the associated assets  whichever is longer 
we also lease various automobiles and office equipment under similar leases  expiring through these obligations are to be partially offset by  to be received from subleasing arrangements with third parties 
in march we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with dpt that requires minimum purchase commitments  beginning six months after the opening of the commercial 
table of contents production line and continuing for years 
also in we entered into a license agreement that requires minimum royalty payments beginning in and continuing for fifteen years  unless the agreement is terminated earlier by either party 
in  we entered into a five year service agreement for prescription information that requires minimum fees 
per our manufacturing and supply agreements with our three suppliers  accrapac  dpt and roche  we may incur significant penalties related to cancellation of purchase orders  including paying an amount equal to the entire cancelled purchase order 
we had approximately million in outstanding open purchase orders to our suppliers at december  and the entire amount is included in the table in year we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from product sales and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through at least the next months 
we cannot be certain of the amount of our future product revenues  as product sales can be impacted by patent risks and competition from new products  and products under development may not be safe and effective or approved by the fda  or we may not be able to produce them in commercial quantities at reasonable costs  and the products may not gain satisfactory market acceptance 
the amount of capital we require for operations in the future depends on numerous factors  including the level of product revenues  the extent of commercialization activities  the scope and progress of our clinical research and development programs  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and competing technological and market developments 
if we need funds in the future to in license or acquire additional marketed or late stage development products  a portion of the funds may come from our existing cash  which will result in fewer resources available to our current products and clinical programs 
to take action on business development opportunities we may identify in the future  we may need to use some of our available cash  or raise additional cash by liquidating some of our investment portfolio and or raising additional funds through equity or debt financings 
we currently have no commitments for any additional financings 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development of our other products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in item of regulation s k that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
stock based payments include grants of employee stock options 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires companies to recognize all stock based payments to employees in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas r is effective for all interim or annual periods beginning after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in our third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 

table of contents under the retroactive options  we may restate prior periods either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that we record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our holdings of financial instruments comprise a mix of securities that may include us corporate debt  us government debt  municipal debt  and asset and mortgage backed securities 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
generally  we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to reductions in interest rates 
interest income from our investments is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
while a reduction in interest rates would decrease interest income  the negative effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of our marketable securities portfolio 
a hypothetical decrease of basis points in market fixed interest rates would increase the fair value of our portfolio by approximately  or one half of one percent 
an increase in interest rates of basis points would decrease the value of the portfolio by a similar amount 
due to the nature of our marketable securities  we have concluded that we face minimal material market risk exposure 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value assets available for sale securities weighted average annual interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate the table above includes principal and fair value amounts of million as of december   related to auction rate securities 
although these securities have long final maturities from years to perpetuity  we consider them to be short term investments because liquidity is provided through the short term to days interest rate reset mechanism 
these securities are allocated between maturity groupings based on their final maturities 
the table above also includes principal amounts of million and fair value amounts of million related to asset backed and mortgage backed securities that are allocated between maturity groupings based on their final maturities 
foreign currency exchange risk 
certain payments that third parties make to connetics australia are made in local currency or australian dollars 
any fluctuations in the currencies of our licensees or licensors against the australian or the us dollar will cause our royalty revenues and expenses to fluctuate as well 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
