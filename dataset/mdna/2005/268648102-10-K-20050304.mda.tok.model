table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles  including staff accounting bulletin sab  no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force  no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  fas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  fas no 
 accounting for leases  and sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  among others 
the application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems  software and services or a combination of these items 
as our business evolves  the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized 
additionally  revenue recognition involves judgments  including assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience and market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
should market or economic conditions deteriorate  our actual return experience could exceed our estimate 
warranty costs we accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  the amount of actual warranty costs could materially differ from our estimates 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts and notes receivable  investments  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience  the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate 
the determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held  market conditions  length of the impairment  magnitude of the impairment and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired 
the recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand  pricing  competition and changes in technology 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual recovery could be less than our estimate 
other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  changes in technology and customer demand 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
our goodwill valuation is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis performed at the reporting unit level 
the analysis factors in estimated revenue and expense growth rates 
the estimates are based upon 
table of contents our historical experience and projections of future activity  factoring in customer demand  changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
restructuring charges we recognized restructuring charges in   and prior years 
the restructuring charges include  among other items  estimated losses on the sale of real estate  employee termination benefit costs  subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts 
the amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors  including market conditions and negotiations with third parties 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not  do not establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
accounting for stock options we recognize stock option costs pursuant to apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in the notes to our financial statements 
effective for the quarter ended september   we will adopt the provisions of fas no 
r  share based payment 
both fas no 
and r require management to make assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options  including the expected life of the stock options and the volatility of the stock options 
changes to the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the underlying value of the stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance on determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for other than temporary impairments on debt and equity investments 
in september  the fasb delayed until further notice the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance contained in eitf  however the disclosure requirements of eitf are currently effective 
the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after november  
table of contents the provisions of statement no 
should be applied prospectively 
the adoption of fas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
r  share based payment 
the statement replaces fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the adoption of the statement will result in the expensing of the fair value of stock options granted to employees in the basic financial statements 
previously  we elected to only disclose the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements 
see accounting for stock based compensation in note a to the financial statements 
the statement is effective for the quarters commencing after june  the statement applies to new equity awards and to equity awards modified  repurchased  or canceled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the effective date 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated from the pro forma disclosures under statement no 
changes to the grant date fair value of equity awards granted before the effective date of this statement are precluded 
the compensation cost for those earlier awards shall be attributed to periods beginning on or after the effective date of this statement using the attribution method that was used under statement no 
 except that the method of recognizing forfeitures only as they occur shall not be continued 
any unearned or deferred compensation contra equity accounts related to those earlier awards shall be eliminated against the appropriate equity accounts 
additionally  common stock purchased pursuant to stock options granted under our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based upon the fair market value of the stock option 
the statement also allows for a modified version of retrospective application to periods before the effective date 
modified retrospective application may be applied either a to all prior years for which statement no 
was effective or b only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption 
an entity that chooses to apply the modified retrospective method to all prior years for which statement no 
was effective shall adjust financial statements for prior periods to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards granted  modified  or settled in cash in fiscal years beginning after december   on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by statement no 
accordingly  compensation cost and the related tax effects will be recognized in those financial statements as though they had been accounted for under statement no 
changes to amounts as originally measured on a pro forma basis are precluded 
the adoption of fas no 
r will have a material impact on our results of operations  increasing cost of sales  sg a expenses and r d expenses 
the future results will be impacted by the number and value of additional stock option grants as well as the value of existing unvested stock options 
we have utilized the black scholes option pricing model to determine the value of our stock options 
we estimated volatility to be  and in  and  respectively 
the decline in volatility in compared to the prior two years was due to our recent volatility experience 
we estimated the expected life of stock options that were issued to be years  years and years in  and  respectively 
the decline in the expected life in compared to the prior two years was due to a change in current exercise patterns 
for more information on the impact of expensing stock options on the three years ended december    and  see accounting for stock based compensation in note a to the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  which is an amendment to apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the 
table of contents exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the adoption of fas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the ajca was passed 
the ajca provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities which will be phased in from through in return  the ajca also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities by the american jobs creation act of fsp treats the deduction as a special deduction as described in fas no 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the same period in which the deduction is claimed in our tax return 
we are currently evaluating the impact the ajca will have on our results of operations and financial position 
the ajca also creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations 
we are currently evaluating the ajca and are not yet in a position to decide whether  or to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us  however  upon finalization of our assessment  it is reasonably possible that we will repatriate some amount given that our total unremitted earnings as of december  was approximately  the amount of income tax we would incur should we repatriate some level of earnings cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we expect to finalize our assessment sometime in

the forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions  divestitures or business combinations that may be completed after the date hereof 
our future results may differ materially from our past results and from those projected in the forward looking statements due to various uncertainties and risks  including but not limited to those set forth below  one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the sec 
we disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements contained herein after the date of this annual report 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions 
we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions 
if these conditions deteriorate  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a lessening demand in the information technology market 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our products and services 
delays or reductions in it spending  domestically or internationally  could materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in decreased revenues or earnings 
component costs  competitive pricing  and sales volume and mix could materially adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and earnings 
our gross margins are impacted by a variety of factors  including competitive pricing  component and product design costs as well as the volume and relative mixture of product and services revenues 
increased component costs  increased pricing pressures  the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product price  changes in product and services revenue mixture or decreased volume could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  gross margins or earnings 
the costs of third party components comprise a significant portion of our product costs 
while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs  we may have difficulty managing such costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase 
we currently expect that the availability of certain disk drives will be limited in the first half of so we may experience an increase in our component costs 
an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and earnings 
moreover  certain competitors may have advantages due to vertical integration of their supply chain  which may include disk drives  microprocessors  memory components and servers 
the markets in which we do business are highly competitive and we encounter aggressive price competition for all of our products and services from numerous companies globally 
there also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices or provide storage related products or services  together with other it products or services  at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve or gain market share 
such price competition may result in pressure on our product prices and reductions in product prices may have a material adverse effect on our revenues  gross margins and earnings 
we currently believe that pricing pressures are likely to continue 

table of contents if our suppliers are not able to meet our requirements  we could have decreased revenues and earnings 
we purchase or license many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers  including some of our competitors 
these components and products include disk drives  high density memory components  power supplies and software developed and maintained by third parties 
we have experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements 
if any of our suppliers were to cancel or materially change contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products  we could lose time sensitive customer orders  be unable to develop or sell certain products cost effectively or on a timely basis  if at all  and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  we periodically transition our product line to incorporate new technologies 
the importance of transitioning our customers smoothly to new technologies  along with our historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales  intensifies the risk that the failure of a supplier to meet our quality or delivery requirements will have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments 
as part of our business strategy  we seek to acquire businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these acquisitions are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business  which may include  among other things the effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies the failure of the acquisition to result in expected benefits  which may include benefits relating to enhanced revenues  technology  human resources  costs savings  operating efficiencies and other synergies the difficulty and cost of integrating the acquired business  including costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures and costs and delays caused by communication difficulties or geographic distances between the two companies sites the assumption of liabilities of the acquired business  including litigation related liabilities the potential impairment of acquired assets the lack of experience in new markets  products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar supply or distribution partners the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns the impairment of relationships with customers or suppliers of the acquired business or our customers or suppliers the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company the potential incompatibility of business cultures these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
to the extent that we issue shares of our common stock or other rights to purchase our common stock in connection with any future acquisition  existing stockholders may experience dilution and our earnings per share may decrease 
in addition to the risks commonly encountered in the acquisition of a business as described above  we may also experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction 
further  the risks described above may be exacerbated as a result of managing multiple acquisitions at the same time 

table of contents we also seek to invest in businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these investments are accompanied by risks similar to those encountered in an acquisition of a business 
we may be unable to keep pace with rapid industry  technological and market changes 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changing needs of customers 
there can be no assurance that our existing products will be properly positioned in the market or that we will be able to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis  or at all 
we spend a considerable amount of money on research and development and introduce new products from time to time 
there can be no assurance that enhancements to existing products and solutions or new products and solutions will receive customer acceptance 
as competition in the it industry increases  it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage and to leverage that advantage toward increased revenues and profits 
risks associated with the development and introduction of new products include delays in development and changes in data storage  networking and operating system technologies which could require us to modify existing products 
risks inherent in the transition to new products include the difficulty in forecasting customer preferences or demand accurately the inability to expand production capacity to meet demand for new products the impact of customers demand for new products on the products being replaced  thereby causing a decline in sales of existing products and an excessive  obsolete supply of inventory delays in initial shipments of new products further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors  competitors responses to the introductions and the desire by customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time 
our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis  keep pace with rapid industry  technological or market changes or effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the markets we serve are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively 
we compete with many companies in the markets we serve  certain of which offer a broad spectrum of it products and services and others which offer specific information storage  management or virtualization products or services 
some of these companies whether independently or by establishing alliances may have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers and greater opportunity to address customers various it requirements than us 
in addition  as the it industry consolidates  companies may improve their competitive position and ability to compete against us 
we compete on the basis of our products features  performance and price as well as our services 
our failure to compete on any of these bases could affect demand for our products or services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
companies may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish business models or technologies disruptive to us 
our business may be materially adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products  including hardware and software products and services by our competitors  and the implementation of effective marketing or sales strategies by our competitors 
the material adverse effect to our business could include a decrease in demand for our products and services and an increase in the length of our sales cycle due to customers taking longer to compare products and services and to complete their purchases 

table of contents we may have difficulty managing operations 
our future operating results will depend on our overall ability to manage operations  which includes  among other things retaining and hiring  as required  the appropriate number of qualified employees managing  protecting and enhancing  as appropriate  our infrastructure  including but not limited to  our information systems accurately forecasting revenues training our sales force to sell more software and services successfully integrating new acquisitions managing inventory levels  including minimizing excess and obsolete inventory  while maintaining sufficient inventory to meet customer demands controlling expenses managing our manufacturing capacity  real estate facilities and other assets executing on our plans an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expenses or a failure to manage other aspects of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of war or acts of terrorism 
terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our employees  facilities  customers  partners  suppliers  distributors and resellers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment  including receipt of components and distribution of products 
our business may suffer if we are unable to retain or attract key personnel 
our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees  the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining existing personnel or recruiting new personnel 
the loss of one or more key or other employees  our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our quarterly revenues and earnings could be materially adversely affected by uneven sales patterns and changing purchasing behaviors 
our quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter s total sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter 
this pattern makes prediction of revenues  earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
we believe this uneven sales pattern is a result of many factors including the relative dollar amount of our product and services offerings in relation to many of our customers budgets  resulting in long lead times for customers budgetary approval  which tends to be given late in a quarter the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase in the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from one or more competitors seeking their business 
table of contents the fourth quarter influence of customers spending their remaining capital budget authorization prior to new budget constraints in the first six months of the following year seasonal influences our uneven sales pattern also makes it extremely difficult to predict near term demand and adjust manufacturing capacity accordingly 
if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders  there will be excess inventory 
alternatively  if orders substantially exceed predicted demand  the ability to assemble  test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter may be limited  which could materially adversely affect quarterly revenues and earnings 
in addition  our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and our backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels 
this is because we assemble our products on the basis of our forecast of near term demand and maintain inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers we generally ship products shortly after receipt of the order customers may reschedule or cancel orders with little or no penalty loss of infrastructure  due to factors such as an information systems failure  loss of public utilities or extreme weather conditions  could impact our ability to ship products in a timely manner 
delays in product shipping or an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expenses  could intensify the impact of these factors on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  unanticipated changes in our customers purchasing behaviors such as customers taking longer to negotiate and complete their purchases or making smaller  incremental purchases based on their current needs  also make the prediction of revenues  earnings and working capital for each financial period difficult and uncertain and increase the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition 
risks associated with our distribution channels may materially adversely affect our financial results 
in addition to our direct sales force  we have agreements in place with many distributors  systems integrators  resellers and original equipment manufacturers to market and sell our products and services 
we may  from time to time  derive a significant percentage of our revenues from such distribution channels 
our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our contracts with channel partners were terminated  if our relationship with channel partners were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of our channel partners were to weaken 
in addition  as our market opportunities change  we may have an increased reliance on channel partners  which may negatively impact our gross margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding these channels 
if we are not successful  we may lose sales opportunities  customers and market share 
furthermore  the partial reliance on channel partners may materially reduce the visibility to our management of potential customers and demand for products and services  thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast such demand 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our channel partners will not develop  market or sell products or services in competition with us in the future 
in addition  as we focus on new market opportunities and additional customers through our various distribution channels  including small to medium sized businesses  we may be required to provide different levels of service and support than we typically provided in the past 
we may have difficulty managing directly or indirectly through our channels these different service and support requirements and may be required to incur substantial costs to provide such services which may adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents changes in foreign conditions could impair our international operations 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside the united states 
in addition  a substantial portion of our products is manufactured outside of the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade restrictions  import or export licensing requirements  the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and longer payment cycles in certain countries 
undetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing of our products by us or our suppliers were to occur  we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair  replacement or service costs and potential damage to our reputation 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities  control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing are critical factors in our future growth 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor  develop  modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with alliances 
we have alliances with leading information technology companies and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies 
any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances  certain of which have substantially greater financial  marketing or technological resources than us  will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future  discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors 
our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property 
we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
however  there can be no assurance that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
further  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that we may require to conduct our business or that  if obtainable  such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent or other intellectual property rights 
responding to any such claim  regardless of its merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party  and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 
from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  we may become involved in various legal proceedings  including patent  commercial  product liability  employment  class action  whistleblower and other litigation and claims  and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  because litigation is inherently unpredictable  there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses 
additionally  the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
from time to time  we are subject to income tax audits 
while we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws  there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes 
should we be assessed with additional taxes  there could be a material adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition 
changes in regulations could materially adversely affect us 
our business  results of operations or financial conditions could be materially adversely affected if laws  regulations or standards relating to us or our products are newly implemented or changed 
in addition  our compliance with existing regulations  such as the sarbanes oxley act of  may have a material adverse impact on us 
under sarbanes oxley  we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
compliance with this legislation may divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expense 
should we or our independent auditors determine that we have material weaknesses in our internal controls  our results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected or our stock price may decline 
our stock price is volatile 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as the announcement of acquisitions  new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our operating results changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community speculation in the press or investment community in addition  our stock price is affected by general economic and market conditions and has been negatively affected by unfavorable global economic and market conditions 
if such conditions deteriorate  our stock price could decline 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and credit risk 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk management as a multinational corporation  we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
any foreign currency transaction  defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  will be reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period 
the primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet 
therefore  the change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the euro  the japanese yen  the british pound and the brazil real 
additionally  we have exposure to emerging market economies  particularly in latin america and south east asia 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
in all cases  we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
the success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
the instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes 
we employ a monte carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position 
this model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are calculated by bearmeasurisk as of december  this model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions  using a confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
the value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was million as of december  and million as of december  the average  high and low value at risk amounts for and were as follows in millions average high low the average value represents an average of the quarter end values 
the high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities 
the investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in us dollars 
these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
these instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes 

table of contents a portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities that are subject to prepayment risk 
we employ a monte carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for changes in interest rates for our combined investment portfolios 
this model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the bearmeasurisk dataset as of december  this model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in interest rates  using a confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
the value at risk on the investment portfolios was million as of december  and million as of december  the average  high and low value at risk amounts for and were as follows in millions average high low the average value represents an average of the quarter end values 
the high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts 
credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  short and long term investments  accounts and notes receivable and foreign currency exchange contracts 
deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
generally  these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 
we place our temporary cash investments and short and long term investments primarily in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment with any one issuer 
we purchased bank loans with credit ratings below investment grade 
the bank loans have a senior position to other debt and have floating rate coupons  which significantly reduces interest rate risk 
as of december   bank loans represent of our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments 
we believe this investment strategy more effectively manages our exposure to interest rate risk and diversifies our investment portfolio 
we have entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis 
under these securities lending agreements  the value of the collateral is equal to of the fair market value of the loaned securities
