item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of future results 
overview since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of blood safety systems and  more recently  immunotherapies for cancer and infectious disease 
we have been unprofitable since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
except for the intercept blood system for platelets  for which the european union approved issuance of a ce mark  all of our product candidates are in the research and development stage 
we have not received significant revenue to date from product sales 
we must conduct significant research  development  pre clinical and clinical evaluation  commercialization and regulatory compliance activities on these product candidates that  together with anticipated general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until after commercialization of additional products 
our ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on our ability to successfully complete development and obtain additional regulatory approvals of  and on the abilities of our partners and us to commercialize and achieve market acceptance of  blood safety and immunotherapy product candidates 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to collaborative arrangements  contract research and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities  including clinical trials  pre clinical safety studies  external laboratory studies and development activities performed by baxter 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  which have been reviewed by our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue and research and development expenses revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under development contracts is recognized as the costs on the project are incurred 
revenue related to at risk milestones specified under development contracts is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
license fees and payments for achieved milestones are non refundable and are not subject to future performance 
we have received up front payments from collaboration agreements 
these up front payments are deferred and recognized over the period to which the payments relate 
we receive certain united states government grants that support our research effort in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
revenue associated with these grants is recognized as costs under each grant are incurred 
short term investments we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents consist principally of short term money market instruments and commercial paper 
we have classified all debt securities as available for sale at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
long term investments we account for our investment in equity securities of bioone under the cost method 
our use of the cost method is based  in part  on our determination that we lack ability to exert significant influence over bioone 
under the cost method  we also assess whether there is impairment of the value of the asset as of each period end 
accrued liabilities we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities  including clinical trials  pre clinical safety studies  external laboratory studies and development activities performed by baxter  for research and development services performed 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
collaborations agreement with medimmune 
in april  we entered into an agreement with medimmune to co develop a therapeutic vaccine designed to target antigens expressed in breast  prostate and colon cancer  as well as metastatic melanoma 
a vaccine is being developed in this collaboration using our listeria vaccine platform and medimmune s epha cancer antigen 
under the terms of the agreement  medimmune is responsible for clinical testing  manufacturing and commercialization of any product resulting from this collaboration 
we are responsible for pre clinical development of a therapeutic vaccine candidate 
we are receiving development funding and may receive contingent milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
in may  we received an up front payment of million from medimmune 
the up front payment is being deferred and recognized ratably as development funding over the pre clinical development period 
restructured agreements with baxter for commercialization of the intercept blood system 
prior to february  we shared development expenses with baxter for the intercept blood systems for platelets and red blood cells under our development and commercialization agreements 
the agreements provided for us to be solely responsible for funding development expenses for the intercept blood system for plasma 
we recognized  of development funding under these agreements during the year ended december  under the agreements  baxter has been responsible for manufacturing and marketing the intercept blood system for platelets  which is approved for sale in some countries in europe 
the agreements provided for us to receive approximately of revenue from sales of system disposables after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods to the extent cost exceeds specific amounts 
we did not recognize revenue from product sales during the year ended december   because revenue sharing payments were being withheld by baxter due to a dispute over the timing of repayment of a loan to us from baxter capital 
we entered into agreements with baxter in february that reaffirmed our previous agreements in certain respects and modified them in other respects 
under the february agreements  baxter retained the right and responsibility to market and sell  sometimes referred to as commercialization rights for  the intercept blood system for platelets worldwide 
baxter also retains commercialization rights for the intercept blood system for plasma in all parts of the world except north america 
baxter retains these commercialization rights  in general  through baxter has options to extend these commercialization rights for successive two year periods after baxter s commercialization rights for the platelet system are subject to the rights of bioone in japan and certain other asian countries under agreements previously signed with bioone 
if a transaction is completed with bioone for the plasma system in such countries  baxter s rights will also be subject to that agreement 
pursuant to the february agreements  we gained commercialization rights to the intercept blood system for plasma in north america and commercialization rights to the intercept blood system for red blood cells worldwide 
as to such regions  our license to baxter terminated and baxter granted us a license to any baxter technology included in the plasma system and the red blood cell system  respectively 
in addition  if baxter does not exercise its option to extend its commercialization rights after  or any subsequent two year period  we will gain the commercialization rights for the products and countries that baxter then holds 
under the february agreements  baxter remains solely responsible for sales and marketing expenses for the products countries as to which it maintains commercialization rights 
for and  baxter has agreed to fund million of expenses for intercept blood system sales and marketing and for activities directed toward ce mark approval of the plasma system 
it has also agreed to furnish specified levels of personnel to conduct sales and marketing of the intercept blood system for platelets and  upon approval  plasma in europe 
our agreements with baxter provide for sales and marketing strategy surrounding baxter s commercialization rights to be set by a joint cerus baxter governance committee 
we will have responsibility for sales and marketing expenses for any products countries for which we gain commercialization rights 
we have the sole discretion  however  to determine the extent of such expenditures 
so long as baxter retains commercialization rights for the platelet system or plasma system in particular countries  baxter will continue to manufacture that system for sale in such countries 
baxter and we will continue to share revenues from such sales generally according to the terms of the previous agreements 
the agreements continue to provide for us to receive approximately of revenue from sales of platelet system disposables after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods to the extent cost exceeds specific amounts  and for us to receive and baxter to receive of revenue from sales of plasma system disposables  in each case after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods and a specified percentage  not to exceed of revenue  is retained by baxter for marketing and administrative expenses 
for those countries where we gained commercialization rights under the february agreements  baxter has agreed to manufacture systems and components  on a cost plus basis  until if baxter elects to extend its commercialization rights beyond december   the manufacturing period will be extended until approximately two years after the expiration of baxter s extended commercialization rights 
as the agreements do not require baxter to manufacture in an fda approved facility  additional validation steps may be required of us before use of such items in the united states 
baxter has agreed to supply only very limited types of components for the prototype red blood cell system 
the february agreements require us to pay royalties to baxter on intercept blood system products sold by us  or our affiliates  pursuant to our commercialization rights 
the royalties vary by product  and do not exceed of net sales for any products 
our arrangement with baxter to equally fund development work for the platelet system and the red blood cell system also was terminated by the february agreements 
commencing january   each company bears its own expenses regarding our discussions with the fda to gain clarity on the remaining steps in the us regulatory process for the platelet system 
following such discussions  baxter may continue to retain its commercialization rights for the platelet system in north america provided it funds of development expenses directed toward obtaining fda approval and also commits to specified levels of sales and marketing expenditures for the product 
under the agreements  baxter ceases to have any obligation to fund development of the red blood cell system 
cerus remains responsible for funding of development expenses for the plasma system  except that million of baxter s million commitment described above may be applied to activities directed toward obtaining ce mark approval of the plasma system 
baxter has agreed to cooperate with cerus to complete certain activities required for the ce mark application 
such activities shall  except for the right to apply such million  be at cerus expense 
under a separate agreement with baxter capital relating to the million loan and accrued interest  we paid million to baxter capital in february and entered into a promissory note for million  payable with interest in december baxter capital has agreed to accept these payments in full satisfaction of the loan obligation  and baxter capital and we have dismissed the related legal actions 
agreements with bioone 
in june  baxter and we entered into an agreement with bioone for commercialization of the intercept blood system for platelets in parts of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  bioone is responsible  at its expense  for seeking regulatory approvals and will have exclusive rights to market and distribute the intercept blood system for platelets in japan  china  taiwan  south korea  thailand  vietnam and singapore  following bioone s receipt of regulatory approval in each of those countries 
in july and october  baxter and we each received up front payments of million 
we are deferring the up front payments and recognizing amounts ratably as development funding over the expected period to regulatory approval 
the agreement also provides for contingent milestone payments and royalties on future product sales  which would be shared equally by baxter and us 
we recognized million of revenue under this agreement during the year ended december  in december  baxter and we signed a letter of intent with bioone to enter into a definitive agreement for commercialization of the intercept blood system for plasma in parts of asia 
under the letter of intent  we received a payment of million from bioone 
our right to retain the up front payment is not contingent upon completion of the definitive agreement 
the payment is recorded as deferred revenue as of december  terms specified in the letter of intent are subject to the parties entering into a definitive agreement 
under the letter of intent  baxter and we are restricted from negotiating a similar agreement with other parties before april cooperative agreements with the armed forces of the united states 
in february  we were awarded a million cooperative agreement by the army medical research acquisition activity division of the department of defense 
in september  may  january and july  we were awarded additional funding of million  million  million and million  respectively  all of which was awarded to continue funding of projects to develop our pathogen inactivation technologies to improve the safety and availability of blood that may be used by the armed forces for medical transfusions 
under the conditions of the agreements  we are conducting research on the inactivation of infectious pathogens in blood  including unusual viruses  bacteria and parasites  which are of particular concern to the armed forces 
this funding also supports advanced development of our blood safety technologies 
in october  we received a million award from the army medical research acquisition activity division of the department of defense for the research and development of vaccines for biodefense and cancer 
the awards fund work to be performed through november agreement with kirin 
in january  we entered into a collaborative agreement with the pharmaceutical division of kirin to develop and market products for stem cell transplantation based on our helinx technology 
under the terms of the agreement  we will jointly develop the products with kirin 
we received an initial license fee of million 
the license fee is being deferred and recognized as development funding ratably over the development period 
we do not expect to receive additional funding from kirin 
although the agreement calls for kirin to fund all development expenses for the asia pacific region and a portion of our development activities toward obtaining product approval in the united states  no such development activities co funded by kirin are currently ongoing 
upon product approval  kirin has exclusive rights to market the products in the asia pacific region  including japan  china  korea and australia  and we would receive a specified share of product revenue  including a royalty and reimbursement of our cost of goods 
we retain all marketing rights for the rest of the world  including the united states and europe 
agreement with the national marrow donor program 
in october  we entered into an agreement with the national marrow donor program  or nmdp  a non profit corporation  under which the nmdp sponsored a clinical trial of our allogeneic cellular immune therapy in patients receiving matched unrelated bone marrow transplants 
the agreement was amended in december under the amended agreement  we provided our helinx compound amotosalen  illumination devices  training of clinical sites and program oversight in exchange for reimbursement by the nmdp of our related costs 
the amended agreement expired on march  results of operations compared with revenue 
for the year ended december   milestone and development funding from baxter increased to million from million for the increase was primarily due to the termination of the phase iii red blood cell clinical trials in september  for which baxter was incurring greater expenses than us 
development funding is in the form of balancing payments made by baxter to us  if necessary  to reimburse us for development spending in excess of the levels determined by baxter and us 
as a result of the february agreements  we do not expect to recognize additional development funding from baxter for the platelet and red blood cell programs 
development funding from baxter was of total revenue for development funding from other sources  which included medimmune  bioone  kirin and the nmdp  increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to development funding from medimmune and from up front payments received from medimmune and bioone that were deferred and are being recognized ratably over the respective development periods 
revenue recognized from kirin in and was from the up front payment that was deferred and recognized ratably over the development period 
there is no development activity co funded by kirin currently ongoing or planned at cerus 
the agreement with the nmdp expired on march  development funding from medimmune  bioone  kirin and the nmdp was   and less than  respectively  of total revenue for revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to increased program expenditures under the cooperative agreements with the armed forces  largely in support of research and development applicable to the intercept blood system for plasma 
in  we expect revenue from the armed forces for blood safety programs to be less than amounts recognized in  however  we expect to recognize additional revenue from the armed forces for the research and development of vaccines for biodefense and cancer 
during  we also recognized million of revenue from eight separate research grants from the national institutes of health  including amounts recognized under a million grant to develop an anthrax vaccine 
we may not receive additional government grants in the future 
we recognized  of product sales revenue in from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe 
as a result of the loan dispute with baxter capital  recognition of product sales revenue in has been deferred until payment of such revenue is expected to be collected 
as a result of the resolution of the loan dispute with baxter capital in february  we expect to recognize product sales revenue in the intercept blood system for platelets is currently undergoing validation studies and regulatory reimbursement review in many european countries 
we do not expect sales of the system in europe to be significant at least until the system is approved for sale and reimbursement rates are established in the larger market european countries 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for scientific personnel  payments to consultants  payments for licensed technologies  supplies and chemicals used in in house laboratories  costs of research and development facilities  depreciation of equipment and external contract research expenses  including clinical trials  pre clinical safety studies  manufacturing development and other laboratory studies 
research and development expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to reduced development spending by baxter  the termination of phase iii clinical trials in the red blood cell program in september and our june restructuring 
our total research and development costs for included million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs  including vaccine programs  while research and development costs in included million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses for will decrease relative to  primarily as a result of our june restructuring 
due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical and biopharmaceutical products  including but not limited to intense and changing government regulation  uncertainty of future pre clinical and clinical study results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs to complete these research and development projects 
we face numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of our research and development projects  see risk factors above 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to fewer administrative personnel and consultants in as a result of our june restructuring 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in relative to as a result of our restructuring 
restructuring 
on june   we announced that we realigned our operations to increase resources for our program to develop therapeutic vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases and reduce expenditures for our blood safety programs and administrative expenses 
as a result of the realignment  we reduced our workforce by approximately and reduced our operating expenses 
we recorded aggregate charges of million during the second and third quarters of related to this restructuring 
restructuring costs primarily include severance benefits to employees terminated as part of the restructuring 
we do not expect to record further costs related to this restructuring 
net interest expense 
net interest expense was million for  down slightly from million in in and  we accrued interest expense at on the million loan from baxter capital 
in  we expect interest expense to be reduced significantly as a result of the february resolution of the loan dispute with baxter capital 
we will accrue interest expense at on a million note payable to baxter capital 
interest income from investments was million for compared to million for the change was primarily due to more favorable yields on investments as a result of increases in market interest rates 
we expect to earn interest income at market rates in proportion to the marketable securities balances we maintain 
compared with revenue 
for the year ended december   milestone and development funding from related parties decreased to million from million for amounts recognized in were from baxter for development of the intercept blood system for platelets  whereas in a million milestone payment from baxter was earned upon regulatory approval of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe 
development funding from baxter was of total revenue for development funding from other sources  which included kirin and the nmdp  decreased to million for from million for revenue recognized from kirin in was from the up front payment that was deferred and recognized ratably over the development period 
there is no development activity co funded by kirin currently ongoing or planned at cerus 
development funding from the nmdp was of total revenue for development funding from kirin was of total revenue for revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to a million increase in program expenditures under the cooperative agreements with the armed forces of the united states  most of this increase supporting research and development applicable to the intercept blood system 
during  we also recognized million of revenue from six separate research grants from the national institutes of health 
we recognized  and  of product sales revenue in and  respectively  from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to reduced development spending by baxter and also to the termination of phase iii clinical trials in the red blood cell program in september our total research and development costs included million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs for  and million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs for general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for from million for the slight decrease was primarily due to the employment of fewer administrative personnel and consultants in net interest income expense 
net interest expense was million for compared to net interest income of million for we received proceeds from a million loan from baxter capital in january and recorded million of related interest expense in interest income from investments was million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to reduced yields on investments as a result of declines in market interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of capital to date have primarily consisted of public offerings and private placements of equity securities  the loan from baxter capital  payments received under our agreements with baxter  bioone  medimmune and others  united states government grants and cooperative agreements and interest income 
to date  we have not received significant revenue from product sales and we will not derive significant revenue from product sales unless and until one or more products receive regulatory approval and achieve market acceptance 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to million in the reduction in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the net loss of million  favorable changes in other operating balances of million  including an increase in deferred revenue associated with the bioone and medimmune agreements and a reduction in amounts receivable from the united states government  and non cash operating expenses  including million of depreciation expense 
net cash provided by investing activities of million resulted primarily from sales and maturities of short term investments being greater than the combination of purchases of short term investments and the million investment we made in bioone equity securities during the period 
working capital decreased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to the net loss for in february  we entered into an agreement with baxter capital under which we paid million to baxter capital and entered into a promissory note for million  payable with interest in december baxter capital has agreed to accept these payments in full satisfaction of the million loan and accrued interest under the previous loan obligation  and the parties have agreed to dismiss all related legal actions 
we believe that our available cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from existing development and grant arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least through december  these near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including the development progress and costs of the intercept blood system and our therapeutic vaccine programs  payments from our development and commercialization partners  including medimmune and bioone  and from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will be dependent on these factors and on the outcome of ongoing securities class action and derivative lawsuits against us  our ability to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financings or through additional collaborative arrangements or government grants  development progress in our vaccine programs  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of the intercept blood system and other product candidates  competitive developments and regulatory factors 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to our investors  and may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
in august  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to offer and sell up to million of common stock and or debt securities 
in june  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock with gross proceeds  calculated for registration statement purposes  of million under the shelf registration statement 
we have no current commitments to offer or sell additional securities pursuant to this registration statement 
commitments our commitments are as follows payments due by period  from december  total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations loan and interest payable to a related party minimum purchase requirements license fees and sponsored research operating leases total contractual cash obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and limit duration by restricting the term for single securities and for the portfolio as a whole
