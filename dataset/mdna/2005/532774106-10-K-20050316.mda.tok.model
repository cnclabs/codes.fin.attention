table of contents executive summary we are an owner and operator of television stations in mid sized markets in the united states and puerto rico 
our operating revenues are derived from the sale of advertising time to local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from the networks for the broadcast of their programming and from other broadcast related activities 
we recorded net income of million in compared with net losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the following are some of our operating highlights and significant changes for compared to we increased our net revenues by million largely due to political revenues and local revenue growth 
we launched mtv puerto rico in the third quarter of on our second station in puerto rico 
we launched a us spanish language programming service called wapa america  using locally produced news and entertainment programming from our puerto rico stations 
we decreased our net interest expense by million by refinancing our debt 
we paid million on the principal amount of our outstanding debt 
we reversed our federal tax valuation allowance  resulting in a benefit from income taxes of million compared to a provision of million in this reversal was based on the cumulative positive operating results of the last several years and on our future projections that reflects the expectation that we will be able to use of our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
industry trends the broadcast television industry is reliant primarily on advertising revenues and faces increased competition from existing and new technologies 
the following summarizes certain of the competitive forces and risks that may impact our future operating results 
for a discussion of other factors that may affect our business  see factors that may affect future results 
the number of national program services has increased the competition for national advertising dollars resulting in a greater percentage of advertising revenues shifting from national advertisers to local advertisers 
we received of our revenues from local advertisers in compared to in we expect this trend to continue 
we no longer have exclusive rights to off network programs for time periods where we do not air our local news or network programs 
many of these programs now air on national cable channels or can be purchased on dvds by our television audience 
these alternatives have created a further fragmentation of our television audience  making it more difficult to maintain or increase the rates we charge our advertisers 
our ability to internally grow our business is largely depended on the future conversion of analog to digital television receivers and the acceptance of digital television by our television audience 
congress and the fcc has not audiences from mandated a final conversion date 
political revenues from elections and revenues from olympic games  which occur on years ending in an even date  except for a small number of state and local odd year elections  continue to create fluctuations in our operating results on a year to year comparison 
in addition  the television bureau of advertising reported that us television advertising decreased in due to the impact of the war in iraq and the loss of political revenue 
us television advertising increased in due largely to political advertising and the olympic games 
we depend on automotive related advertising  which represents approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a significant change in these advertising revenues could materially affect our future results of operations 

table of contents business transactions we have developed our business through a combination of acquisitions  dispositions and organic growth 
we have acquired or disposed of the following businesses and assets during the last three years type of business asset acquisition disposition date business asset transaction transaction price may  weyi tv disposition million may  wtin tv acquisition million january  wirs tv acquisition million december  and june  licenses to mhz spectrum channels acquisition million june  krbc tv kacb tv disposition million may  kfyr tv kvly tv disposition million may  wpri tv  wnac tv operated as an lma  weyi tv  wupw tv  wdtn tv  krbc tv  kacb tv acquisition million of common stock and options april  wctx tv acquisition million april  wnac tv disposition million promissory note january  wvbt tv acquisition million january  wotv tv acquisition million subsequent developments on january   we closed on an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due these notes were an add on to an existing indenture we issued in may for million in aggregate principle amount of senior subordinated notes due the proceeds from the january offering were used to retire all million principal amount of our senior notes due outstanding 
this repayment will result in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million during the first quarter of on february   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire wndy  the upn affiliate serving indianapolis  indiana  and wwho  the upn affiliate serving columbus  ohio  from viacom  inc for million in cash  which will be funded by a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from our senior credit facility 
on march   we replaced our senior credit facility 
under this new facility  we obtained a million term loan  the proceeds of which were used to repay the balance on our existing term loan and for general business purposes  and a million revolving credit facility which will be used  in combination with cash on hand  to fund the purchase of wndy tv and wwho tv  during the first half of we are required to make mandatory payments on the new term loan of million per quarter beginning march  the term loan and revolving credit facility expire on march  and march   respectively 
the new facility contains covenants similar to that of the old facility 

table of contents critical accounting policies  estimates and recently issued accounting pronouncements the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  program rights  income taxes  pensions  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we are required to record an impairment charge 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and the introduction of impairment testing in its place 
we test the impairment of our broadcast licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of broadcast licenses with their carrying amount on a station by station basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method  assuming a hypothetical startup scenario that excludes network compensation payments 
we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a station with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of a station is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect historical performance of the station and prevailing values in the markets for broadcasting properties 
if the fair value of the station exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the station exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation  using the station s fair value as determined in the first step described above as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as required by sfas no 
 we completed a transitional impairment test for goodwill and broadcast licenses as of january  as a result of this test  an impairment of million million  net of tax benefit was recorded in the first quarter of to reflect the write down of certain broadcast licenses to their fair value 
we completed annual tests for impairment of goodwill and broadcast licenses as of december   and as a result of these tests  no impairment was required as of december   an impairment of million was recorded as of december  and no impairment charge was required as of december  the assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our business plans and overall expectations as to market and economic considerations 

table of contents network affiliations different broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we use 
these different assumptions may result in the use of different valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets between broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
these attributes and their impact on audiences can include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market determines how many television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market 
the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting 
television stations that have been broadcasting since the late s  generally channels two to thirteen  are viewed more often than newer television stations 
vhf stations  generally channels two to thirteen are typically viewed more often than uhf stations generally channels fourteen to sixty nine because these stations have been broadcasting longer than uhf stations and because of the inferior uhf signal in the early years of uhf stations 
the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within a market ie the value of being licensed in the smallest city within a tri city market has less value than being licensed in the largest city within a tri city market 
the audience acceptance of the broadcast licensee s local news programming and community involvement 
a local television station s news programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide a larger audience for its network programming 
the quality of the other non network programming carried by the television station 
a local television station s syndication programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide larger audience lead ins to its network programming 
a local television station can be the number one station in a market  regardless of the national ranking of its affiliated network  depending on the factors or attributes listed above 
abc  fox  nbc  and cbs each have multiple affiliations with local television stations that have the largest prime time audience in the local market in which the station operates 
other broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that vhf stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
in connection with our purchase of sunrise television corp 
in may  we acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired in the sunrise transaction was based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in these specific markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to the television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in each market beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
if we were to assign higher values to acquired network affiliation agreements and  therefore  less value to broadcast licenses  it would have a significant impact on our operating results 
the following chart reflects the hypothetical impact of the hypothetical reassignment of value from broadcast licenses to network affiliations and the resulting increase in amortization expense assuming a year amortization period for the year ended december  in thousands 
table of contents percentage of total value reassigned to network affiliation agreements as reported balance sheet as of december  broadcast licenses other intangible assets  net including network affiliation agreements statement of operations for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization of intangible assets operating income income from continuing operations net income net income per diluted share in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from the sunrise acquisition values due to different attributes of each station and the market in which it operates 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such a determination was made 
in the fourth quarter of  we reversed our tax valuation allowance related to federal income taxes which resulted in a million increase in our benefit from income taxes 
we made the determination that it was likely that our deferred tax assets would be realized in the future based on the positive evidence of our historical performance over the last three years and on our projections of future results of operations 
lower interest rates and decreased debt levels were key factors in our determination 
revenue recognition we recognize broadcast revenue during the financial statement period in which advertising is aired 
barter revenue is accounted for at the fair value of the assets or services received  or the advertising time surrendered  whichever is more clearly evident 
barter revenue is recorded at the time the advertising is broadcast  and barter expense is recorded at the time the assets or services are used 
we recognized barter revenue in the amounts of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we incurred barter expense in the amounts of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recorded for options issued to employees in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  through disclosure only 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income loss if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation in thousands year ended december  net income loss  as reported add stock based employee compensation expense  included in reported net income loss  net of tax effect deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards  net of tax effect pro forma net income loss basic net income loss per common share  as reported basic net income loss per common share  pro forma diluted net income loss per common share  as reported diluted net income loss per common share  pro forma amortization of program rights we amortize program rights over the estimated broadcast period of the underlying programs 
program rights are analyzed by management on an ongoing basis through a review of ratings  program schedules and revenue projections  among other factors 
if the projected future net revenues are less than the current carrying value of the program rights  we write down the program rights to equal the amount of projected future net revenues 
our total program rights were million  and million at december  and  respectively 
retirement plan actuarial assumptions our retirement benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of statement of financial accounting standards no 
employer s accounting for pensions sfas no 

two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions involve employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we decreased our discount rate to in from in to reflect market interest rate conditions 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense 
our long term expected return on plan assets was in both and recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is effective for reporting periods beginning after june  sfas no 
r requires us to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for the company s equity instruments 
currently  in accordance with apb opinion  we record the intrinsic value of stock based compensation as expense 
accordingly  no compensation expense is generally recognized for our fixed stock option plans as the exercise price equals the stock price on the date of grant 
under sfas r  we will be required to measure compensation expense over the options vesting period based on the stock options fair value at the date the options are granted 

table of contents sfas r allows for the use of the black scholes or a lattice option pricing model to value such options 
as allowed by sfas r  the company can elect either modified prospective application  which applies the statement to new awards and modified awards after the effective date  and to any unvested awards as service is rendered on or after the effective date  or modified retrospective application which can apply the effect of the statement to either all prior years for which sfas was effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of adoption 
we are currently evaluating which method of valuation and application will be used 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
fas 
fas eliminates the exception to account for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets at carrying value and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance  otherwise  the exchange principal of fair value applies 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
fas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the provisions of fas are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
on february   the emerging issues task force issued eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf which is effective for all reporting periods ending after december  eitf requires contingently convertible instruments to be included in diluted earnings per share regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
as a result  diluted income per share includes the effect of our contingently convertible debt on an as converted basis for the year ended december  results of operations set forth below are the significant factors that contributed to our operating results for the years ended december   and our results of operations from year to year are significantly affected by the impact of our acquisition of sunrise television corporation sunrise in and the consolidation of banks broadcasting in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin r consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
effective march   and as a result  our future reported financial results may not be comparable to the historical financial information and comparisons of any years may not be indicative of future financial performance

table of contents three year comparison net revenues net revenues consist primarily of national and local airtime sales  net of sales adjustments and agency commissions 
additional  but less significant  amounts are generated from network compensation  internet revenues  barter revenues  production revenues  tower rental income and carriage or retransmission agreements 
net revenues increased or million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  which was driven by increased political and local revenue 
political revenue increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year as a result of the presidential election cycle 
we expect political revenue to decrease substantially in  as it is not an election year 
local airtime sales increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
we operate the number one or number two local news station in of our markets and generated of our advertising revenues from local news sales in local advertising revenue has become increasingly important to our industry and is typically a more stable source of revenue than national time sales 
as a result  we continued to emphasize growing our local business during net revenue attributable to banks broadcasting  which was consolidated in accordance with fin r effective march   was million for the year ended december  net revenues remained relatively flat at million for the year ended december  compared to net revenue of million for the prior year 
the parity in net revenue was due largely to a decrease in political revenues of million for the year ended december  as a result of the campaign election cycle and a reduction in advertising revenues due to the outbreak of war in iraq 
the decrease was offset by the may acquisition of the sunrise television stations  which resulted in an additional million of net revenue for the year ended december  operating costs and expenses direct operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets  consisting primarily of news  engineering  programming and music licensing costs  increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to increased expenses of million attributable to the consolidation of banks broadcasting and salary increases 
direct operating expenses increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to the may acquisition of the sunrise television stations  which resulted in an additional million of direct operating expenses 
our direct operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets at our stations other than the sunrise stations were relatively flat in as a result of savings associated with us centralizing our master control transmission facilities  which offset general cost increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses  consisting primarily of employee salaries  sales commissions and other employee benefit costs  advertising and promotional expenses  increased million or for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the increase was driven primarily by million of expenses attributable to the consolidation of banks broadcasting  a million or increase in local sales commissions due to the increase in local airtime sales and a million increase in compensation expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was driven by a million increase as a result of the may acquisition of the sunrise television stations 
the remaining increase is primarily due to a million increase in pension expense due to market conditions affecting our retirement funds  a million increase in property tax expense due to a combination of the addition of digital equipment  and a general increase in property tax rates  an increase in insurance expense of million and an increase of million in legal expenses primarily due to labor negotiations at several of our stations 
selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents amortization of program rights represents costs associated with the acquisition of syndicated programming  features and specials 
amortization of program rights increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is the result a million increase in the write downs associated with several program rights due to lower projected revenue streams for those programs and million attributable to the consolidation of banks broadcasting  offset by lower program costs at certain of our stations due to a combination of lower prices and nonrenewals of certain programming contracts 
amortization of program rights increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to the may acquisition of the sunrise television stations  which resulted in an additional million of amortization expense and million as a result of writing down several program rights due to lower projected revenue streams for those programs 
corporate expenses  related to costs associated with the centralized management of our stations  increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
of the million increase  million is attributable to the consolidation of banks broadcasting 
the remaining increase is primarily due to severance costs of million related to the departure of a company executive and an increase in audit fees of million related to corporate governance and related compliance activities 
corporate expenses increased million or for the year ended december   compared to the prior year due to an increase in pension expense of approximately million due to market conditions affecting our retirement funds  million in directors and officers insurance expense  million in due diligence related to potential acquisitions and professional fees as a result of increased activities related to corporate governance and related compliance activities and million for severance pay and benefits related to centralizing the master control transmission facilities in indianapolis  indiana and springfield  massachusetts 
depreciation and amortization of intangible assets remained relatively flat for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased million or for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the increase is partially due to the may acquisition of the sunrise television stations  which resulted in an additional million of depreciation and amortization expense 
the remaining increase is the result of increased capital additions related to the digital conversion and maximization efforts and the clustering of our master control transmission facilities 
as a result of our annual impairment test for goodwill and broadcast license  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million reflected in operating expenses for the year ended december  this charge reflects the write down of certain broadcast licenses resulting from a discounted cash flow forecast that uses industry averages to determine the fair value of the licenses 
the decrease in fair value was the result of the decline in the advertising market during and  which decreased industry station operating margins and therefore the value of our broadcast licenses 
other income expense the following table summarizes our total net interest expense year ended december  components of interest expense senior credit facility  senior subordinated notes  senior subordinated notes  exchangeable senior subordinated debentures  senior notes  senior discount notes  senior discount notes interest income total interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased million or for the year ended december  and million or for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  and  respectively  due to lower outstanding borrowings and lower average interest rates 

table of contents share of income in equity investments increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of improved operating performance of the stations included in our joint venture with nbc and the wand tv partnership 
share of income in equity investments decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the operating performance of the stations included in our joint venture with banks broadcasting and the wand tv partnership 
the gain on derivative instruments  derived from the mark to market of such instruments  increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this increase was due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
gain on derivative instruments decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior period 
our derivative instruments during and consisted of the embedded derivatives within our exchangeable senior subordinated debentures and in consisted of interest rate collars and cap and swap arrangements 
the decrease in gain on derivative instruments was due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
other items we recorded a loss of million for the year ended december   related to the write off of unamortized financing fees  discounts and associated costs in connection with the early extinguishment of million of senior notes due we recorded a loss of million for the year ended december   related to the write off of unamortized financing fees  discounts and associated costs in connection with the early redemption of all of our senior discount notes and senior subordinated notes and the repurchase of million principal amount of the senior notes due we incurred a million expense in related to the termination of the monitoring and oversight agreement with hicks muse and the amendment of the financial advisory agreement with hicks muse to eliminate the terms requiring the payment of transaction fees 
we recorded a loss of million related to an investment in an internet company in the second quarter of and million in the second quarter of this amount reflected an impairment of our initial investment as a result of a reduction in the value of the internet company  which in the opinion of management  was other than temporary 
income taxes our benefit from income taxes increased to million for the year ended december   from a provision of million for the prior year 
in  based on all available evidence  we determined that a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result of this determination  our income tax benefit includes the benefit of million from the reduction of the valuation allowance 
this was offset by an increased tax provision related to recording increased income from continuing operations for the year ended december  compared to the prior period 
our provision for income taxes decreased to million for the year ended december  from a provision of million for the prior year 
the federal and state provisions for the year ended december  were primarily created by an increase in the valuation allowance against the increase in our net deferred tax asset position during the year 
the foreign provision for the year ended december  was primarily created as a result of foreign operating income for the year ended december  the provision for the year ended december  was primarily attributed to book income for the year and a charge of million to initially establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset position 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds for working capital have historically been cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility as well as funds from our initial public offering in may at december   we had cash of million and an undrawn  but committed million revolving credit facility  all of which was available as of december  on march   we replaced our senior credit facility 
under this new facility  we obtained a million term loan  the proceeds of which were used to repay the balance on our existing term loan and for general business purposes  and a million revolving credit facility which will be used  in combination with cash on hand  to fund the purchase of wndy tv and wwho tv  during the first half of we are required to make mandatory payments on the new term loan of million per quarter beginning march  the term loan and revolving credit facility expire on march  and march   respectively

net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is the result of an increase in employees compensation and benefits of million  which is the result of million related to the sunrise acquisition  million related to the timing of salary and bonus payments and million due to a general market increase in the rates of compensation and benefits 
also contributing to the decrease in operating cash flow is an increase in cash paid for other operating expenses of million  which is primarily the result of the sunrise acquisition 
offsetting these was an increase in cash collected from customers of million  which was the result of improved collections on our accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the prior year 
this change was primarily the result of the liquidation of our short term investments during net cash provided by investing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year

table of contents the guarantee would require us to pay any shortfall after the assets of the joint venture were liquidated in the case of a default 
the cash flow generated by the joint venture has serviced the interest on the note and operational requirements of the joint venture since and has generated an average of million in cash distributions over the last three years 
we believe the fair value of the underlying assets of the joint venture is in excess of the carrying values of its assets or the gecc note 
the gecc note is not our obligation  but is recourse to the joint venture  our equity interests therein and to lin tv corp  pursuant to a guarantee 

table of contents factors that may affect future results risks associated with business activities our operating results are primarily dependent on advertising revenues and  as a result  we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns than businesses in other industries 
our operating results are primarily dependent on advertising revenues 
the success of our operations depends in part upon factors beyond our control  such as national and local economic conditions  the availability of high profile sporting events  the relative popularity of the programming on our stations  the demographic characteristics of our markets  and the activities of our competitors 
our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership or we may not achieve favorable ratings 
our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
a shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity  which could cause our advertising revenues to decline 
in addition  we  and those on whom we rely for programming  may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in viewer tastes and interests in the markets 
we are dependent to a significant degree on automotive advertising 
approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  consisted of automotive advertising 
a significant decrease in these revenues in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows  which could affect our ability to fund operations and service our debt obligations and affect the value of shares of our common stock 
we have a substantial amount of debt  which could adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  reduce our operating flexibility and put us at greater risk for default and acceleration of our debt 
as of december   we had approximately million of consolidated indebtedness and approximately million of consolidated stockholders equity 
in addition  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
accordingly  we will continue to have significant debt service obligations 
our large amount of indebtedness could  for example require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay indebtedness and reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate activities  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  expose us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rates on our senior credit facility vary  and impair our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general and place us at a disadvantage relative to our less leveraged competitors 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity and results of operations 
in addition  our debt instruments require us to comply with covenants  including those that restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations and make capital expenditures  that will restrict the manner in which we conduct our business and may impact our operating results 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default  which  if not cured or 
table of contents waived  would permit acceleration of our indebtedness and acceleration of indebtedness under other instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
in the past  we have obtained amendments with respect to compliance with financial ratio tests in our senior credit facility 
consents or amendments that may be required in the future may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
we have a history of net losses and a substantial accumulated deficit 
we had net losses of million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  primarily as a result of amortization and impairment of intangible assets and debt service obligations 
in addition  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
although we achieved net income of million in  we may not be able to maintain profitability in future periods 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations  forcing us to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  or to pay interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness  will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  will be subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  we may have to seek to restructure our remaining debt obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and the market  if any  for our debt 
we have a material amount of intangible assets  and if we are required to write down intangible assets in future periods  it would reduce net income  which in turn could materially and adversely affect the results of operations and the trading price of lin tv corp 
s class a common stock 
approximately billion  or  of our total assets as of december  consists of unamortized intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires  among other things  the impairment testing of goodwill 
if at any point in the future the value of these intangible assets decreased  we would be required to incur an impairment charge that could significantly adversely impact our reported results of operations and stockholders equity 
we recorded an impairment of our broadcast licenses at march  of million and at december  of million 
our strategy includes seeking growth through acquisitions of television stations  which could pose various risks and increase our leverage 
we intend to pursue selective acquisitions of television stations with the goal of improving their operating performance by applying our management s business and growth strategy 
however  we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets 
future acquisitions involve inherent risks  such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following any acquisitions 
we may not be able to successfully implement effective cost controls  increase advertising revenues or increase audience share with respect to any acquired station 
in addition  our future acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities and may result in the diversion of management s attention from the operation of our business 
in addition  television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest some television stations if a regulatory authority believes that a proposed acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations 

table of contents broadcast interests of our affiliates  including hicks muse  may be attributable to us and may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets  restricting our ability to execute our growth strategy 
the number of television stations we may acquire in any market is limited by fcc rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of individuals affiliated with us are attributable to those individuals under fcc rules 
the fcc generally applies its ownership limits to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association 
the broadcast or other media interests of our officers  directors and or greater voting stockholders are generally attributable to us  which may limit our acquisition or ownership of television stations in particular markets while those officers  directors or stockholders are associated with us 
in addition  the holder of an otherwise nonattributable equity or debt interest in a licensee which is in excess of of the total debt and equity of the licensee will nonetheless be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station  cable system or newspaper in the same market 
as of december   affiliates of hicks muse own  shares of lin tv class b common stock  which represents of lin tv s capital stock 
pursuant to fcc rules and regulations  non voting stock does not generally create an attributable interest 
as a result  due to the fact that affiliates of hicks muse only own shares of lin tv class b common stock  we believe that none of our stations will be attributed to hicks muse and that no stations attributed to hicks muse will be attributed to us 
however  if affiliates of hicks muse elect to convert their shares of class b common stock into either class a common stock or class c common stock of lin tv  under current fcc rules and regulations  the stations that are attributable to hicks muse would be attributed to us 
in addition  the fcc has stated that it reserves the authority  in an appropriate case  to declare as being attributable an unusual combination of otherwise nonattributable interests 
hicks muse and its affiliates  whose interests may differ from your interests  have approval rights with respect to significant transactions and could convert their equity interests in lin tv into a majority of its voting power  thereby reducing the voting power of other lin tv shareholders 
hicks muse and its affiliates have the ability to convert shares of lin tv s nonvoting class b common stock into class a common stock  subject to the approval of the fcc 
if this occurs  affiliates of hicks muse would own approximately of our voting equity interests in lin tv and will effectively have the ability to elect the entire board of directors and to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to lin tv shareholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
upon the conversion of the majority of the nonvoting class b common stock into class a common stock  the class c common stock will automatically convert into an equal number of shares of class a common stock 
the interests of hicks muse and its affiliates may differ from the interests of lin tv s other stockholders and hicks muse and its affiliates could take actions or make decisions that are not in your best interests 
for example  hicks muse is in the business of making significant investments in existing or newly formed companies and may from time to time acquire and hold controlling or non controlling interests in television broadcast assets  such as its existing investment in businesses like clear channel communications  inc  that may directly or indirectly compete with lin tv for advertising revenues 
hicks muse and its affiliates may from time to time identify  pursue and consummate acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast related businesses that may be complementary to lin tv s business and therefore such acquisition opportunities may not be available to lin tv 
moreover  royal w 
carson  iii and randall s 
fojtasek  two of lin tv s directors  together own all of lin tv s class c common stock and therefore possess of lin tv s combined voting power 
accordingly  messrs 
carson and fojtasek will have the power to elect the entire board of directors of lin tv and through this control  to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the lin tv stockholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
both of messrs

if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue could decline 
the entertainment industry  and particularly the television industry  is highly competitive and is undergoing a period of consolidation and significant change 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment  such as cable television  internet services  wireless cable  satellite to home distribution services  pay per view  digital video recorders  dvds and home video and entertainment systems  have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over the air television broadcast stations to new types of competition 
in addition  as a result of the telecommunications act of  the legislative ban on telephone cable ownership has been repealed and telephone companies are now permitted to seek fcc approval to provide video services to homes 
it will be difficult to take us over  which could adversely affect the trading price of our class a common stock 
affiliates of hicks muse effectively determine whether a change of control will occur because of their rights through their ownership of all of the shares of our class b common stock or through their voting power  if they convert their shares of class b common stock into class a common stock or class c common stock 
moreover  provision of delaware corporate law and our bylaws and certificate of incorporation  including the voting power rights of our class c common stock held by messrs 
carson and fojtasek  make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control would benefit the holders of class a common stock 
these provisions and controlling ownership by affiliates of hicks muse could also adversely affect the public trading price of our class a common stock 
the loss of network affiliation agreements or changes in network affiliations could materially and adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to quickly replace the network affiliation 
the non renewal or termination of a network affiliation agreement or a change in network affiliations could have a material adverse effect on us 
each of the networks generally provides our affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week 
in return  our stations broadcast network inserted commercials during that programming and often receive cash payments from networks  although in some circumstances  we make cash payments to networks 
in addition  some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances  including as a result of a change of control of our affiliated stations  which would generally result upon the acquisition of of our voting power 
in the event that affiliates of hicks muse elect to convert the shares of lin tv class b common stock held by them into shares of either class a common stock or class c common stock  such conversion may result in a change of control of our stations with network affiliation agreements 
some of the networks with which our stations are affiliated have required other broadcast groups  upon renewal of affiliation agreements  to reduce or eliminate network affiliation compensation and  in specific cases  to make cash payments to the network  and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements 
consequently  our affiliation agreements may not all remain in place and each network may not continue to provide programming or compensation to affiliates on the same basis as it currently provides programming or compensation 
if this occurs  we would need to find alternative sources of programming  which may be less attractive and more expensive 
we are currently in negotiations with nbc  fox and telefutura regarding affiliation agreements with their networks 
a change in network affiliation in a given television market may have many short term and long term consequences  depending upon the circumstances surrounding the change 
potential short term consequences include increased marketing costs and increased internal operating costs  which can vary widely depending on the amount of marketing required to educate the audience regarding the change and to maintain the station s viewing audience  short term loss of market share or slower market growth due to advertiser uncertainty about the switch  costs of gearing up a news operation  if necessary  and the cost of the equipment needed to conform the station s programming  equipment and logos to the new network affiliation 
long term consequences are more difficult to assess  due to the cyclical nature of each of the 
table of contents major network s share of the audience that changes from year to year with programs coming to the end of their production cycle and the audience acceptance of new programs in the future and the fact that national network averages are not necessarily indicative of how a network s programming is accepted in an individual market 
how well a particular network fares in the affiliation switch depends largely on the value of the broadcast license  which is influenced by the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting  whether it is a vhf or a uhf license  the quality and location of the license  the audience acceptance of the licensee s local news programming and community involvement and the quality of the other non network programming transmitted 
in addition  the majority of the revenue earned by television stations is attributable to locally produced news programming and syndicated product  rather than to network affiliation payments and advertising sales related to network programming 
the circumstances that may surround a network affiliation switch cause uncertainty as to the actual costs that will be incurred by us and  if these costs are significant  the switch could have a material adverse impact on the income we derive from the affected station 
the use of an alternative method of valuing our network affiliations could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 
different broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that are used by us 
these different assumptions may result in the use of different valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets among broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
the attributes include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market  the length of time that the broadcast license has been broadcasting  whether the station is a vhf station or a uhf station  the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within the market  the audience acceptance of the broadcast license s local news programming and community involvement  and the quality of non network programming carried by a station 
in connection with our purchase of sunrise television corp 
in may  we acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired in the sunrise transaction was based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in these specific markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to the television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in each market beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  these broadcasting companies look beyond the specific contract value and include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
other broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that vhf stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
if we were to adopt this alternative method for valuing these network affiliations  the value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill as reported on our balance sheet would be reduced and the value of our other intangibles assets 
table of contents would be proportionately increased 
as a result  our expenses relating to the depreciation and amortization of intangible assets could increase significantly as more value would be assigned to an amortizing asset and this increase could materially reduce our operating income and materially increase our net loss 
in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from the sunrise acquisition values due to different attributes of each station and the market in which it operates 
the general electric capital corporation note could result in significant liabilities and could trigger a change of control under our existing indebtedness  causing our indebtedness to become immediately due and payable 
general electric capital corporation gecc  a subsidiary of general electric company  provided debt financing for a joint venture between us and nbc universal  another subsidiary of general electric company  in the form of an million  non amortizing senior secured note due in the event that such note is not extended or otherwise refinanced when the note matures in  we expect that  assuming current federal marginal tax rates remain in effect  our tax liability related to the joint venture transaction will be approximately million 
the formation of the joint venture was intended to be tax free to us 
however  any early repayment of the note will accelerate this tax liability  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  if an event of default occurs under the note  and gecc is unable to collect all amounts owed to it after exhausting all commercially reasonable remedies against the joint venture  including during the pendency of any bankruptcy involving the joint venture  gecc may proceed against lin tv to collect any deficiency  including by foreclosing on our stock and other lin tv subsidiaries  which could trigger the change of control provisions under our existing indebtedness 
annual cash interest payments on the note are approximately million 
there are no scheduled payments of principal due prior to  the stated maturity of the note 
the obligations under the note were assumed by the joint venture  and the proceeds of the note were used to finance a portion of the cost of hicks muse s acquisition of us 
the note is not our obligation nor the obligation of any of lin tv s subsidiaries and is recourse only to the joint venture  our equity interest in the joint venture and  after exhausting all remedies against the assets of the joint venture and the other equity interest in the joint venture  to lin tv pursuant to a guarantee 
an event of default under the note will occur if the joint venture fails to make any scheduled payment of interest  within days of the date due and payable  or principal of the note on the maturity date 
the joint venture is required to maintain a cash reserve of million for the purpose of making interest and principal payments on the note when due in the event that the joint venture has insufficient cash on hand to make such payments 
both nbc and us have the right to make a shortfall loan to the joint venture to cover any interest payment 
however  if the joint venture fails to pay principal or interest on the note  and neither nbc nor us make a shortfall loan to cover the interest payment  an event of default would occur under the note and gecc could accelerate the maturity of the entire amount due under the note 
other than the acceleration of the principal amount of the note upon an event of default  prepayment of the principal of the note is prohibited prior to its stated maturity 
risks related to our industry any potential hostilities or terrorist attacks may affect our revenues and results of operations 
during each of the three month periods ended march  and june   we experienced a loss of advertising revenue and incurred additional broadcasting expenses due to the initiation of military action in iraq 
the military action disrupted our television stations regularly scheduled programming and some of our clients rescheduled or delayed advertising campaigns to avoid being associated with war coverage 
we expect that if the united states engages in other foreign hostilities or there is a terrorist attack against the united states  we may lose additional advertising revenue and incur increased broadcasting expenses due to further pre emption  delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns and the increased costs of providing coverage of such events 
we cannot predict the extent and duration of any future  disruption to our programming schedule  the amount of advertising revenue that would be lost or delayed or the amount by which our broadcasting expenses would increase as a result 
the loss of revenue and increased expenses has negatively affected  and could negatively affect in the future  our results of operations 

table of contents our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs  and increased programming costs could adversely affect our operating results 
our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs 
we may be exposed in the future to increased programming costs  which may adversely affect our operating results 
we often acquire program rights two or three years in advance  making it difficult for us to accurately predict how a program will perform 
in some instances  we may have to replace programs before their costs have been fully amortized  resulting in write offs that increase station operating costs 
changes in fcc ownership rules through commission action  judicial review or federal legislation may limit our ability to continue operating stations under local marketing agreements  may prevent us from obtaining ownership of the stations we currently operate under local marketing agreements and or may preclude us from obtaining the full economic value of one or more of our two station operations upon a sale  merger or other similar transaction transferring ownership of such station or stations 
fcc ownership rules currently impose significant limitations on the ability of broadcast licensees to have attributable interests in multiple media properties 
these restrictions include a rule prohibiting one company from owning broadcast television stations with service areas encompassing more than an aggregate share of national television households 
the restrictions also include a variety of local limits on media ownership 
the restrictions include an ownership limit of one television station in most medium and smaller television markets and two stations in most larger markets  known as the television duopoly rule 
the regulations also include a prohibition on the common ownership of a newspaper and television station in the same market newspaper television cross ownership  limits on common ownership of radio and television stations in the same market radio television station ownership and limits on radio ownership of four to eight radio stations in a local market 
in  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit found three of the fcc s decisions with respect to three of its ownership rules  including the then household limit on national television ownership  the television duopoly rule and a prohibition on ownership of television broadcast stations and cable systems in the same market to be arbitrary and capricious 
the court vacated the cable television cross ownership rule and remanded the national cap and television duopoly rule to the commission for further action 
in  the fcc voted substantially to amend many of its ownership rules 
the fcc raised the national television ownership limit from to 
the television duopoly rule was relaxed to permit ownership of up to three stations in certain large markets and two stations in many mid sized markets  provided that no more than one of the co owned stations was to be among the top four in audience share in the market 
in addition  the newspaper television cross ownership prohibition was restricted to smaller markets those with fewer than four television stations 
a new local cross ownership regulation was adopted which precluded ownership of certain combinations of television and radio stations and newspapers in markets with fewer than nine television stations 
with respect to the television duopoly rule  the commission declared that it would grant waivers of the top four restriction under certain circumstances 
it also held that two station combinations  which were not in conformance with the amended rule  eg  where both stations were among the top four stations in the local markets in audience share  would not have to be divested 
however  the commission also determined that a non conforming combination could not be transferred jointly either as a separate asset or through the transfer of control of the licensee  except by obtaining a waiver of the rule upon each transfer or by sale to certain eligible small business entities 
the commission also determined that it would continue to grandfather local marketing agreements entered into prior to november   such as our local marketing agreements in austin  texas  and providence  rhode island  until the conclusion of a further ownership review  which would address the question of whether and under what circumstances the agreements would be permitted to continue 
the amended rules were appealed to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit by multiple parties 
the third circuit stayed the effectiveness of the rules pending resolution of the appeal  a stay which remains in place 
on january   the national ownership cap was amended legislatively by congress fixing the cap at an aggregate reach of of national households 
on june   the third circuit ruled that the national cap legislation had mooted the appeal of the commission s amended rule 
the third circuit also ruled that the commission s decisions amending the television duopoly rule  the newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule  the radio television cross ownership rule and the local radio station ownership rule were for the most part arbitrary and capricious and remanded the rules to the fcc for further revision 

table of contents various parties supporting the fcc s actions  but not the fcc itself  have appealed the third circuit s decision to the united states supreme court  which is expected to decide sometime in the second quarter of whether to hear the appeal 
we are unable to predict whether the supreme court will decide to hear the appeal nor  if it does  what the outcome of its decision will be 
nor are we able to predict the timing or outcome of any fcc deliberations upon remand after the judicial appeals have been exhausted 
should the fcc s amended rules ultimately become effective  attractive opportunities may arise for additional television station and other media acquisitions 
but these changes also create additional competition for us from other entities  such as national broadcast networks  large station groups  newspaper chains and cable operators who may be better positioned to take advantage of such changes and benefit from the resulting operating synergies both nationally and in specific markets 
should the new television duopoly rule become effective  we may be able to acquire the ownership of one or both of the stations in austin  texas  and providence  rhode island  which we currently operate under local marketing agreements and which are subject to purchase option agreements entered into by our subsidiaries 
any such acquisition would be subject to the amended duopoly rule s restriction on ownership of more than one top four station in a market 
should we have to seek a waiver of the new rule in either case because the second station is among the top four in audience share  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining it 
should a waiver be required and obtained  or should we succeed in elevating to top four audience status the second station in any of the other markets in which we currently have two stations  we will be unable to transfer that two station combination  either through an asset transfer or a transfer of control of us or the applicable licensee subsidiary  without grant of another waiver or sale to an eligible small business entity 
moreover  should we be unable to obtain a waiver  there is no assurance that the grandfathering of our local marketing agreements will be permitted beyond conclusion of a future rulemaking which could be initiated as early as but no later than during the year ended december  we had net revenues of million  or  of our total net revenues  attributable to those local marketing agreements 
changes in technology may impact our long term success and ability to compete 
the fcc has adopted rules for implementing advanced television  commonly referred to as digital television  in the united states of america 
as of december   all of our stations were broadcasting in digital 
implementation of digital television improves the technical quality of over the air broadcast television 
however  conversion to digital operations may reduce a station s geographical coverage area 
we believe that digital television is essential to our long term viability and the broadcast industry  but we cannot predict the precise effect digital television might have on our business 
the fcc has levied fees on broadcasters with respect to non broadcast uses of digital channels  including data transmissions or subscriber services 
further advances in technology may also increase competition for household audiences and advertisers 
we are unable to predict the effect that technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or the future results of our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates principally with respect to our senior credit facility  which is priced based on certain variable interest rate alternatives 
there was approximately million outstanding as of december  under our senior credit facility 
accordingly  we are exposed to potential losses related to increases in interest rates 
a hypothetical percent increase in the floating rate used as the basis for the interest charged on the senior credit facility as of december  would result in an estimated million increase in annualized interest expense assuming a constant balance outstanding of million 
our exchangeable senior subordinated debentures have certain embedded derivative features that are required to be separately identified and recorded at fair value with a mark to market adjustment required each quarter 
the value of these features on issuance of the debentures was million and this amount was recorded as an original issue discount and is being accreted through interest expense over the period to may the derivative features are recorded at fair market value in the line item other liabilities 
we have recorded a gain on derivative instruments in connection with the mark to market of these derivative features of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents we are also exposed to market risk related to changes in the interest rates through our investing activities and our floating rate credit arrangements 
with respect to borrowings  our ability to finance future acquisition transactions may be impacted if we are unable to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates
