item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we research and develop biopharmaceutical products based on our patented dna delivery technologies for the prevention and treatment of serious or life threatening diseases 
in addition  we have gained access to enhancing technologies through licensing and collaborative agreements 
we believe the following areas of research offer the greatest potential for our product development efforts vaccines for use in high risk populations for infectious disease targets for which there are significant us needs  vaccines for general pediatric or adult populations for infectious disease applications  and cancer vaccines or immunotherapies which complement our existing programs and core expertise 
we plan to continue leveraging our patented technologies through licensing and collaborations 
we also plan to use our expertise  infrastructure  and financial strength to explore both in licensing and acquisition opportunities 
research  development and manufacturing programs to date  we have not received revenues from the sale of our independently developed pharmaceutical products 
we earn revenue by performing services under research and development contracts  grants  and manufacturing contracts  and from licensing access to our proprietary technologies 
since our inception  we estimate that we have received approximately million in revenue under these types of agreements 
revenues by source for each of the three years ended december   were as follows in millions source nih contracts iavi contract anthrax grants cmv grants other contracts and grants total contract and grant revenues invitrogen royalties sanofi aventis licenses corautus license merial license other royalties and licenses total royalty and license revenues total revenues see business product development dna vaccines for infectious diseases nih vaccine research center  international aids vaccine initiative  and collaboration and licensing agreements corporate collaborators outlicensing for a more detailed discussion of the various programs 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years  due primarily to the expansion of our research and development programs  the cost of preclinical studies and clinical trials  spending for outside services  costs related to maintaining our intellectual property portfolio  costs due to increased contract manufacturing activities  increased costs of our facilities  and possible advancement toward commercialization activities 

table of contents since our inception  we estimate that we have spent approximately million on research  development  manufacturing and production 
our current independent development focus is on novel dna vaccines for cmv as well as cancer immunotherapeutics allovectin and il ep 
from inception  we have spent approximately million on our allovectin program 
in  we completed a phase trial evaluating high dose  mg  allovectin 
we have successfully completed a spa with the fda for a phase trial of high dose allovectin that would be needed to support submission of a bla 
this and potential future trials would add to the time and cost of development 
additionally  we are in the early stages of clinical development of vaccine candidates for cmv 
product candidates from these programs and our il ep program for solid tumors will require significant additional costs to advance through development to commercialization 
from inception  we have spent approximately million on our cmv program  and approximately million on our il ep program 
we are in the early stages of clinical development of an anthrax vaccine candidate  however  due to the lack of additional government funding  we do not intend to pursue further development of our anthrax vaccine candidate at this time except for the ongoing non clinical development supported by an sbir grant 
see business product development cancer therapies for a more detailed explanation of the status of the allovectin and il ep programs 
see also business product development dna vaccines for infectious diseases for more detailed discussions of our cmv and anthrax vaccine programs 
research  development  manufacturing and production costs by major program  as well as other expenses for research and development and manufacturing  for each of the three years ended december   were as follows in millions program allovectin cmv anthrax il ep other research  development  manufacturing and production total research  development  manufacturing and production we have several other product candidates in the research stage 
it can take many years from the initial decision to screen product candidates  perform preclinical and safety studies  and perform clinical trials leading up to possible approval of a product by the fda or comparable foreign agencies 
the outcome of the research is unknown until each stage of the testing is completed  up through and including the registration clinical trials 
accordingly  we are unable to predict which potential product candidates we may proceed with  the time and cost to complete development  and ultimately whether we will have a product approved by the fda or comparable foreign agencies 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas intangible assets 
we capitalize the license fees we pay to acquire access to proprietary technologies if the technologies are expected to have alternative future use in multiple research and development projects 
the cost of licensed technology rights is amortized to using the straight line method over the estimated average useful 
table of contents life of the technology  which is generally ten years 
we also capitalize certain costs related to patent applications which have alternative future use in multiple research and development projects 
accumulated costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the patent  which is generally years and usually commences at the time the patent application is filed 
we review long lived assets for impairment at least annually  quarterly for intangible assets  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the total amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
if assets are to be disposed of  they are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell 
loss of legal ownership or rights to patents or licensed technologies  or significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  among other things  could give rise to asset impairment 
deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are recorded net of a valuation allowance 
this valuation allowance reduces the gross deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not realizable 
we considered projections of future taxable income  past operating results and tax planning strategies in making this determination 
clinical trial expenses 
we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and accruing this total cost for the patient over the estimated treatment period  which corresponds with the period over which the services are performed  beginning when the patient enrolls in the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to the trial site and other external expenses related to the conduct of the trial 
cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial  the method of administration of the treatment  and the number of treatments for each patient 
treatment periods vary depending on the clinical trial 
we make revisions to the clinical trial cost estimates as clinical trials progress 
clinical trial expense was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
accrued clinical trial costs were million at december  no material revisions to our previous clinical trial cost estimates were made in the periods presented 
accruals for potential disallowed costs on contracts 
we have contracts with agencies of the us government under which we bill for direct and indirect costs incurred 
these billed costs are subject to audit by government agencies  such as the nih 
we have established accruals of approximately million at december   to provide for potential disallowed costs 
in the event that the final costs allowed are different from what we have estimated  we adjust our estimated accrual  which could also affect our results of operations and cash flow 
no material adjustments were made to our previously estimated accruals in the periods presented 
revenue recognition we earn revenue by performing services under research and development contracts  grants  and manufacturing contracts  and from licensing our proprietary technologies 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determined  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue under research and development contracts  grants  and manufacturing contracts  except for fixed price contracts  is recognized as the research and development expenses for services performed are incurred  provided that all of the revenue recognition criteria noted above have been met 
revenue from milestones is recognized as agreed upon events representing the achievement of substantive steps in the development process are achieved  or the agreed upon passage of time occurs  and where the amount of the milestone payment approximates the value of achieving the milestone  and collection of payment is reasonably assured 
we do not recognize revenue on manufacturing contract change orders until the service is performed and we have a signed modification for additional funding for the contract 
prior to that time  any costs incurred for change orders on manufacturing contracts are deferred if it is highly probable that we will receive a signed modification 
otherwise  the costs are expensed as incurred 
once the signed modification for additional funding 
table of contents is received  the deferred costs and any related revenue are both recognized 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue 
we also have entered into fixed price manufacturing contracts under which the primary deliverables are investigational vaccines to be used for preclinical and clinical research 
under these contracts  revenue and related expenses are recognized when the product is shipped  provided all of the other revenue recognition criteria referred to above are met 
other revenues include amounts received from licensing our proprietary technologies  which occurs under a variety of circumstances including licenses  options and royalties 
any initial license or option payment received under a research and development services agreement is recognized as revenue over the term of the research and development period 
payments for options on a license to our technologies are recognized as revenue over the option period 
fees paid to extend an option are recognized as revenue over the option extension period 
upfront license payments are recognized as revenue upon contract signing if the fee is nonrefundable and noncreditable  and if there are no performance obligations remaining 
royalty revenue is recognized when earned and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in revenues from our contracts and grants were million in as compared to million in the increase in contract and grant revenue was due primarily to increased manufacturing contract shipments to the vrc under our nih agreement and increased funding under two niaid grants for our phase i cmv vaccine programs  partially offset by a reduction in shipments to the iavi 
license and royalty revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase in was primarily due to a million milestone we earned from centelion under our license agreement for certain cardiovascular applications of our core dna delivery technology as well as revenue we recognized from a new license with merial for cancer in companion animals 
license and royalty revenue for both periods included recognition of deferred license fees from corautus and royalty revenue from invitrogen 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase was primarily a result of the million accrual for settlement of the warf litigation in addition to personnel related expenses related to our expanded preclinical and clinical programs 
manufacturing and production expenses 
manufacturing and production expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to costs associated with our increased manufacturing capabilities within our new facility 
we moved to our new facility in  however  our manufacturing facilities were not fully functional until in addition  the increase was partially due to our expanded preclinical and clinical programs and an increase in manufacturing contract shipments in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to million of increased legal fees associated with the warf litigation  million of higher professional fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and severance expense of million related to the resignations of two officers during write down of investment 
in  we recorded a million write down of our investment in corautus shares received under a licensing agreement 
we subsequently reclassified these shares as a marketable security 

table of contents investment income 
investment income was million in as compared to million in investment income in included a million gain on the sale of corautus shares 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to increased capital lease obligations related to property and equipment expenditures 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in revenues from our contracts and grants increased to million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily related to increased manufacturing contract shipments to the vrc and iavi along with the recognition of million of grant revenue under an anthrax sbir grant 
license and royalty revenues in included the recognition of deferred license fees from corautus  a license payment from aqua health and royalty revenue 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million for from million for the decrease was due to lower clinical trial and personnel related costs 
manufacturing and production expenses 
manufacturing and production expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to costs associated with our increased manufacturing capabilities within our new facility and the increase in manufacturing contract shipments in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to lower personnel costs  including lower incentive based compensation expense  lower professional fees and lower facilities costs due to sublease loss accruals recorded in write down of investment 
in and  we recorded write downs of million and million  respectively  of our investment in corautus shares received under a licensing agreement 
investment income 
investment income was million in as compared to million in investment income was higher in primarily due to higher cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in interest expense 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to increased capital lease obligations related to property and equipment expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of preferred and common stock  public offerings of common stock  and revenues from collaborative agreements 
from our inception through december   we have received approximately million in revenues from performing services under research and development contracts  grants  and manufacturing contracts  and from licensing access to our proprietary technologies  and we have raised proceeds of approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million  compared with million at december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including restricted securities  totaled approximately million at december   compared with million at december  the declines in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in were due primarily to cash used to fund our operations  to purchase property and equipment  and to pay our long term debt obligations  partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock under our shelf registration statement 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the lower net cash used in as compared to reflects lower net losses  collections on accounts receivable and increases in accounts payables  offset by increases in deferred revenues 
the increase in cash used in as compared to included decreases in accounts payable  primarily related to construction payments  offset by higher collections on accounts receivable 
cash provided by investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  our net sales of marketable securities yielded million compared to million in and million in capital expenditures for included capital purchases for and improvements to  our new facility 
cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net proceeds from our registered direct stock offering in provided million of cash 
in  we entered into a new lease line with a leasing company and repaid amounts due under an existing capital lease 
in addition  the restricted cash requirements under the existing capital lease were significantly reduced as a result of our new lease line 
for  we have forecast a net loss of between million and million 
we expect that our total net cash used in may differ from our projected net loss principally because of timing of cash receipts on certain contract work 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses  manufacturing products and expenses  and general and administrative expenses  including continued increases in personnel costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical testing  outside services  facilities  intellectual property and possible commercialization costs 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  the impact of competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and possible commercialization activities and arrangements 
we may seek additional funding through research and development relationships with suitable potential corporate collaborators 
we may also seek additional funding through public or private financings 
in december  a shelf registration statement that we filed with the sec was declared effective  which allows us to issue from time to time an aggregate of up to million of common stock or preferred stock  of which approximately million was remaining as of december  we cannot assure that additional financing will be available on favorable terms or at all 
if additional funding is not available  we anticipate that our available cash and existing sources of funding will be adequate to satisfy our operating needs through at least contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations  including all off balance sheet arrangements  as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years after years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations warf settlement unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations certain long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet are not presented in this table because they are already reflected in operating lease commitments  or do not require cash settlement in the future 

table of contents in  we modified our equipment financing agreement to provide for an additional lease line of up to million through october   with interest rates ranging from to 
a portion of the lease line was used to repay outstanding debt of approximately million under another credit facility 
additional drawdowns will be used to finance equipment purchases 
the agreement requires a non interest bearing cash security deposit in the amount of of the amount of each drawdown 
financial covenants under the agreement include a requirement that we maintain specified levels of unrestricted cash and marketable securities 
in the event of default on this covenant  we would be required to provide an irrevocable letter of credit equal to of the then outstanding balance of amounts financed 
under the merck  sanofi pasteur  centelion  merial  corautus and aqua health agreements  we would be required to pay up to of certain initial upfront monetary payments  and a small percentage of some royalty payments  to the warf 
the cytrx and genetronics agreements would require us to make payments if we or our sublicensees advance products through clinical development 
for programs developed with the support of us government funding  the us government may have rights to resulting products without payment of royalties 
in addition  we have undertaken certain commitments under license agreements with collaborators  and under indemnification agreements with our officers and directors 
under the license agreements with our collaborators  we have agreed to continue to maintain and defend the patent rights licensed to the collaborators 
under the indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  we have agreed to indemnify those individuals for any expenses and liabilities in the event of a threatened  pending or actual investigation  lawsuit  or criminal or investigative proceeding 
as of december   we have employment agreements that contain severance arrangements with each of our three executive officers and two other executives 
under these agreements  we are obligated to pay severance if we terminate an executive officer s or other executive s employment without cause  or if an executive officer or other executive resigns for good reason  as defined in the agreements  within the periods set forth therein 
the severance would consist of continued payments at the current base compensation rate  or current base compensation rate plus the prior year s cash bonus in the case of the ceo  for the period specified in each agreement  which ranges from six to twelve months 
these agreements also specify that any earnings from employment or consulting during this period will offset any salary continuation payments due from us 
the maximum payments due under these employment agreements would have been million if each executive officer and other executive was terminated at december  recent accounting pronouncements for more information on the recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business  see note of the notes to our financial statements included herewith 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
our investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents  both restricted and non restricted  and marketable securities 
the average maturity of our non equity investments is approximately nine months 
our investments are classified as available for sale securities 
to assess our interest rate risk  we performed a sensitivity analysis projecting an ending fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities using the following assumptions a month time horizon  a month average maturity and a basis point increase in interest rates 
this pro forma fair value would have been million lower than the reported fair value of our non equity investments at december  at december   our unrealized gain on marketable securities was million 
we expect lower investment income in compared with due to lower investment balances 

table of contents the fair market value of floating interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of floating interest rate debt will vary as interest rates increase or decrease 
based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december   we believe that there were no material market risk exposures to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such date
