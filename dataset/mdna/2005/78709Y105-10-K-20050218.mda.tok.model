transfer  inc clark bros on a pro forma basis including clark bros 
in the prior year comparison  year over year revenue increased percent 
this revenue growth was primarily attributable to the company s improvement in yield revenue per hundred weight and growth in less than truckload ltl tonnage which management believes reflects market share gains due to various sales initiatives

on september   yellow corporation yellow completed a tax free distribution to its shareholders of percent of the outstanding common stock of scst the spin off 
our business is highly correlated to the industrial economy and is impacted by a number of other external factors including the price and availability of fuel  equipment  real estate and drivers  weather and government regulation 
the key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our networks  as measured by our average daily shipments and tonnage  the prices we obtain for our services  as measured by revenue per hundredweight yield and revenue per shipment  our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries  wages and benefits  purchased transportation  claims and insurance expense  fuel and maintenance  and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels

on a pro forma basis including clark bros 
in the prior year comparisons  ltl tonnage was up percent and ltl shipments were up percent 
yield improvement during the second half of is attributable to a better pricing environment that allowed saia to achieve better contract renewal rates with customers than in the past two years 
however  pricing remains competitive in regional markets 
management believes that saia continues to grow volume by providing high quality service for its customers and from sales initiatives in specific market segments 
approximately percent of saia s revenue is subject to individual customer price adjustment negotiations that occur intermittently throughout the year 
the remaining percent of revenue is subject to the annual general rate increase

operating income in also includes million in integration charges at saia related to the clark bros 
acquisition and million in charges at jevic to reflect actuarially estimated increases in the workers compensation liability related to claims in prior years 
operating income in benefited from net operating gains of million from the sale of revenue equipment and gains of million from the sale of one real estate facility 
the operating ratio operating expenses divided by operating revenue was compared to in excluding the integration charges  workers compensation charges and property gains described above  the consolidated operating ratio in was in february saia acquired clark bros  a midwestern less than truckload operation serving states 
during the first half of the year  saia recorded million in charges related to the may integration of this company into saia

also in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter jevic recorded million in higher than anticipated workers compensation expense based on the results of an actuarial valuation of their workers compensation liability completed in the fourth quarter approximately million related to increases in the liability for claims from prior years and the remaining million represented an increase in estimated claims expense 
both saia and jevic continued initiatives to improve productivity and control variable costs as monthly volumes fluctuated 
these costs and productivity initiatives were partially offset by structural cost increases in wage rates  purchased transportation  healthcare costs and other operating expenses 
higher fuel prices exclusive of taxes  in conjunction with volume changes  caused million of the increase in operating expenses and supplies 
these fuel price increases were more than offset by increased revenues from the fuel surcharge program 
saia had operating income of million in  compared to million in the operating ratio at saia was in compared to in saia s operating ratio was excluding the million integration charge in saia improved its operating income through yield improvement  increased volume due in part to the clark bros 
acquisition and continued strong cost controls

however  in  jevic s service execution was not as consistent  in part due to a number of external factors including changes in hours of service regulations  which hurt both productivity and profitability

holding costs in reflected million in higher professional fees related to the company s compliance with requirements under the sarbanes oxley act 
other substantially all scst nonoperating expenses represent interest expense 
the percent increase in interest cost is a result of the million seller note issued in connection with the company s february acquisition of clark bros 
and a million increase in letters of credit 
the company s capital structure consists predominantly of longer term  fixed rate instruments 
the consolidated effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the effective tax rate included approximately million in tax benefit related to the favorable settlement of various tax issues 
the effective tax rate was lower due to the tax benefit for previously unrecognized state operating loss carryforwards of million  due to changes in state tax laws enacted in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provide an analysis of the income tax provision and the effective tax rate 
working capital capital expenditures the decrease in working capital is predominantly the result of lower year over year invested cash balances resulting from capital expenditures which included the february clark bros 
acquisition and higher accounts payable and year end wage and benefit accruals partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
the increase in accounts receivable reflects the higher revenues in december versus december the net capital investments include million for the february acquisition of clark bros  approximately million investment in real estate and million for replacement of revenue equipment and investment in technology equipment and software 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenue and volume the percent increase in consolidated revenue to million was the result of volume increases in both shipments and ltl tonnage while year over year yield was relatively flat  as pricing remains very competitive

saia s operating revenue excluding fuel surcharge was million in  up percent from million in saia ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge a measure of yield increased percent to per hundredweight for  while ltl tonnage was up percent to million tons and ltl shipments were up percent to million shipments 
the flat yield is a combination of freight mix and competitive pricing pressure in regional markets

operating expenses and margin the percent increase in consolidated operating income reflects higher margin contribution on year over year volume increases and cost and productivity improvements partially offset by structural cost increases 
the operating ratio operating expenses divided by operating revenue was compared to in both saia and jevic continued initiatives to improve productivity and control variable costs as monthly volumes fluctuated 
these costs and productivity initiatives were partially offset by structural cost increases in wage rates  healthcare costs  casualty insurance premiums and other operating expenses 
higher fuel prices exclusive of taxes  in conjunction with volume changes  caused million of the increase in operating expenses and supplies 
these fuel price increases were more than offset by increased revenues from the fuel surcharge program 
saia had operating income of million in  compared to million in the operating ratio at saia was in compared to in despite the relatively flat yield discussed above  saia improved its operating income through continued strong cost controls and productivity initiatives that improved performance metrics in pickup and delivery  linehaul and dock areas of the company 
these improvements in labor productivity  safety initiatives and other expense reductions offset higher healthcare costs  a general wage increase in august and other wage adjustments during the year 
as of the end of  saia s wage rates were percent higher than the end of saia s overall increase in wage expense was partially offset by a decrease in purchased transportation  as saia more efficiently utilized purchased transportation in meeting its peak capacity needs 
jevic operating income was million in  up from million in jevic s revenue and yield improvement offset structural cost increases in the operating ratio at jevic was in compared to in jevic reduced its frequency rate for workers compensation claims in workers compensation expense in included million higher than anticipated costs relating to unfavorable development in the severity of open claims and the implementation of a more conservative  actuarial estimate for establishing workers compensation reserves 
this level of profitability was obtained despite a percent average wage increase over jevic increased its use of purchased transportation to fill peak capacity needs during versus the prior year  principally due to operational challenges related to a continuing shortage of drivers throughout the year 
holding company operating expenses for were million in excess of costs allocated to the operating companies 
these holding company costs included a million charge related to the appreciation of scst stock accounted for in the capital accumulation plan  a million charge for the estimated payout of our long term incentive plan related to the appreciation of scst stock  million related to reserve increases on older casualty claims and million for a consulting project 
these older casualty claims were incurred prior to our september spin off  and had been subject to a deductible buy down program with our former parent 
the increase in reserves was appropriate to estimate the increased severity potential of these claims 
the holding company had million in operating expenses in excess of costs allocated to the operating companies in  which was not indicative of post spin off operations 

table of contents other substantially all scst nonoperating expenses represent interest expense 
the increase in interest cost is a result of the company s post spin off capital structure consisting of predominantly longer term  higher fixed rate instruments versus the principally shorter term floating rate structure with the former parent company 
the consolidated effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the tax benefit for previously unrecognized state operating loss carryforwards of million  due to changes in state tax laws enacted in  together with the reduced impact of nondeductible business expenses on higher income before income taxes 
the results include a charge of million recorded in the first quarter of from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements provide an analysis of the income tax provision and the effective tax rate and additional discussion on the charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill 
working capital capital expenditures the change in working capital is predominantly the result of a higher invested cash balance and increases in accounts receivable  due to higher revenues in december versus december  offset by increases in wage and employee benefits accruals  primarily related to increased accruals for profit sharing and vacation 
restrictions on prepayment of long term fixed rate debt resulted in a higher cash and cash equivalent balance from operations in the capital investments primarily represent replacement of revenue equipment and investment in technology equipment and software 
outlook in we achieved both revenue growth and profitability improvement  while positioning our company for future growth potential 
the february acquisition of clark bros 
expanded saia s geography from to states and provides opportunities for greater density within their network in both the old and new saia territories 
also in  both saia and jevic capitalized on the stronger economy and improved pricing and yield management 
our business remains highly correlated to the general economy  and in particular industrial production 
for  we anticipate improved profitability due to anticipated favorable economic conditions on continued growth in our existing geography and subsidiary specific profit improvement initiatives 
these initiatives include yield improvement  gains in cost management  productivity and asset utilization that collectively will help offset anticipated structural cost increases in wages  healthcare costs and other expense categories 
our priorities in have not changed from and include a continued focus on providing top quality service  improving safety performance and investing in management and infrastructure for future growth and profitability improvement 
actual results for will depend upon a number of factors  including the continued strength of the economy  our ability to match capacity with shifting volume levels  competitive pricing pressures  cost and availability of drivers and purchased transportation  insurance claims and regulatory changes 
see forward looking statements for a more complete discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
financial condition scst liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in new equipment  land and structures and information technology  as well as funding working capital requirements 
in connection with the spin off  scst issued million in senior notes under a million master shelf agreement with prudential investment management  inc and certain of its affiliates 
scst also entered into a million amended november to million and in january to million agented revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of oklahoma  na  as agent 
proceeds from the senior notes and a portion of the credit agreement were used for payments due yellow discussed below 
scst had approximately million outstanding under line of credit agreements with yellow immediately prior to the spin off  of which 
table of contents million was repaid to yellow under the terms of the spin off 
the remaining million reduction in the line of credit with yellow was a capital contribution to scst from yellow 
the company s long term debt at december  includes million in senior notes that are unsecured with a fixed interest rate of percent and an average maturity of eight years 
payments due under the senior notes are interest only until june  and at that time semi annual principal payments begin  with the final payment due december under the terms of the senior notes  scst must maintain several financial covenants including a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ebitdar  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth  among others 
at december   scst was in compliance with these covenants 
in addition  scst has third party borrowings of approximately million in subordinated notes and million in seller notes 
on january   the credit agreement was amended to increase availability from million to million to increase the company s capacity for letters of credit in support of self insured retentions for casualty and workers compensation claims and achieve greater flexibility for potential future acquisitions 
the amended million credit agreement is unsecured with an interest rate based on libor or prime at the company s option  plus an applicable spread  in certain instances  and matures in january at december   scst had no borrowings under the credit agreement  million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement and availability of million 
the available portion of the credit agreement may be used for future capital expenditures  working capital and letter of credit requirements as needed 
under the terms of the credit agreement  scst must maintain several financial covenants including a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to ebitdar  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth  among others 
at december   scst was in compliance with these covenants 
at december  yellow provided guarantees on behalf of scst primarily for open workers compensation claims and casualty claims incurred prior to march  under the master separation and distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spin off  scst pays yellow s actual cost of any collateral it provides to insurance underwriters in support of these claims through october after which time it is cost plus basis points through october at december   the portion of collateral allocated by yellow to scst in support of these claims was million 
projected net capital expenditures for are approximately million plus up to an additional million for several strategic real estate opportunities within saia s existing network 
including these capital expenditures for real estate in  this represents an approximately million increase from net capital expenditures for property and equipment 
approximately million of the capital budget was committed at december  net capital expenditures pertain primarily to replacement of revenue equipment at both subsidiaries and additional investments in information technology  land and structures 
the company has historically generated cash flows from operations that have funded its capital expenditure requirements 
cash flows from operations were million for the year ended december   which were million less than net capital expenditures for acquisition of property and equipment 
the timing of capital expenditures can largely be managed around the seasonal working capital requirements of the company 
in addition  the february  acquisition of clark bros 
utilized approximately million in cash and increased outstanding indebtedness by million 
however  the company has adequate sources of capital to meet short term liquidity needs through its cash million at december  and availability under its revolving credit facility million at december  and increased by million on january  
in addition to these sources of liquidity  the company has million under its long term debt facilities  which is available to fund other longer term strategic investments 
the february  acquisition of clark bros 
transfer  inc utilized approximately million in cash 
future operating cash flows are primarily dependent upon the company s profitability and its ability to manage its working capital requirements  primarily accounts receivable  accounts payable and wage and benefit accruals 
the company has the ability to adjust its capital expenditures in the event of a shortfall in anticipated operating cash flows 
the company believes its current capital structure and availability under its borrowing facilities along with anticipated cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to fund planned replacements of revenue equipment and investments in technology 
additional sources of capital may be needed to fund future long term strategic growth initiatives

acquisition total in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k  and in contractual cash obligations table below 
in addition to the principal amounts disclosed in the tables below  the company has interest obligations of approximately million for and decreasing for each year thereafter  based on borrowings outstanding at december  contractual cash obligations the following tables set forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in millions payments due by year thereafter total contractual cash obligations long term debt obligations revolving line of credit long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in this form k

amount of commitment expiration by year thereafter total other commercial commitments available line of credit letters of credit surety bonds total commercial commitments critical accounting policies and estimates scst makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements that affect reported amounts and disclosures therein 
in the opinion of management  the accounting policies that generally have the most significant impact on the financial position and results of operations of scst include claims and insurance accruals 
scst has self insured retention limits generally ranging from  to  per claim for medical  workers compensation  auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
for only 
table of contents the policy year march through february  the company has an aggregate exposure limited to an additional  above its  per claim deductible under its auto liability program 
the liabilities associated with the risk retained by scst are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis  demographics  nature and severity  past experience and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation claims and with respect to all other liabilities  estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience 
however  these estimated accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of scst differ from these assumptions 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
revenue recognition and related allowances 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis for shipments in transit while expenses are recognized as incurred 
in addition  estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable include estimates of shipments in transit and estimates of future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectibility 
revenue is recognized in a systematic process whereby estimates of shipments in transit are based upon actual shipments picked up  scheduled day of delivery and current trend in average rates charged to customers 
since the cycle for pick up and delivery of shipments is generally days  typically less than percent of a total month s revenue is in transit at the end of any month 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are based upon historical experience of credit losses  adjustments processed and trends of collections 
billing adjustments are primarily made for discounts and billing corrections 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated  however  changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and other factors can significantly impact these estimates 
depreciation and capitalization of assets 
under the scst accounting policy for property and equipment  management establishes appropriate depreciable lives and salvage values for scst s revenue equipment tractors and trailers based on their estimated useful lives and estimated fair values to be received when the equipment is sold or traded in 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated when circumstances warrant 
however  actual depreciation and salvage values could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
recovery of goodwill 
in connection with its acquisition in  scst allocated purchase price based on independent appraisals of intangible assets and real property and management s estimates of valuations of other tangible assets 
annually  scst assesses goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
this fair value based test involves assumptions regarding the long term future performance of the operating subsidiaries of scst  fair value of the assets and liabilities of scst  cost of capital rates and other assumptions 
however  actual recovery of remaining goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
in the event remaining goodwill is determined to be impaired a charge to earnings would be required 
equity based incentive compensation 
the company maintains long term incentive compensation arrangements that have three year performance periods 
the criteria for awards are scst s total shareholder return versus a peer group of companies over the performance period 
the company accrues for plan expenses based on performance criteria from the beginning of the performance period through the reporting date 
this results in the potential for significant adjustments from period to period that cannot be predicted 
these accounting policies  and others  are described in further detail in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk scst is exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of interest rates and fuel prices 
the detail of scst s debt structure is more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
to mitigate our risk to rising fuel prices  saia and jevic each have implemented fuel surcharge programs 
these programs are well established within the industry and customer acceptance of fuel surcharges remains high 
since the amount of fuel surcharge is based on average national diesel fuel prices and is reset weekly  exposure of scst to fuel price volatility is significantly reduced
