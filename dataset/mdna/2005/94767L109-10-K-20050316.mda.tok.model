the webex mediatone network includes a distributed network made up of dispersed communications switches  switching centers and dedicated network links designed to reduce latency issues and service interruptions even when participants are located in different countries  a network designed to be redundant  meaning that it is designed to detect equipment failures that might occur along the network that would cause a network outage and to remedy such failures by transferring network operations to alternate  functioning equipment located elsewhere on the network  webex proprietary switches in data centers located in the us  europe and asia  in our own facilities and at third party co location facilities  high capacity internet connections for high speed connectivity and redundancy

customers and distribution partners we sell our services directly to our customers and indirectly through our distribution partners 
we offer our services on a monthly subscription basis to our customers and through a revenue sharing  discounted or pay per use basis through our distribution partners 
our customers purchase and use our services themselves while our distribution partners integrate and resell our services with their offerings 
some of our distribution partners are also end user customers 
as of december   we had subscription agreements with approximately  direct customers 
in  we derived approximately of our revenue from direct sales to customers 
typically  our direct sales contracts are for an initial non cancelable term ranging from three to twelve months  and then automatically renew for some period unless terminated by either party 
as of december   we had agreements in place with approximately distribution partners  including portals  software and service vendors and communications service providers 
in  we generated approximately of our revenue from these relationships 
software and service vendors have agreements to resell our services to end users by marketing  and in some cases integrating  our services into their product or service offerings 
communications service providers typically resell our services in conjunction with their teleconferencing services 
our distribution agreements typically have terms of one to three years and are automatically renewed for additional one year terms unless either party terminates the agreement with days prior written notice 
in most of these agreements  the distribution partner purchases subscription or pay per use services from us and resells such services to end user customers 
under these agreements  the amount of revenue we receive depends on the level of commitment and volume of business generated under the agreement 
under our distribution agreements  either we or the distribution partner bills the end user customers 
when we bill the end user  a percentage of the proceeds generated from the distribution partner s sale of our services is paid to the distribution partner and the remainder is retained by us 
when the distribution partner bills the end user  we sell the services on a discounted basis to the distribution partner  which in turn marks up the price and sells the services to the end user 
the latter is the predominant method in use with our distribution partners 
in  sales of our meeting center service  whether directly to our customers or indirectly through our distribution partners  accounted for approximately of our revenue 
in and  respectively  sales of our meeting center service accounted for and of our revenue 
this reduction in meeting center sales as a percentage of our total revenue may continue as we introduce new service offerings and increase revenue in other existing services 

k third party software and hardware we license software and purchase hardware  such as database  operating system  and web server software  font technology and servers  routers  and audio conference bridges 
we believe that use of third party vendors enables us to integrate current and emerging technologies into our proprietary service offerings 
we purchase  or license  these third party technologies from companies including bea systems application servers  bitstream font technology  oracle database technology  rackable servers  sun microsystems servers  veritas file management  pactolus audio conference bridge technology  sonus audio conference bridge technology  and convidia audio conference bridge technology 
while the loss of one or more of these vendors may result in the need to identify  secure and integrate alternative technologies  we believe we can obtain  from other sources and on comparable business terms  third party software or hardware functionally comparable to that provided by these third party vendors 
research and development the emerging market for web communications services is characterized by rapid technological change  new product introductions and enhancements  evolving customer requirements and rapidly changing industry standards 
we devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing and enhancing our network services and application platform  extending our global network  and conducting quality assurance testing 
as of december   we had employees engaged in research and development activities 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to devote significant resources to research and development for the foreseeable future 
a significant amount of our development and testing activity is conducted by our subsidiary in china webex china 
as of december   of the employees in our webex china operations  employees were engaged in research and development activities 
we rely on webex china for a significant portion of our quality assurance  software development and other activities 
sales and marketing our sales efforts target a broad range of businesses  government agencies and non profit organizations primarily through direct sales channels and  to a lesser extent  through indirect sales channels 
direct sales are generated through our internal sales force  while indirect sales are generated through agreements with our distribution partners 
our internal sales force uses our own webex services to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of our direct sales channel 
as of december   we had employees engaged in sales and marketing activities 
our sales and marketing expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to devote significant resources to sales and marketing for the foreseeable future 
we derive sales revenues from both us based and non us based customers 
in  and  the percentage of revenues from u 
s customers was   and  respectively 
in  and  the percentage of revenues from our non us customers was   and  respectively 
our marketing programs include customer needs assessment and market analysis  service and platform marketing  brand awareness  advertising  public relations  lead generation  and educating organizations in our target markets 
competition the web communications services market is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and is significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies with respect to specific elements of our web communications services 
for example  we compete with providers of traditional communications technologies such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  applications software and tools companies  and web conferencing services such as centra software  cisco systems  citrix systems  genesys  ibm  macromedia  microsoft  oracle and raindance 
competition from microsoft for the general web conferencing market  or from other vendors specifically targeted at the low end market  may adversely affect us 
microsoft has become a more active participant in this web communications services market since its acquisition of our competitor placeware in microsoft has a current product offering which is competitive with ours and which is called microsoft office live meeting 
microsoft office live meeting is being marketed together with other microsoft software products and services under the name microsoft office system 
if microsoft chose to deploy greater resources toward the marketing of the live meeting service  microsoft could become a more significant competitor in the web communications market in which we operate 
microsoft may attempt to leverage its dominant market position in the operating system  productivity application or browser markets  through technical integration or bundled offerings  to expand its presence in the web communications market  which could make it difficult for other 
k vendors of web communications products and services  such as webex  to compete 
in addition  some competitors offer web communications products and services targeted at customers who are more price conscious and are less concerned about functionality  scalability  integration and security features 
such offerings may make it more difficult for us to compete in that segment of the market and may cause some of our existing customers to switch to these competitors 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include service functionality  quality and performance  ease of use  reliability  scalability and security of services  customer service and support  establishment of a significant base of customers and distribution partners  ability to introduce new services to the market in a timely manner  ability to integrate with third party offerings and services  and pricing 
although we believe our services compete favorably with respect to many of these factors  the market for our services is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with greater resources such as ibm  microsoft and cisco 
intellectual property the status of united states patent protection in the internet industry is not well defined and will evolve as the us patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
we currently have issued patents in a number of areas including peer to peer connections to facilitate conferencing  document annotation  optimizing data transfer  graphical user interface for extracting video presentations and remote collaboration systems involving multiple computers  and we currently have over patent applications pending in the united states 
eight of the issued patents we acquired in connection with our june acquisition of certain assets of presenter  inc and five we purchased in from ncr corporation 
we may seek additional patents in the future 
we do not know if our patent applications or any future patent application will result in any patents being issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if such patents are issued at all 
we do not know whether any patents we have received or may receive will be challenged  invalidated or be of any value 
it is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states  and our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours 
we will continue to seek patent and other intellectual property protections  when appropriate  for those aspects of our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages 
the pending  and any future  patent applications may not result in the issuance of valid patents 
our success depends in part upon our rights to proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret  trademark and contractual protection to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we require our employees  to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements upon commencement of employment 
before we will disclose any confidential aspects of our services  technology or business plans to customers  potential business partners and other non employees  we routinely require such persons to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements 
in addition  we require all employees  and those consultants involved in the deployment of our services  to agree to assign to us any proprietary information  inventions or other intellectual property they generate  or come to possess  while employed by us 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services or technology 
these precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
when we become aware of such infringement  we may take action including bringing legal action against such parties 
in addition  we may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
we may be unaware of filed patent applications which have not yet been made public and which relate to our services 
from time to time  we have received notices alleging that we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 
in such cases  we investigate the relevant facts  respond to the allegations and  where case facts and other conditions warrant  consider settlement options 
intellectual property claims may be asserted against us in the future 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
intellectual property litigation could also require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business

k revenue and cash generation models 
we sell our services directly to customers  which both in the fourth quarter of and for the full year accounted for approximately of our revenue  or million and million  respectively 
we also sell our services indirectly to customers through those of our distribution partners that buy and resell our services  which sales both in the fourth quarter of and for the full year accounted for approximately of our revenue  or million and million  respectively 
with these types of distribution partners  whom we also generally refer to as resellers  we sell to and contract directly with the distribution partner  and revenue is recognized based on net amounts charged to the distribution partner 
we also have another type of distribution partner a distribution partner that acts as our sales or referral agent 
when a sale is made from us to a customer through the efforts of this kind of distribution partner  the distribution partner receives from us a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of webex services to the customer  and we include the revenue received by us within the broad category of revenue received from services sold directly to customers 
we enter into distribution relationships  either reseller or referral agent  so that we can increase total revenue by obtaining customers that we could not obtain through our direct sales efforts 
historically  revenue has been generated based on a monthly  fixed fee subscription pricing model 
a customer may subscribe to a certain number of concurrent user ports per month  which would enable the customer to have that set number of users connected to webex meetings at any one time  or to a minimum minutes commitment  which would enable the customer to have up to a set number of total minutes within the month to utilize our services 
another of our fixed fee offerings is the named host offering  in which a certain named individual may host meetings at which up to a certain number of attendees may participate 
we refer to the revenue associated with these monthly  fixed fee subscription arrangements  measured as of the end of any month  as committed revenue 
in addition  there are several situations in which customers are charged per minute or usage based pricing 
these include customer overage fees for port customers  usage of minutes in excess of the minimum commitment  most types of telephony charges  certain distribution partner arrangements and individual pay per use services purchased directly from our website 
overage fees are charged when a customer subscribing to a set number of ports uses more than the subscribed number of ports in one or more web conference sessions 
per minute fees are assessed when a customer on a minutes pricing model uses more than its monthly commitment 
per minute telephone revenue comes when a customer in a web conference session elects to have us set up and run the audio portion of the conference  rather than the customer conducting its telephone usage independently of us 
a majority of revenue received from our telecommunications partner arrangements is usage  or per minute  based 
finally  when a customer wants to use our services on a one time basis by visiting our website  purchasing the service and paying online by credit card  the pricing is per minute or usage based  except in instances where the online customer instead purchases a one month subscription for a fixed fee 
we refer to the revenue derived from this per minute or usage based pricing model  measured as of the end of any month  as uncommitted revenue 
uncommitted revenue is increasing as a percentage of our total revenue 
market opportunities  related challenges and our responses 
we believe the market for web conferencing services to be healthy and growing 
various published articles have cited several trends underlying this projected market increase 
one trend is the desire of many companies to achieve cost savings in the areas of information technology  or it  spending and employee travel 
in light of increased it budget constraints reportedly faced by many companies  we believe a cost saving decision is to hire an external web conferencing vendor to meet a company s web conferencing needs  rather than undertaking the capital and personnel spending necessary to construct and maintain an internal company web conferencing network 
additionally  companies may perceive that web conferencing usage can reduce costs to the extent that web conferencing displaces the need for individuals within companies to travel in order to conduct business  conduct training or participate in large attendee events 
another trend favoring the projected growth of the web conferencing market is the relative infancy of the web conferencing market 
the adoption of web conferencing may follow a pattern similar to that which has been observed with other computer related technologies 
according to this pattern  the first users can be grouped into a category called early adopters a relatively small percentage of potential users who first discover and are able to understand and make use of a new technology 
if the product seems useful  a second wave of users may arise which is often many times larger than the number of early adopters 
in the usual case  this larger number of users materializes because of workplace usefulness employers start to understand the utility of the technology in the workplace and encourage or require employee usage of the technology 
eventually  if the utility of the technology is compelling enough  the technology may become a staple of most workplaces and the technology is deemed mainstream 
under this adoption pattern  the greatest growth in the market occurs during this migration from second wave to mainstream usage 
one such example of this adoption pattern is usage of the desktop computer during the s 
another example is usage of word processing software associated with the desktop computer during the s 
in each instance  time required to migrate from the early adoption phase to the mainstream phase exceeded ten years 

k with some technologies  the adoption pattern described above does not materialize fully 
if a technology has experienced early adopter or second wave usage but then proves not as useful as first believed or touted  or if an alternative technology emerges  that technology may never progress to mainstream use 
we believe that  at present  web conferencing appears to be in either a very late early adopter or an early second wave phase 
usage of the technology has penetrated many worldwide corporations  but with many of these customers  this penetration is in only one or a few divisions or departments of the corporation and thus the percentage of employee users is still fairly low 
so  there may remain ahead for web conferencing the critical transition period from second wave to mainstream adoption  where we believe the annual rate of growth of usage would exceed previous rates of growth 
however  there can be no assurance that web conferencing will progress to mainstream use  and in fact usage of web conferencing could regress 
there exist a number of challenges to the projected market growth scenario for web conferencing 
one is a concern  actual or perceived  about security 
as the universe of corporate activities that can be conducted in a web conference expands  more and more of these activities will embrace sensitive corporate or government financial data  plans  projects or other proprietary information 
if web conferencing technologies do not have embedded within them adequate security protections so that the contents of a web conference will remain private among the participants  usage may not grow as projected 
moreover  to the extent that there occur publicized incidents of security breaches associated with usage of a web conferencing technology  no matter who the vendor  the security related concerns of would be users of the technology likely will be increased and this could dampen market growth 
we have assigned a high priority  in the design and implementation of our webex mediatone network  to these security issues 
another challenge to broad adoption of web conferencing services is general acceptance of this mode of communication as a normal part of business activity 
individuals may not feel comfortable using the technology  or they may prefer traditional means of communicating such as the telephone or face to face meetings 
broad adoption of web conferencing will require users to incorporate the use of this technology as part of their normal business activity 
industry wide factors relevant to us 
the web communications services market is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and is significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies in regards to specific elements of our web communications services 
for example  we compete with providers of traditional communications technologies such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  applications software and tools companies  and web conferencing services such as centra software  cisco systems  citrix systems  genesys  raindance  ibm  oracle  macromedia  and microsoft 
competition from microsoft for the general web conferencing market  or from other vendors specifically targeted at the low end market  may adversely affect us 
microsoft has become a more active participant in this web communications services market since its acquisition of our competitor placeware in microsoft has a current product offering which is competitive with ours and which is called microsoft office live meeting 
microsoft office live meeting is being marketed together with other microsoft software products and services under the name microsoft office system 
if microsoft chose to deploy greater resources toward the marketing of the live meeting service  microsoft could become a more significant competitor in the web communications market in which we operate 
microsoft may attempt to leverage its dominant market position in the operating system  productivity application or browser markets  through technical integration or bundled offerings  to expand its presence in the web communications market  which could make it difficult for other vendors of web communications products and services  such as webex  to compete 
in addition some competitors offer web communications products and services targeted at customers who are more price conscious and are less concerned about functionality  scalability  integration and security features 
such offerings may make it more difficult for webex to compete in that segment of the market and may cause some of our existing customers to switch to these competitors 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that there are a number of accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  sales reserves  the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes and goodwill and intangible assets 
the policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
revenue recognition 
revenue is derived from the sale of web communications services 
web communications services revenue is generated through a variety of contractual arrangements directly with customers and with distribution partners  who in turn sell the services to customers 
the company sells web communications services directly to customers through service subscriptions and pay per use arrangements 
under these arrangements  customers access the application hosted on webex servers using a standard web browser 
subscription arrangements include monthly subscriber user fees and user set up fees 
the subscription arrangements are considered service arrangements in accordance with eitf 
k issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  and with multiple deliverables under eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which became effective during under eitf  all deliverables are considered one unit of accounting  therefore  committed revenue is recognized ratably over the current term of the contract and variable usage based fees are recognized as usage occurs 
during the initial term  the company provides training services  web page design and set up services 
in addition to subscription services revenue  webex derives revenue from pay per use services and telephony charges that are recognized as the related services are provided 
we also enter into reselling arrangements with certain distribution partners  which purchase and resell our services on a revenue sharing  discounted or pay per use basis 
revenue under these arrangements is derived from our services provided to end users and is recognized over the service period provided that evidence of the arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
initial set up fees received in connection with these arrangements are recognized ratably over the initial term of the contract 
during the initial term  we provide training services  web page design and set up services 
service fees are recognized as the services are provided for pay per use service arrangements and ratably over the service period for services provided on a subscription basis through the reseller 
our reseller arrangements may require guaranteed minimum revenue commitments that are billed in advance to the reseller 
advance payments received from reseller distribution partners are deferred until the related services are provided or until otherwise earned by us 
we contract directly with distribution partners who are resellers  and revenue is recognized based on net amounts charged to the distribution partner 
persuasive evidence for all of our arrangements is represented by a signed contract 
the fee is considered fixed or determinable if it is not subject to refund or adjustment 
collectibility of guaranteed minimum revenue commitments by resellers is not reasonably assured  thus revenue from guaranteed minimum commitments is deferred until services are provided to an end user customer or until collected from the reseller and the reseller forfeits commitment fees at the end of the commitment period 
commencing in  we began recognizing revenue from a reseller based in china with whom we have an agreement but who is otherwise unaffiliated with webex 
due to certain legal restrictions in china relating to our ability to sell directly to customers in china  we entered into the reseller arrangement 
under this arrangement  we license our communication service offerings to the reseller for resale in china  and in consideration we receive licensing royalty revenue 
royalty revenue due to us is based on the level of revenue reported by the reseller and is recognized on a cash received basis from the reseller 
also in  subsequent to recognizing some revenue from our china based reseller  we entered into a loan agreement with this reseller 
under the terms of the agreement  webex agreed to loan our reseller operating capital to partially fund its early stage operations 
the reseller is currently operating at a loss and has a negative cash flow 
repayment of the loan amount by the reseller will be dependent on either another source of capital or profitable  cash positive operation of the reseller 
we believe that repayment is doubtful and therefore we have reserved the current amount outstanding on the loan of million through a charge to sales and marketing expense 
no additional revenue will be recognized from this reseller until all outstanding loan amounts are paid in full or the loan is otherwise settled 
sales reserves 
the sales reserve is an estimate for losses on receivables resulting from customer credits  cancellations and terminations and is recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time of the sale 
increases to sales reserve are charged to revenue  reducing the revenue otherwise reportable 
the sales reserve estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credits  cancellations and terminations 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the rate of future credits  cancellations and terminations being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of actual credits  cancellations and terminations is different than the historical rate  revenue would be different from what was reported 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for losses on accounts receivable due to customer credit risk 
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to general and administrative expense as bad debt expense 
losses on accounts receivable due to financial distress or failure of the customer are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credit losses 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the future rate of credit losses being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of future credit losses is greater than the historical rate  then the allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to provide for actual credit losses 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  the adequacy of the sales reserve account balance and the allowance for doubtful accounts account balance based on historical experience 
any adjustments to these accounts are reflected in the income statement for the current period  as an adjustment to revenue in the case of the sales reserve and as a general and administrative expense in the case of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

k the following presents the detail of the changes in the sales reserve and allowance for doubtful accounts for the last eight quarters ended december  in thousands quarter ended december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  balance at beginning of quarter sales reserve balance at beginning of quarter deducted from revenue amounts written off change balance at end of quarter sales reserve as a percentage of gross accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts balance at beginning of quarter charged credited to bad debt expense amounts written off change balance at end of quarter allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable balance at end of quarter 
gross accounts receivable total reserve as a percentage of gross accounts receivable income taxes 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each year based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider past performance  expected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is based over such future periods that we believe can be reasonably estimated 
changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the us and in international jurisdictions may cause us to change our judgments of future taxable income 
these changes  if any  may require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we have recorded 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of our assessment of projected future income  we released million of valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  again as a result of our assessment of projected future income  we released million of valuation allowance primarily related to the remaining net operating loss carryforwards 
this resulted in a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of million and a million credit to additional paid in capital attributable to the tax benefit of stock options 

k in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of intangible and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
amortizable intangible assets subject to this evaluation include acquired developed technology  patents  customer contracts and relationships  trade name and covenant not to sue 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset  significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions  and current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
our impairment evaluation of long lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
if  as a result of our analysis  we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
our impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value to the carrying value of our reporting unit with goodwill 
if our revenue and cost forecasts are not achieved  we may incur charges for goodwill impairment  which could have material adverse effect on our income statement 

k income statement the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  consolidated income statement data as a percentage of net revenue 
years ended december  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative equity based compensation total operating expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income net revenue 
net revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in  which represents an increase of and in and  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to growth in our subscribing customer base and the increased adoption by existing customers 
by the end of  the number of customers in our subscribing base had grown by more than from the end of one of the measurement tools  or metrics  which we use to help forecast future revenues  is what we refer to as our monthly revenue rate  or what we sometimes call mrr 
we define our monthly revenue rate as the sum of the following i committed monthly subscriptions  or the aggregate dollar amount of minimum minutes and ports that are contractually committed to us  as of the end of the month  and ii average monthly uncommitted revenue for the quarter  or the aggregate dollar amounts of per minute or usage based services such as overage  telephone  reseller related and pay per use revenues for the quarter divided by three 
our monthly subscription contracts at the end of december were approximately million and our average monthly uncommitted revenue in the quarter ended december  was million  and thus our monthly revenue rate exiting december was million 
certain one time revenues  such as set up fees  are not captured in mrr 
another metric we use to analyze customer losses and to help forecast future revenues is monthly average lost subscription mrr 
our lost subscription mrr metric is somewhat analogous to customer churn in the telecommunications business  except that our lost subscription mrr is more inclusive than the churn metric used in the telecommunications business 
whereas the telecommunications churn metric typically includes only revenues lost because of customer terminations  our lost subscription mrr includes not only revenues lost because of customer terminations but also revenues lost because existing customers either have reduced their subscription amounts or have elected to terminate their subscriptions in favor of purchasing from our partners 
we define our lost subscription mrr as the quotient obtained from the following i the average monthly dollar amount of lost subscription contracts including in that amount reductions in subscription amounts and subscription amounts lost to the partner channel during the quarter  divided by ii our total subscriptions at the end of the last month of the quarter plus the average monthly lost including existing customer subscriptions and switches to partners subscription contracts for the quarter 
as can be understood from the definition of lost subscription mrr  we calculate and evaluate lost subscription mrr on a quarterly basis 
our lost subscription mrr for the three months ended december  was per month 
the following table shows our mrr  and lost subscription mrr  for the five quarters ended december  in millions quarter ended december  september  june  march  december  uncommitted usage monthly average during the quarter contracted subscriptions at the end of the quarter total mrr of subscription mrr lost per month cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists of costs related to user set up  network and data center operations  technical support and training activities including internet access and telephony communication costs  personnel  licensed software and equipment costs and depreciation 
cost of revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in as a percent of revenue  cost of revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
these increases in absolute dollars in 
k cost of revenue were primarily due to increases in the cost for delivering existing and new services to more customers  additional technical staff to support our growing installed base of customers and new services  and expanding and improving our worldwide network 
in february  we purchased land and a building containing approximately  square feet of commercial grade facility of which  square feet consists of data infrastructure facility floor space for million 
land totaling million is not depreciated  and the building totaling million is being depreciated over years 
as part of the purchase  we also acquired certain items of data infrastructure equipment previously installed and situated on the property 
during  we used this facility as our network operating center as well as to expand our primary switching center to accommodate growing usage requirements on our webex mediatone network 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expense consists of personnel costs  including commissions  as well as costs of public relations  advertising  marketing programs  lead generation  travel and trade shows 
sales and marketing expense increased from million in to million in and to million in these increases were primarily due to increased sales spending to expand our sales force and to increased marketing spending for advertising focused on building brand awareness and generating sales leads 
research and development 
our research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  depreciation of equipment  supplies and consulting engineering services 
research and development expense increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase in research and development expense from to was primarily due to personnel related expenses resulting from increases in staffing 
in  research and development included million for the cost of engineering services provided by three companies in china providing engineering services to us on a contract basis 
our subsidiary webex china acquired substantially all of the assets of  and hired a substantial majority of the then employees of  these companies in february we incurred million of expense on a contract basis in prior to the acquisition 
the increase in research and development expense from to was primarily due to personnel related expenses resulting from increases in number of research and development personnel including increases in the number of such personnel in webex china 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  legal and general management  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and accounting  and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expense decreased from million in to million in  and increased to million in the decrease in general and administrative expense from to was primarily due to the decrease of bad debt expense 
bad debt expense decreased from million in to million in as a result of lower credit losses compared to historical periods 
the increases from to were primarily due to lower bad debt expense and higher professional fees  increases in personnel and payroll related expenses required to address new regulations including new regulations imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of bad debt expense decreased from million in to a million credit in this decrease in bad debt expense was primarily the result of lower credit losses compared to historical periods 
we expect bad debt expense to increase in future periods as a result of the increased size of our installed customer base 
equity based compensation 
our equity based compensation expense represents the amortization of deferred equity based compensation over the vesting period of incentive stock options granted to employees and expenses related to issuance of common stock warrants and options to non employees 
deferred equity based compensation represents the difference between the exercise price of the stock options granted to employees and the fair value of common stock at the time of those grants 
equity based compensation expense decreased from million in to million in and to million in the decreases from year to year were primarily due to the vesting of options granted  forfeitures of unvested options by terminated employees and the effects of the fluctuations of our stock price on the recognition of expense on options granted to non employees 
equity based compensation expense related to the unvested portion of non employee options will be impacted by future changes in our stock price and will fluctuate accordingly 
in connection with the calculation of equity based compensation expense  members of our board of directors are treated the same as employees of webex 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options using the fair value based method  to be recorded as expense in our results of operations 
since the accounting provision of sfas r is effective for reporting periods beginning after june   we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our equity based compensation expense 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net is comprised of interest income and expense  the effect of non functional currency transactions of our foreign subsidiaries and certain other expenses 
interest and other income  net increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the increase from to was primarily due to lower impairment charges on an investment and increased interest income as a result of higher cash and short term investments offset by lower market interest rates 
in  other expenses included an impairment write down of million  which was the remaining carrying amount of a million investment in a distribution 
k partner  tonbu  inc the decrease from to was primarily due to increased losses from currency exchange as a result of non functional currency transactions of our foreign subsidiaries  partially offset by higher interest earned as a result of increased cash invested 
in and  other expenses included a loss from currency exchange of million and million  respectively 
there was no material foreign currency exchange gain or loss in income taxes 
because we incurred net operating losses in years prior to  we paid no federal  state and foreign income taxes in that period  nor did we recognize any tax benefits for the related tax operating loss carryforwards 
during  we realized pre tax earnings and we had net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income in the us we recorded a provision for income tax of million during related to foreign and state taxes 
in  we continued to experience profitability and therefore  had evidence to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
accordingly  in we recorded a current provision for income tax of million related to federal  state and foreign income taxes  which was offset by the release of a valuation allowance in the amount of million based on projected future income 
in  the provision for income tax includes a release of million of valuation allowance primarily related to remaining net operating loss carryforwards  which resulted in a tax benefit of million and a million credit to additional paid in capital attributable to the tax benefit of stock options 
the release of the valuation allowance was recorded in the fourth quarter of when we updated our forecast of future projected income 
our effective tax rate in  and has fluctuated as a result of the valuation allowance adjustments described above and may continue to fluctuate in with the expected adoption of the new accounting standard requiring expensing of stock based employee compensation 
as of december   we have approximately million and million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes  respectively  available to offset income in future years 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in  and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in we have approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported net income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we have generated net positive cash flow from operations since the third quarter of we anticipate cash flow from operations will fund our current operations as well as fund future expansion 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  an increase of million compared with cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  as of december  and  we had no debt

as of december   approximately million worth of shares of the company s common stock has been repurchased 
as of december   our material purchase commitments  including usage of telecommunication lines and data services  equipment and software purchases and construction of leasehold improvements at new leased facilities  totaled million 
the majority of the purchase commitments are expected to be settled in cash within months with the longest commitment expiring august 
k we lease office facilities under various operating leases that expire through in april  we signed a lease to occupy space in a building located in santa clara  california  that will serve as our corporate headquarters 
the lease term is for approximately ten years  and initial occupancy commenced in the third quarter of future minimum lease payments under this lease begin in january and total an aggregate of million for the life of the lease 
total future minimum lease payments under other operating leases amount to approximately million 
we have a revolving credit line with a bank that provides available borrowings of up to million 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit line bear interest at the prime rate and may be repaid and reborrowed at any time prior to the maturity date 
the credit agreement expires on june  the credit agreement is unsecured and is subject to compliance with covenants  including a minimum quick ratio and minimum profitability  with which we are currently in compliance 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit line  but we did have a million letter of credit issued under the line as security for our new headquarters lease 
in the first quarter of  we purchased land and a building for approximately million and million  respectively 
additional cash will be required to expand our existing switching center in the new facility during in april  we completed the acquisition of cyberbazaar of bangalore india  an audio conferencing company  in order to directly pursue the web conferencing market in india 
we have renamed the cyberbazaar entity webex communications india pvt 
ltd 
webex communications india has continued to maintain the cyberbazaar offices  management team and employees 
the cyberbazaar acquisition did not have a material impact on our financial condition  income statement  or liquidity in  and we do not expect it to have a material impact in webex paid the former cyberbazaar shareholders approximately million in cash at closing 
additional payments of million were accrued in and paid in based on the performance of cyberbazaar in calendar year these additional payments are tied to continued employment of the former owners of cyberbazaar at our new india subsidiary and  accordingly  are being expensed as compensation 
in september  we entered into an agreement with ncr corporation  a technology company  which included the acquisition from ncr of certain intangible assets and a release from any past liability associated with those assets 
the terms of the agreement included our acquiring five ncr patents issued in the us together with the foreign counterparts of those patents  obtaining licenses to certain other ncr patents for the life of those patents  and mutually agreeing with ncr not to commence legal actions against each other on other patents in the companies respective portfolios for a period of three years 
the acquired patents were filed between and the amount paid in cash by us under the agreement  which was allocated to the acquired intangible assets based on fair value  was million and is being amortized into cost of revenues 
the remainder of the consideration under the agreement consisted of million  which was allocated to the value of releases from any liability that might have accrued prior to the effective date of the agreement and which was charged to cost of revenue in the three months ended september  we expect that existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we generated positive cash flow from operations in each quarter of we anticipate that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in and that existing cash reserves will therefore  be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements during this period 
if revenue in is less than anticipated  we may take steps to reduce our discretionary expenses  such as marketing  reduce planned capital expenditures or limit the hiring of new personnel 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available at all or  if available  would be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned technology and product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
long term contracts the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands

k recent accounting pronouncements see note s of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
factors that may affect results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if an adverse outcome of any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer 
although we realized net earnings for each of the twelve prior fiscal quarters including the four in  there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve comparable results in the future  and we may experience net losses in future years or quarters 
we realized net earnings in each of the twelve fiscal quarters in  and however  we may experience net losses in future years or quarters if the web communications market softens significantly  or if existing or future competitors reduce our current market share of the web communications market or require us to reduce our prices substantially to remain competitive 
if we incur net losses in the future  we may not be able to maintain or increase the number of our employees  our investment in expanding our services and network  or our sales  marketing and research and development programs in accordance with our present plans  each of which is critical to our long term success 
because our quarterly results vary and are difficult to predict  we may fail to meet quarterly financial expectations  which may cause our stock price to decline 
because of the emerging nature of the market for web communications services  and because of the uncertain impact of competition  our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may vary from publicly announced quarterly or annual financial guidance 
in addition  because we have two different pricing models and the less predictable of the two currently represents a greater percentage of our revenue than it has in the past  our revenue and operating results will be more difficult to predict 
the two pricing models are what we refer to as  respectively  subscription based and usage based  and the less predictable of the two is the usage based pricing model 
from a revenue standpoint  our dominant pricing model has been a monthly  fixed fee subscription model 
under this model  a customer may subscribe to a certain number of concurrent user ports per month  which would enable the customer to have up to that number of users connected to webex meetings at any one time  or to a monthly minimum minutes commitment which would provide the customer with up to a set number of people minutes per month with which to utilize our services 
another of our fixed fee offerings is the named host offering  in which a certain named individual may host meetings at which up to a certain number of attendees may participate 
in addition  there are several situations in which customers are charged per minute  or usage based pricing 
these include customer overage fees  most types of telephony charges  certain distribution partner arrangements and individual pay per use purchased directly from our website 
overage fees are charged when i a customer subscribing to a set number of ports uses more than the subscribed number of ports in one or more web conference sessions  or ii when a customer on a minutes pricing model uses more than its monthly commitment 
per minute telephone revenue comes when a customer in a web conference session elects to have us set up and run the audio portion of the conference  rather than the customer conducting its telephone usage independent of us 
the vast majority of revenue received from our telecommunications partner arrangements is usage  or per minute  based 
finally  we make available on our website  for purchase online by credit card and on a usage based basis  certain of our services 
historically  the majority of our revenue has been fixed fee  but the percentage of our revenue which is derived from usage based pricing models is greater than it has been in the past 
the various usage based revenue sources are more variable and difficult to predict than our fixed fee subscription revenue sources  given that customer demand may vary from 
k month to month depending on a number of factors  such as number of business days in a month or vacation patterns 
accordingly  to the extent the percent of our revenue derived from the various per minute or usage based sources increases  our overall revenue becomes more difficult to predict 
since fixed fee revenue is what we refer to as committed revenue  and the usage based revenue is what we call uncommitted revenue  another way to describe this increasing unpredictability is that our uncommitted revenues has grown faster than our committed revenues 
a number of other factors could also cause fluctuations in our operating results 
factors outside our control include our distribution partners degree of success in distributing our services to end users  the announcement  introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced services or products by our competitors  changes in offerings  sourcing or pricing policies of our competitors and our distributors  market acceptance of our services  the growth rate of the market for web communications services  and a trend toward lower average per minute prices in the telecommunications sector generally 
factors within our control include our ability to develop  enhance and maintain our web communications network in a timely manner  the mix of services we offer  and our introduction of new and enhanced services  our ability to attract and retain customers  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business and network infrastructure  and changes in our pricing policies 
if any of these factors impact our business in an unplanned and negative manner during a particular period  our operating results may be below market expectations  in which case the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
also  factors such as the growth rate of the market for our services  our ability to maintain and enhance our network services and platform  and our competitors success could impact our longer term financial performance by reducing demand for our services  which would harm our business 
we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase  and if our revenue does not correspondingly increase  our business and operating results will suffer 
we expect to continue to spend substantial financial and other resources on developing and introducing new services  on expanding our sales and marketing organization and our network infrastructure  and on upgrading leased facilities such as our corporate headquarters 
for example  in the first quarter of we purchased a building in mountain view  california which will serve as our primary network switching facility  and in the second quarter of we entered into a ten year lease for space in a building located in santa clara  california which we have begun occupying and which became our corporate headquarters in january we base our expansion plans and expense levels in part on our expectations of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect  we may be unable to reduce proportionately our operating expenses for that quarter  in which case our operating results for that quarter would suffer 
and because our fixed expenses have increased appreciably due to our expectations relating to future revenue levels  if our revenue is sufficiently below expectation in one or more quarters  we may be unable to effect proportionate reductions in our operating expenses in a timely manner and therefore  our operating results could suffer 
most of our customers do not have long term obligations to purchase our services  therefore  our revenue and operating results could decline if our customers do not continue to use our services 

k almost all of our customer contracts have initial terms of three to months 
these contracts are typically automatically renewed except where a customer takes action to cancel a contract prior to the end of an initial or renewal term 
our monthly average lost subscription mrr  an internal measurement tool we use to evaluate subscription based revenues we have lost  for the quarter ended december  was 
in addition to cancellation  a customer may stop buying our services directly from us and instead start purchasing our services from one of our resellers 
a customer may also change the number of ports or types of services that the customer purchases directly from us such that the overall revenue to us is lower 
the reasons why a customer would cancel use of our services have included the failure of the customer s employees to learn about and use our services  the failure of the services to meet the customer s expectations or requirements  financial difficulties experienced by the customer  or the customer s decision to use services or products offered by a competitor 
we may not obtain a sufficient amount of new or incremental business to compensate for any customers that we may lose 
the loss of existing customers or our failure to obtain additional customers would harm our business and operating results 
our business and operating results may suffer if we fail to establish distribution relationships  if our distribution partners do not successfully market and sell our services  or if we fail to become a significant participant in the telecommunications provider distribution channel 
as of december   we had distribution agreements in place with telecommunications partners and software vendors that for accounted for of our revenue  which revenue generally consists of initial set up fees  commitment payments  and service fees 
the majority of the payments received from these distribution partners are per minute or usage based payments 
the minority of payments are fixed fee payments and are initially recorded as deferred revenue because we defer revenue related to initial set up fees received at the beginning of the relationship and record revenue from subscription services over the course of the service period as the distribution partner resells our services 
we also do not recognize commitment fees as revenue until the commitment fee is paid and fully earned by the use of services by the reseller s end user customers or forfeiture of the commitment at the end of the commitment period 
we cannot anticipate the amount of revenue we will derive from these relationships in the future 
we must continue to establish and extend these distribution partnerships 
establishing these distribution relationships can take as long as several months or more 
it typically also takes several months before our distribution arrangements generate significant revenue 
our distribution partners are not prohibited from offering and reselling the products and services of our competitors and may choose to devote insufficient resources to marketing and supporting our services or to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products and services of other companies 
also  with regard to the telecommunications provider distribution channel for web conferencing services which may prove economically significant in the future  our web conferencing competitors may be more successful in partnering with telecommunications providers  or telecommunications providers may independently enter the web conferencing business  either alone or with web conferencing vendors that do not include us 
if we fail to establish new distribution relationships in a timely manner  if our distribution partners do not successfully distribute our services  if we lose existing distribution partners for whatever reason or if we fail to become a significant participant in the telecommunications provider distribution channel  our ability to maintain current levels of market acceptance of our web communications services will suffer and our business and operating results will be harmed 
our total revenue may suffer if we are unable to manage our distribution relationships successfully to prevent the undercutting of our direct sales efforts 
we sell our services directly to customers and also indirectly through our distribution partners 
we enter into distribution relationships so that we can obtain additional customers through distribution partners that we could not obtain through our direct sales efforts 
under our agreements with our distribution partners  either the distribution partner or webex bills the end user customers 
when the distribution partner bills the end user  we sell the services on a discounted basis to the distribution partner  which in turn marks up the price and sells the services to the end user 
in such cases  we contract directly with the distribution partner  whom in this type of distribution arrangement we refer to as a reseller  and revenue is recognized on amounts charged to the distribution partner 
a significant majority of our distribution partner agreements are of this type 
we also have distribution arrangements where we  rather than the distribution partner  bill the end user 
when we bill the end user  a percentage of the proceeds generated from the distribution partner s sale of webex services is paid to the distribution partner  whom in this type of distribution arrangement we sometimes call a referral agent 
revenue is recognized based on amounts charged to the end user and amounts paid to the distribution partner are recorded as sales expense 
in either case  the revenue received by us when a sale is made by a distribution partner  is not as great as it would have been had the sale been made by us directly  for the same volume of webex services 
to the extent that sales of our services by our distribution partners are sales that  absent the existence of the distribution arrangement  would be made by our direct sales force  our sales revenue may decrease 
additionally  to the extent our existing customers discontinue direct agreements with us in order to purchase our services from distribution partners who are resellers  our revenue may decrease 

k we expect to depend on sales of our standalone webex meeting center service for a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our standalone webex meeting center service  the service which generates our largest sales revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  we have developed and are selling other services  such as our event center  training center  support center and enterprise edition services  our smarttech service  our new sales center service launched in september  our new mywebexpc offering launched in january  and our audio conferencing service offered through our recently acquired subsidiary in india 
however  these services may not provide significant revenue in the future 
if we are not successful in developing  deploying and selling services other than our standalone meeting center service  and if sales of our standalone meeting center service decline or do not increase  our operating results will suffer 
if our services fail to function when used by large numbers of participants  we may lose customers and our business and reputation may be harmed 
our business strategy requires that our services be able to accommodate large numbers of meetings and users at any one time 
our data network monitoring system measures the capacity of our data network by bandwidth use 
the goal of our network capacity planning is to have our average daily peak usage be less than of our data network capacity 
from time to time daily peak usage exceeds of data network capacity 
however  since mid we have been able to maintain average daily peak usage at under of our data network capacity by adding capacity whenever there is a trend toward increased average daily peak usage 
during the quarter ended december   the average of our daily peak usages  as a percentage of our data network capacity  was less than of our total capacity 
in addition to our data network  we also maintain an integrated telephony network for which capacity planning is necessary 
if we fail to increase capacity in our data and telephony networks consistent with the growth in usage of each  the performance of these networks could be adversely impacted 
in addition  we may encounter performance problems when making upgrades and modifications to either or both of these networks 
if our services do not perform adequately because of capacity related problems with either or both of our data and telephony networks  particularly our data network  we may lose customers and be unable to attract new customers and our operating results would be harmed 
if our marketing  branding and lead generation efforts are not successful  our business may be harmed 
we believe that continued marketing and brand recognition efforts will be critical to achieve widespread acceptance of our web communications services 
our marketing and advertising campaigns or branding efforts may not be successful given the expense required 
for example  certain sales promotion initiatives  such as free trial use  may dampen short term sales even as such initiatives attempt to cultivate participants desire to purchase and use our services  in that a customer who might have otherwise purchased our services will instead receive free use of our services for the trial period of time 
in addition  failure to adequately generate and develop sales leads could cause our future revenue growth to decrease 
also  our ability to generate and cultivate sales leads into large organizations  where there is the potential for significant use of our services and where any future marketplace standardization of our service might emerge  could harm our business 
there is no assurance that we will identify  and if we identify be able to secure  the number of strategic sales leads necessary to help generate standardized marketplace acceptance of our services  or to maintain rates of revenue growth we have experienced in the past 
if our marketing  branding or lead generation efforts are not successful  our business and operating results will be harmed 
we rely on our china subsidiary  which exposes us to risks of economic instability in china  risks related to political tension between china and the united states  and risks arising from an inability to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we have relied  and for the foreseeable future we plan to continue to rely  on our subsidiary webex china to conduct a significant portion of our quality assurance testing and software development activities  and also a number of other activities including lead research for our sales personnel  creation of technical documentation  preparation of marketing materials and the provisioning of customer websites 
we have five facilities in china  located in each of hefei  hangzhou  shanghai  shenzhen and suzhou 
our china subsidiary employed  as of december   approximately of our worldwide employees 
our reliance on webex china for a significant portion of our quality assurance  software development and other activities exposes us to a variety of economic and political risks including  but not limited to  technology development restrictions  potentially costly and pro employee labor laws and regulations governing our employees in china  and travel restrictions 
further  our per employee productivity is lower in china than it is the united states  due to employee turnover in china and the length of time required for a new employee in china to become productive in the position for which he or she was hired 
we also face foreign exchange risk in that we have significant payment obligations that must be made in chinese currency including employee salaries and lease payments  which are currently not 
k offset by sales revenue in china 
the chinese currency  or yuan  is a currency whose rate of exchange with other currencies is controlled by the chinese government  and any removal of that control could result in a significant appreciation of the yuan relative to the us dollar and thereby increase the negative effect of the foreign exchange risk we face in china 
in addition  political and economic tensions between the united states and china could harm our ability to conduct operations in china  which could increase our operating costs and harm our business and operations 
if we lost the services of our webex china subsidiary  we would incur increased costs  which would harm our operating results and business 
finally  because a substantial amount of our research and development activity takes place in china  our business may be harmed if we encounter difficulties enforcing our intellectual property rights there 
our international business activities expose us to foreign exchange risk  foreign country economic conditions and the challenges of managing a global business operation  any of which if not managed successfully could harm our financial condition 
a small  but growing  part of our sales and support activities  and a significant portion of our customer provisioning and research and development activities  are conducted outside of the united states 
these services are generally priced in the local currency 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities or other actions to decrease fluctuations in operating results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  although we may do so when the amount of revenue obtained from sources outside the united states becomes significant 
we conduct sales  marketing  network and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states  and we currently have subsidiaries in each of the following countries china  hong kong  japan  australia  india  the united kingdom  france  germany and the netherlands 
our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of challenges generally associated with managing a global business including  among others  the following staffing and managing international operations including multiple non us subsidiary structures  handling the various accounting  tax and legal complexities arising from our international operations  properly designing  testing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting in our non us subsidiaries  as required under sarbanes oxley related laws and regulations  understanding cultural differences affecting non us employee relations or sales transactions  and addressing political  economic or social instabilities that may arise from time to time in a specific non us country or region 
the cost of meeting these and other challenges  or our failure to address adequately one or more of such challenges  could have a material adverse impact on our costs  expenses  and financial condition 
we could incur unexpected costs resulting from claims relating to use of our services 
many of the business interactions supported by our services are critical to our customers businesses 
although it is not standard practice for us to do so  in some situations we do make warranties in our customer agreements as to service uptime  or the percentage of time that our network will be operational and available for customer use 
accordingly  any failure by us to fulfill such warranty obligation  or more generally any failure in a customer s business interaction or other communications activity that is caused or allegedly caused by our services  could result in a claim for damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure  and cause us to incur unexpected costs 
our customers and end users may use our services to share confidential and sensitive information  and if our system security is breached  our reputation could be harmed and we may lose customers 
our customers and end users may use our services to share confidential and sensitive information  the security of which is critical to their business 
third parties may attempt to breach our security or that of our customers 
we may be liable to our customers for any breach in security  and any breach could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers 
in addition  computers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to resolve problems caused by any breach  including litigation related expenses if we are sued 

k the software underlying our services is complex  and our business and reputation could suffer if our services fail to perform properly due to undetected defects or similar problems with our underlying software 
complex software  such as the software underlying our services  often contains undetected defects 
we may be forced to delay commercial release of new services or new versions of existing services until problems are corrected and  in some cases  may need to implement enhancements to correct defects or bugs that we do not detect until after deployment of our services 
if we do detect a defect or bug in our software before we introduce new versions of our services  we might have to limit our services for an extended period of time while we resolve the problem 
in addition  problems with the software underlying our services could result in damage to our reputation  damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  loss of or delay in revenue  delays in or loss of market acceptance of our services  and unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 
if our services do not work with the many hardware and software platforms used by our customers and end users  our business may be harmed 
we currently serve customers and end users that use a wide variety of constantly changing hardware and software applications and platforms 
if our services are unable to support these platforms  they may fail to gain broad market acceptance  which would cause our operating results to suffer 
our success depends on our ability to deliver our services to multiple platforms and existing  or legacy  systems and to modify our services and underlying technology as new versions of applications are introduced 
in addition  the success of our services depends on our ability to anticipate and support new standards  especially web standards 
we license third party technologies  and if we cannot continue to license these or alternate technologies in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms  our business could suffer 
we intend to continue to license technologies from third parties  including applications used in our research and development activities and technology  which is integrated into our services 
for example  we license database  operating system  server and enterprise marketing automation software  billing software  font rendering technology and voice over internet protocol voip technology 
these third party technologies  and any that we may utilize in the future  may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  we may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our services  our marketing communications operations or our online sales operations 
this in turn could increase our costs and harm our business and operating results 
our recent growth has placed a strain on our infrastructure and resources  and if we fail to manage our future growth to meet customer and distribution partner requirements  both within the us and internationally  our business could suffer 
we have experienced a period of rapid expansion in our personnel  facilities  and infrastructure that has placed a significant strain on our resources 
for example  our worldwide headcount increased from  at december  to  at december  we expect to continue to increase our personnel in our expansion has placed  and we expect that it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
in addition  we are completing the physical transfer of our network switching operations center to a new building and  separately  we are continuing periodically to update our information technology infrastructure to meet increased requirements for capacity  flexibility and efficiency resulting from the growth of our business 
in the event these updated systems or technologies do not meet our requirements or are not deployed in a successful or timely manner  our business may suffer 
any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could disrupt our operations or delay execution of our business plan and could consequently harm our business 

k if we unexpectedly lose the services of subrah s 
iyar  our chief executive officer  min zhu  our chief technical officer  or bill heil  our president and chief operating officer  our business may be harmed 
our success will depend on our senior executives 
in particular  the unexpected loss of the services of any of our chief executive officer and co founder  subrah s 
iyar  our chief technical officer and co founder  min zhu  or our president and chief operating officer  bill heil  would harm our business 
we do not have long term employment agreements with or life insurance policies on any of our senior executives 
if we are unable to attract  integrate and retain qualified personnel  our business could suffer 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled engineering  technical  managerial  sales and marketing and customer support personnel 
we expect to continue to increase our personnel in as the us economy in general and the technology sector in particular continue to grow  we could encounter increasing difficulty hiring qualified personnel 
if we encounter difficulty hiring  integrating and retaining a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future  the quality of our web communications services and our ability to develop new services  obtain new customers and provide a high level of customer service could all suffer  and consequently the health of our overall business could suffer 
if in our hiring we hire employees from our competitors  we face a risk that a competitor may claim that we have engaged in unfair hiring practices  which could cause us to incur costs in defending ourselves against such claims  regardless of their merits 
also  our competitors appear to value certain specialized skills possessed by certain of our technical and sales employees  having hired or attempted to hire such individuals in recent quarters 
if the rate at which such employees are hired away increases appreciably  our business and operations could be harmed 
interruption or malfunction of our internal business processing systems  including a new system we installed during  could disrupt the services we provide our customers and could harm our business 
our business  with its approximately  subscription customers and large number of daily transactions  is substantially dependent on the continuous and error free functioning of our automated business processing systems covering such areas as order entry  billing  contract management and collection activities 
during the third quarter of  we completed deployment of and are now utilizing a comprehensive new proprietary business processing system to capture and record for billing and financial statement generation purposes  customer usage of our various services 
any material interruption or malfunction of one or more of the underlying components of this new business processing system  including bugs  start up problems or other malfunctions relating to the new system  could cause delays or errors in transaction processing  could negatively affect customer relationships  and could harm our business 
in addition  because a substantial amount of the new business processing system was developed by us rather than having been purchased from an outside vendor  we must rely on our own know how and experience to identify  diagnose and repair any malfunction of such software rather than being able to rely on an outside vendor and multiple other users of the system to identify and correct such defects 
actual malfunction related costs that have had and could continue to have negative effects on our business include  with respect to certain segments of our business  a modestly longer collection cycle as a result of delayed invoicing or invoice presentation issues  and our having to deploy additional resources internally to complete the processing of certain sales transactions 
interruptions in either our internal or outsourced computer and communications systems could reduce our ability to provide our revenue generating services and could harm our business and reputation 
the success of our web communications services depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our internal and outsourced computer and communications hardware and software systems 
during the third quarter of  we completed installation of an updated version of our server management system  which system monitors and reports on the status of our various servers through which our real time web communications services are delivered to customers 
any system failure  including the malfunction of the new server management system  that causes an interruption in our web communications services or a decrease in their performance  could harm our relationships with our customers and distribution partners 
in addition  some of our communications hardware and software are hosted at third party co location facilities 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  telecommunications failures  physical or remote break ins  sabotage  computer viruses and intentional acts of vandalism 
in addition  third party co location facilities may discontinue their operations due to poor business performance 
because a substantial part of our central computer and communications hardware and network operations are located in the san francisco bay area  an earthquake or other natural disaster could impair the performance of our entire network 
in the event of damage to or interruption of our internal or outsourced systems  if we are unable to implement our disaster recovery plans or our efforts to restore our services to normal levels in a timely manner are 
k not successful  our business would be harmed 
in addition  business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 
finally  in february  we purchased approximately nine acres of real property in mountain view  california on which resides a building which we use primarily as a switching center facility to accommodate growing usage requirements on our webex mediatone network 
any malfunction or service interruption we suffer relating to our network switching operations to the new building could disrupt our communications services  could harm our relationships with our customers and distribution partners  and could harm our business 
we might have liability for content or information transmitted through our communications services 
claims may be asserted against us for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other legal theories based on the nature and content of the materials transmitted through our web communications services 
defending against such claims could be expensive  could be time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
in addition  any imposition of liability could harm our reputation and our business and operating results  or could result in the imposition of criminal penalties 
our success depends upon the patent protection of our software and technology 
our success and ability to compete depend to a significant degree upon the protection of our underlying software and our proprietary technology through patents 
we regard the effective protection of patentable inventions as important to our future opportunities 
we currently have issued patents  including eight we acquired in connection with our june acquisition of certain assets of presenter  inc and five we purchased in from ncr corporation 
our patents are in several areas including peer to peer connections to facilitate conferencing  document annotation  optimizing data transfer  graphical user interface for extracting video presentations  and remote collaboration systems involving multiple computers 
we currently have over patent applications pending in the united states including eight patent applications assigned to us in the presenter asset acquisition transaction 
we may seek additional patents in the future 
our current patent applications cover different aspects of the technology used to deliver our services and are important to our ability to compete 
however  it is possible that any patents acquired by or issued to us may not be broad enough to protect us  any issued patent could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties  which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in those patents  current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our services or design around any of our patents  our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  and effective patent protection  including effective legal enforcement mechanisms against those who violate our patent related assets  may not be available in every country in which we do business 
we also rely upon trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our technology  which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
we also rely on a combination of laws  such as copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses  to establish and protect our technology 
our trademarks include webex word and design  webex bifurcated ball logo design  webex 
com  mywebex  mywebexpc  bringing the meeting to you  mediatone  meeting center  webex meeting center  event center  webex event center  we ve got to start meeting like this  presentation studio  webex connect  webex global watch  webex contact center  webex access anywhere and power panels 
federal trademark applications acquired from presenter consist of the trademarks ipresenter  ipresentation and instant presentation 
we also refer to trademarks of other corporations and organizations in this document 
also  our software is automatically protected by copyright law 
these forms of intellectual property protection are critically important to our ability to establish and maintain our competitive position 
however  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights  laws and contractual restrictions  particularly those existing within or applied within non us jurisdictions such as china  may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter others from developing similar technologies  
k effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection  including effective legal enforcement mechanisms against those who violate our trademark  copyright or trade secret assets  may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries  other companies may claim common law trademark rights based upon state or foreign laws that precede the federal registration of our marks  and policing unauthorized use of our services and trademarks is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it  which would significantly harm our business 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of the copyrights  trademarks and patents of third parties 
our services may infringe issued patents 
in addition  we may be unaware of filed patent applications which have not yet been made public and which relate to our services 
from time to time  we have received notices alleging that we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 
in such cases  we investigate the relevant facts  respond to the allegations and  where case facts and other conditions warrant  consider settlement options 
intellectual property claims that may be asserted against us in the future could result in litigation 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
intellectual property litigation could also require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  in the event of a successful claim of infringement 
our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders  cause us to incur significant expenses  fail to complement our existing revenue models or harm our operating results 
we may acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies or services 
for example  in april we completed the acquisition of cyberbazaar  the principal business of which today is audio conferencing 
we have changed the name cyberbazaar to webex communications india pvt 
ltd 
integrating any newly acquired businesses  employees  technologies or services may be expensive and time consuming 
to finance any material acquisitions  it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and  in the case of equity financings as with acquisitions made with our stock  may result in dilution to our stockholders 
we may be unable to complete any acquisitions or investments on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
even if completed  we may be unable to operate any acquired businesses profitably or successfully integrate the employees  technology  products or services of any acquired businesses into our existing business 
to illustrate  in connection with the cyberbazaar acquisition in april  we added the former cyberbazaar workforce to our worldwide employee headcount  we continue to offer the former cyberbazaar audio conferencing services and we plan to eventually integrate our webex audio conferencing and network technology into the webex india operation 
however  if we fail to integrate the former cyberbazaar employees and other employees hired after the acquisition into our company  or otherwise fail to successfully manage these new operations as our new webex india subsidiary in india  or if we fail to successfully upgrade the former cyberbazaar audio conferencing assets or expand our worldwide network into india  the acquisition may not meet our financial expectations 
if we are unable to integrate any newly acquired entities or technologies effectively  including those related to our cyberbazaar acquisition  our operating results could suffer 
future acquisitions by us  or deterioration of the businesses we have acquired  could also result in large and immediate write downs  or incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  any of which would harm our operating results 
we must compete successfully in the web communications services market 
the market for web communications services is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and is significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies in regards to specific elements of our web communications services 
for example  we compete with providers of traditional communications technologies such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  applications software and tools companies  and web conferencing services such as centra software  cisco systems  citrix systems  genesys  ibm  macromedia  microsoft  oracle and raindance 
other companies could choose to extend their products and services to include interactive communications in the future 
many of 
k our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do 
our current and future competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established  and may in the future establish  cooperative relationships with third parties and with each other to increase the availability of their products and services to the marketplace 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services  either of which could harm our business and operating results 
for example  we offer voip to customers seeking that option for the audio portion of their web conferencing service activity  which puts us in competition with increasing numbers of low cost providers of voip products and services of ever increasing quality 
one or more of these competitors may offer a sufficiently low cost  feature attractive  audio centric voip offering that  though not a web conferencing offering  might divert business away from us  or one or more of these competitors might themselves leverage their experience in the voip segment of web communications to develop and market a web conferencing product or service of their own 
finally  our revenues and market share could also be reduced if  during this time period where the market is still relatively new and competitors are still emerging  we do not capitalize on our current market leadership by timely developing and executing corporate strategies that will increase the likelihood that our services will be accepted as the market standard in preference to the offerings of our current and future competitors 
competition from microsoft for the general web conferencing market or from other vendors specifically targeted at the low end market may adversely affect our operating results 
microsoft has become a more active participant in the web communications services market since its acquisition of our competitor placeware in microsoft has a current product offering which is competitive with ours and which is called microsoft office live meeting 
microsoft office live meeting is being marketed together with other microsoft software products and services under the name microsoft office system 
microsoft has recently announced certain improvements to the live meeting service and other product developments  and also an acquisition related to the areas of communication and collaboration 
microsoft s investment of development and marketing resources in products or services that compete directly with webex and microsoft s integrations of competitive functionality with other communication and collaboration offerings may have an adverse impact on webex s business 
microsoft may attempt to leverage its dominant market position in the operating system  productivity application or browser markets  through technical integration or bundled offerings  to expand its presence in the web communications market  which could make it difficult for other vendors of web communications products and services  such as webex  to compete 
in addition some competitors offer web communications products and services targeted at customers who are more price conscious and are less concerned about functionality  scalability  integration and security features 
such offerings may make it more difficult for webex to compete in that segment of the market and may cause some of webex s existing customers to switch to these competitors 
if webex is unable to deliver competitive offerings for that segment of the market  webex s operating results may suffer 
our future success depends on the broad market adoption and acceptance of web communications services 
the market for web communications services is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
market demand for communications services over the web is uncertain 
if the market for web communications services does not continue to grow  our business and operating results will be harmed 
factors that might influence broad market acceptance of our services include the following  all of which are beyond our control willingness of businesses and end users to use web communications services for websites  the continued growth and viability of the web as an instrument of commerce  the willingness of our distribution partners to integrate web communications services for websites in their service offerings  and the ongoing level of security and reliability for conducting business over the web 
our success depends on the continued growth of web usage and the continued growth in reliability and capacity of the internet 
because customers access our network through the web  our revenue growth depends on the continued development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this continued development of the web would include maintenance of a reliable network with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  as well as timely development of complementary products and services  including high speed modems and other high bandwidth communications technologies  for providing reliable  high performance internet access 
k and services 
the success of our business will rely on the continued improvement of the web as a convenient and reliable means of customer interaction and commerce  as well as an efficient medium for the delivery and distribution of information by businesses to their employees 
if increases in web usage or the continued growth in reliability and capacity of the internet fail to materialize  our ability to deliver our services may be adversely affected and our operating results could be harmed 
we face risks associated with government regulation of the internet  and related legal uncertainties 
currently  a relatively small number of existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the internet  other than laws generally applicable to businesses 
many internet related laws and regulations  however  are pending and may be adopted in the united states  in individual states and local jurisdictions and in other countries 
these laws may relate to many areas that impact our business  including encryption  network and information security  the convergence of traditional communication services  such as telephone services  with internet communications  taxes and wireless networks 
for example  media reports have surfaced from time to time concerning possible future regulation  and perhaps also taxation  of voip products and services similar to the manner in which current telephony services are currently regulated and taxed 
these types of regulations could differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions both inside and outside the united states 
non us countries and political organizations may impose  or favor  more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the united states  thus furthering the complexity of regulation 
in addition  state and local governments within the united states may impose regulations in addition to  inconsistent with  or stricter than federal regulations 
the adoption of such laws or regulations  and uncertainties associated with their validity  interpretation  applicability and enforcement  may affect the available distribution channels for  and the costs associated with  our products and services 
the adoption of such laws and regulations may harm our business 
in addition to the effect of such potential future laws and regulations  existing laws and regulations in both domestic and non us jurisdictions could be interpreted to apply to our web communications business  in which case our regulatory compliance obligations and associated financial burdens could increase 
an example of a non us law or regulation that we are expending resources  both infrastructure related and legal related  to comply with are the various privacy statutes enacted by the european union 
examples of us laws and regulations that we may have to expend greater resources to comply with are various us state sales tax laws and regulations that may be held by the applicable authorities to apply to the sale of our web communications services 
current and future economic and political conditions may adversely affect our business 
current economic and political conditions  including the effects of the war in iraq  uncertainty about iraq s political future  continuing tensions throughout the middle east and the supply and price of petroleum products continue to impact the us and global economy  and any negative development in one of these geopolitical areas could cause significant worldwide economic harm 
any sustained increase in the price of petroleum products above present levels would likely negatively impact the us and world economies generally  which in turn could hurt our business 
any significant downturn in the us economy  whether due to the effect of increasing interest rates or otherwise  could cause existing or potential customers to decide not to purchase our services  which in turn would hurt our business 
to the extent that changes in laws  regulations or taxes in the us diminish the economic benefits of arrangements by us companies with non us subsidiaries or suppliers  our business would be adversely affected 
as with our operations in china  our operations in india could be significantly disrupted if us relations with india deteriorate  or if india becomes involved in armed conflict or otherwise becomes politically destabilized 
moreover  depending on severity  a significant terrorist attack anywhere in the world and particularly one within the united states could have a significantly negative effect on both the domestic and global economies 
if economic conditions worsen as a result of economic  political or social turmoil or military conflict  or if there are further terrorist attacks in the united states or elsewhere  our customers may not be able to pay for our services and our distribution partners may cease operations  which may harm our operating results 
we may experience electrical system failures whether accidentally or intentionally caused  which could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
california has experienced  and could in the future experience energy shortages and blackouts 
as was made evident by the well publicized august blackout which simultaneously affected several eastern us states for a period exceeding hours  a similarly widespread  long lasting power outage could occur in northern california 
as with the eastern us power supply  an important source of electrical power to northern california consists of a multi state grid situated in the western united states 
an accidental interruption of  or criminal disruption to  a key supply or distribution component of the power grid could cause a significant power outage in northern california 
if power outages or energy price 
k increases occur in the future in northern california or other locations where we maintain operations  such events could disrupt our operations  prevent us from providing our services  harm our reputation  and result in a loss of revenue and increase in our expenses  all of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our results of operations and cause us to change our business practices 
we prepare our financial statements to conform with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in the united states 
these accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
changes to those rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  accounting policies affecting many aspects of our business  including rules relating to employee stock option grants  have recently been revised or are under review 
the financial accounting standards board fasb during the fourth quarter of adopted final rules which will change the way companies account for equity compensation in their financial statements 
fasb has stated that the new accounting standard would become effective for fiscal periods beginning after june this change in accounting standards will require us to report as a compensation expense options granted to and shares purchased by our employees pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  and will have a negative impact on our reported net income 
because of the negative impact such accounting will have on our net income  we are likely to re evaluate the form and amount of employee equity based compensation we will provide in the future  such as reducing the number of stock options granted to employees or the discount available for participants in our employee stock purchase plan 
these possible changes in equity compensation practices would lessen the projected negative impact of the new fasb rule on our reported net income 
however  if we decide to reduce the amount of equity based compensation we provide to our employees  we may be forced to increase cash compensation to employees to make up for the loss of equity based compensation opportunities  which would increase our expenses 
apart from these quantifiable effects of the new fasb rule  we may have trouble retaining or recruiting key technical or management talent if we fail to offer compensation packages that are competitive with those being offered by other public or privately held technology companies 
our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile because of stock market fluctuations that affect the prices of technology stocks 
a decline in our stock price could result in securities class action litigation against us that could divert management s attention and harm our business 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
for example  between january  and february   our stock price has traded as high as on april  and as low as on july  our stock price could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including variations in our actual or anticipated operating results  sales of substantial amounts of our stock  announcements by or about us or our competitors  including technological innovation  new products  services or acquisitions  litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  conditions in the internet industry  changes in laws  regulations  rules or standards by governments  regulatory bodies  exchanges or standards bodies  and changes in securities analysts estimates of our performance  or our failure to meet analysts expectations 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for internet technology companies in particular  continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market prices of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation 
if we were to be the object of securities class action litigation  we could face substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 

k item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
a small  but growing  part of our business is conducted outside the united states 
in the majority of non us transactions  whether they be sales revenue transactions or the payment of expenses or other obligations owing in the non us country  the currency involved is the local  non us currency 
in some countries we have far more sales collections than we do payment obligations  in other countries  the reverse is true 
for example  in china we have significant payment obligations that must be made in chinese currency including employee salaries and lease payments  which are currently not offset by sales revenue in china 
as a result of this imbalance between local currency collections and payments in certain non us countries  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in such foreign markets 
when the amount of revenue obtained from sources outside the united states becomes significant  we may engage in hedging activities or other actions to decrease fluctuations in operating results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or market risk sensitive instruments 
instead  we invest in highly liquid investments with short maturities 
accordingly  we do not expect any material loss from these investments and believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material
