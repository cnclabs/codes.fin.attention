item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of prior financial information 
in addition  based on our internal investigation  we concluded that there was evidence that one or more of our former officers may have breached their fiduciary duties to the company 
the officers and employees about whom the investigation had concerns are no longer with the company 
see item legal proceedings for a summary of legal proceedings we have commenced against certain of our former executive officers 
our menu we believe that the authenticity  quality and consistency of our food are the most important components of our long term success 
in contrast to the levity of our decor and ambiance  we take menu development and food preparation very seriously 
each of our buca di beppo and vinny t s of boston menus is based on authentic family recipes enjoyed for generations in the villages of southern italy and then adapted to american ingredients 
we make occasional trips to italy and sicily to find new recipes for our menus that are then extensively tested and refined before introduction in our restaurants 
some of buca di beppo restaurant s most popular menu items include garlic bread with mozzarella  buca di beppo salad  pizza arrabiatta  garlic mashed potatoes  spaghetti with half pound meat balls  tortelloni  chicken marsala  veal parmigiana and tiramisu 
we also offer a baked specialties menu that includes baked ravioli  cannelloni  manicotti and stuffed shells 
these high quality food items are served in small and large family style portions 
in family style serving  each item is shared by the entire table  which encourages guests to interact and enjoy the meal together 
we also offer daily specials centered on our popular southern italian cooking 
we believe that our daily specials play a vital role in keeping the menu fresh and allow us to test prospective menu items 
our foods  often seasoned with garlic and served with vine ripened tomatoes  communicate the pure  powerful flavors of the southern italian kitchen 
during fiscal  in an effort to increase our guest counts by attracting smaller parties and allowing our guests to try a wider variety of our menu items  we introduced smaller portion sizes for a majority of entrees on our menu 
this concept  which we call buca small  has been implemented at all of our buca di beppo restaurants and accounted for about of our total food sales in fiscal vinny t s of boston s offers a diverse menu featuring a wide variety of appetizers  soups and salads  pastas  meats  seafood  parmigianas  pizzas  chicken and veal  and desserts 
menu items include fried mozzarella  warm tomato salad  homemade lasagna  grilled pork chops with peppers  linguini with clam sauce  veal parmigiana  pepperoni pizza  chicken piccata  and cannoli 
the menu features individual and family style portions 
all of our menu items can be enjoyed either in the restaurant or as take out 
in fiscal  take out sales represented approximately of our total sales 
we believe that take out represents a continued opportunity to build our sales 
however  we expect that as our take out sales increase  our alcohol sales will likely decrease as a percentage of total sales as off site sales of alcohol and liquor are generally not allowed at our restaurants 

index to financial statements our menu pricing is consistent within a market  but may differ slightly market to market 
the average check per buca di beppo guest in fiscal was approximately including beverages  a decrease from fiscal in fiscal  alcoholic beverages  primarily table wine  accounted for approximately of sales at our buca di beppo restaurants 
at vinny t s of boston  our average check per guest in fiscal was approximately including beverages  which is lower that the average check for our buca di beppo restaurants because vinny t s serves lunch at all of its locations 
in fiscal  alcoholic beverages  accounted for approximately of restaurant sales at our vinny t s of boston restaurants 
operations our ability to effectively manage restaurants in a diverse geographic area will continue to be critical to our success 
for our buca di beppo restaurants  we currently have senior  divisional and regional vice presidents reporting to our chief operating officer 
for our vinny t s of boston restaurants  we currently have one senior vice president of operations reporting to our chief executive officer 
each of these vice presidents is expected to effectively manage up to restaurants and supervise and assist each restaurant manager  or paisano partner  within his or her territory with the goal of achieving a targeted return on investment through the successful implementation and operation of our buca di beppo and vinny t s of boston concepts 
the typical buca di beppo restaurant management team consists of a paisano partner  a kitchen manager  an assistant general manager and an assistant kitchen manager 
the typical vinny t s of boston restaurant consists of a paisano partner  a kitchen manager  two assistant kitchen managers  and two assistant general managers 
a majority of the managers at buca di beppo and vinny t s of boston restaurants participate in the paisano partner program 
under the paisano partner program  the restaurant management team is paid based on the results and profits of its restaurant on a monthly  quarterly and annual basis 
the paisano partner also receives stock options and is required to purchase between  and  of our common stock at the time of employment in the position 
during fiscal  we also implemented a phantom stock plan  which gives our paisano partners and certain additional restaurant management personnel the right to receive cash payments during based on the value of our common stock 
see note to the financial statements for additional detail on the phantom stock plan 
kitchen managers also receive stock options 
each member of our restaurant management team is cross trained in all operational areas 
the majority of our buca di beppo restaurants are open seven days a week  typically opening at pm during the week and noon on the weekends and closing at pm on weekdays and pm on weekends 
all vinny t s of boston restaurants are open for lunch and dinner seven days a week from am to am on weekdays and am to am on weekends 
recruiting and training we actively recruit  hire  and promote qualified individuals who demonstrate a commitment to guest service 
it is our policy to promote from within  whenever possible 
our competitive compensation plan for restaurant management features a base salary and competitive benefits package  including a k plan 
we also offer a management incentive plan that rewards restaurant management teams for achieving financial objectives 
our comprehensive hiring and training process features a series of interviews and tests  including a recently implemented  computerized program that strengthens our ability to test  select  train  and support personnel at all levels of the organization 
we expect this system to enhance the quality and consistency of our training programs  and to simultaneously reduce the overall cost of those programs 
all new restaurant employees receive extensive training to enable them to excel in their respective positions 
those programs include on the job training and  for certain positions  classroom instruction 
each employee s progress is measured through a validation process at pre determined stages within the training period 

index to financial statements each new member of the restaurant management team participates in a six week training program that includes kitchen training and a minimum of one week at buca university buca u  our corporate training center in the paisano support center in minneapolis 
the buca u program includes interactive classroom instruction led by members of the corporate management team  hands on training in our maple grove  minnesota restaurant  dinner at the original restaurant in downtown minneapolis  and a quality review session in one of the twin cities buca di beppo restaurants 
additional training tools are available  including comprehensive employee training manuals featuring our procedures  standards  controls  and food line management systems 
our food culture manual is designed to complement training received at all levels 
most training materials for in store personnel are available in both english and spanish 
marketing our marketing funds are allocated between the buca di beppo and vinny t s brands approximately in proportion to their respective revenue contributions 
we use a majority of these funds on newspaper and targeted direct mail 
in fiscal  we hired two new advertising agencies one for each brand and engaged a field marketing agency  a public relations agency and several specialized marketing groups for our marketing programs in fiscal and one important marketing initiative during fiscal was the introduction of eclub  an internet based program that is designed to increase customer loyalty and drive repeat business for both brands 
we also began promoting our central reservation system and the use of our toll free reservation number  eat buca  to enhance use of reservations 
we also encourage our paisano partners to involve themselves in the community to maximize the return on local advertising  public and community relations 
our marketing strategy is based upon accomplishing several key marketing objectives 
with regard to the buca di beppo brand  our primary goals are to improve overall brand awareness  gain acceptance from new users  improve average frequency of visit  and enhance the image of buca di beppo as a premier italian dining destination 
we are a multi market chain operating in about markets 
in order to increase awareness and brand acceptance  we employ a range of national and local media  including usa today national edition  major market newspapers  neighborhood papers  targeted direct mail  eclub and other local marketing support such as radio and public relations programs 
our messages focus heavily on the quality of our food  which was perceived to be near the top of our industry  according to an april study completed by an independent research firm retained and paid for by us 
during fiscal  we introduced buca small  which is a smaller and less expensive version of our flagship family style dining 
we believe that buca small has allowed our guests to experience more variety from our menu during their visits  enhancing the guest experience and increasing guest counts and average frequency of visit 
for our vinny t s of boston brand  which is heavily concentrated in the boston area  we are focusing on improving the perception of vinny t s as the choice for the highest quality food 
we are also focusing on the fact that we have a large variety of menu selections  including traditional italian items  as well as steaks  chops and seafood 
to do so  we employ newspaper  direct mail  radio  eclub and local store marketing 
since vinny t s is a regional chain  we do not engage in any national advertising for this brand 
purchasing we strive to obtain high quality menu ingredients and other supplies and services for our operations from reliable sources at competitive prices 
to this end  we continually research and evaluate various ingredients and products in an effort to maintain the highest quality and to be responsive to changing consumer tastes 
our food and beverage department and the centralized purchasing staff specify the products to be used at our restaurants  designate the vendors and provide suppliers with detailed ingredient specifications 
to maximize purchasing efficiencies and to provide for the freshest ingredients for our menu items  each restaurant s management team determines the quantity of food and supplies required 
to obtain the lowest possible prices for the required high 
index to financial statements quality and consistent raw ingredients  each restaurant orders items primarily from our national food distributor  sysco corporation  on terms negotiated by our centralized purchasing staff 
our contract with sysco expires in we believe that all essential food and beverage products are available from several qualified suppliers at competitive prices should an alternative source be required 
new restaurant site selection and development from fiscal to  we pursued a rapid expansion strategy  opening buca di beppo restaurants in each of fiscal and  and in each of fiscal and in january  we purchased the assets of nine vinny t s of boston restaurants 
in fiscal  we slowed our development  opening three restaurants and closing two  and have focused on the development and implementation of appropriate strategies to improve our comparable restaurant sales trends 
in january  we opened one buca di beppo restaurant in california 
we have also decided not to develop two potential locations where leases had been executed and do not expect to open any additional restaurants for the remainder of fiscal or in fiscal we anticipate over the next several years that the majority of our new restaurants will be in existing markets 
opening restaurants in existing markets enables us to increase our operational  marketing and recruiting efficiencies 
our site selection process is critical to our success and we anticipate devoting substantial effort to evaluating each potential site 
our real estate advisory committee reviews each new location 
the real estate advisory committee consists of our chief executive officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  chief marketing officer  general counsel  regional management for the area involved  and two of our non employee directors 
the selection process includes identifying target markets that meet our demographic requirements and targeted minimum return on assets 
our leases are typically years in length with four five year option periods 
we also look to receive tenant allowance from our landlords to offset our development costs 
in the past  we have purchased land as we found suitable locations 
in the future  we may refinance any purchases of land or buildings through sale leaseback transactions 
we cannot predict whether this financing will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
we are flexible in the types of locations where we can develop a restaurant 
we have locations in both urban and suburban locations  including regional shopping malls  in line shopping centers  retail and entertainment centers  office buildings and freestanding buildings in commercial and residential neighborhoods 
in fiscal  our new buca di beppo or vinny t s of boston leased restaurants required  on average  a total cash investment of approximately million 
information technology we utilize a centralized network to collect information  maintain technical controls and support all our restaurants 
a call center located at our paisano support center answers the telephone and takes reservations during the day for buca di beppo restaurants 
all of our restaurants use personal computer systems integrated with management systems to monitor restaurant sales  product costs and labor costs on a daily basis 
financial controls are maintained through a centralized accounting system  which includes a sophisticated theoretical food cost program and a labor scheduling and tracking program 
physical inventories of food and beverage items are taken on a weekly basis 
daily  weekly and monthly financial information is provided to management for analysis and comparison to our budget and to historical information 
we closely monitor restaurant sales  cost of sales  labor and other restaurant trends on a daily  weekly and monthly basis 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees  which included administrative and executive personnel  and restaurant management personnel  the remainder being hourly restaurant personnel 

index to financial statements none of our employees is covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage or strike 
we believe that our working conditions and compensation packages are competitive  and we strive to create a working environment which reflects our principles and values of justice  hospitality and excellence 
intellectual property we have registered with the united states patent and trademark office the service marks buca  beppo  buca di beppo  buca di beppo stylized  buca di beppo design  vinny testa s  vinny testa s design  vinny t s of boston  mama buca i design  mama buca ii design  pouring chianti bottle design  cherubs and bowl design  curtain design and smoking cherub design 
we also have a pending trademark application with the united states patent and trademark office for buca to go 
in addition  we have trademark registrations for buca and buca di beppo in the following countries benelux  denmark  finland  germany  iceland  ireland  norway  sweden  and the united kingdom 
we believe that our trademarks  service marks  trade dress and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to the marketing of our restaurant concepts 
we have in the past protected our proprietary rights and expect to continue to vigorously protect those rights in the future 
we cannot predict  however  whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation and or infringement of these rights or the use by others of restaurant features based upon  or otherwise similar to  our overall concepts 
it may be difficult for us to prevent others from copying discrete elements of our concepts and any litigation to enforce our rights will likely be costly 
in addition  other local restaurant operations may claim that our name is confusingly similar to their names and may try to prevent us from using our marks in those locales 
our history the buca di beppo concept was created in minneapolis in and originally operated by a company owned by philip a 
roberts  don w 
hays and peter j 
mihajlov 
on december   parasole restaurant holdings  inc  a diversified restaurant company operating in the minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan area  acquired this company 
messrs 
roberts and mihajlov are the principal shareholders of parasole 
from january through september  we operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of parasole 
on september   we were spun off from parasole through a share dividend of our common stock pro rata among the parasole shareholders to create a better vehicle for obtaining financing for our expansion plans 
in  we had our initial public offering of stock and became a public company 
in january  we purchased the assets of the nine vinny t s of boston restaurants  formerly known as vinny testa s italian american restaurant 
the vinny t s of boston concept was established in boston in competition the restaurant industry is intensely competitive 
we compete on the basis of taste  quality  price of food offered  guest service  location  ambiance and overall dining experience 
we have many well established competitors  both nationally and locally owned italian and non italian concepts  with substantially greater financial resources and a longer history of operations than we do 
their resources and market presence may provide advantages in marketing  purchasing and negotiating leases 
we compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for sites and finding management personnel 
changes in consumer tastes  economic conditions  demographic trends and the location and number of  and type of food served by  competing restaurants could adversely affect our business  as could the unavailability of experienced management and hourly employees 
government regulations our restaurants are subject to regulation by federal agencies and to licensing and regulation by state and local health  sanitation  building  zoning  safety  fire and other departments relating to the development and operation of restaurants 
these regulations include matters relating to environmental  building  construction and zoning requirements and the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages 
our facilities are licensed and subject to regulation under state and local fire  health and safety codes 

index to financial statements each of our restaurants is required to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises from a state authority and  in certain locations  county and or municipal authorities 
typically  licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time 
alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of each of our restaurants  including minimum age of patrons and employees  hours of operation  advertising  wholesale purchasing  inventory control and handling  and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages 
the failure to receive or retain a liquor license in a particular location could adversely affect that restaurant and our ability to obtain such a license elsewhere 
we are subject to dram shop statutes in the states in which our restaurants are located 
these statutes generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated individual 
we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance  which we believe is consistent with coverage carried by other entities in the restaurant industry 
although we are covered by insurance  a judgment against us under a dram shop statute in excess of our liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on us 
our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages  working conditions  citizenship requirements and overtime 
some states have set minimum wage requirements higher than the federal level 
significant numbers of hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage and  accordingly  increases in the minimum wage will increase labor costs 
we are also subject to the americans with disability act of  which  among other things  may require certain renovations to our restaurants to meet federally mandated requirements 
the cost of any such renovations is not expected to materially affect us

risk factors we may be unable to return to profitability or raise additional capital although we have been profitable in the past  we lost million in fiscal and million in fiscal we cannot predict whether we will be able to achieve revenue growth  generate positive cash flows or return to profitability in the future 
we have entered into long term leases for many of our restaurants  which limits our ability to either close individual restaurant locations or improve their operating cash flow 
our current credit facility also limits our ability to build new restaurants  which has contributed to our decision to slow down our future development plans and develop a revised plan to improve our core business through improving our comparable restaurant sales and margins 
failure to achieve these objectives may cause our stock price to decline and make it difficult to raise additional capital 
restrictive covenants in our credit facility could have a material adverse affect on our business our credit facility contains restrictive covenants and requirements that we comply with certain financial ratios 
these covenants limit our ability to take various actions without the consent of our lenders  including the incurrence of additional debt  the guaranteeing of certain indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions  including mergers and sales of assets  paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments  including investments 
these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of business opportunities 
in addition  failure to maintain the covenants required by our credit facility could result in acceleration of our indebtedness 
as of the end of fiscal  we were in violation of certain covenants under the credit facility  which were subsequently waived by the lenders 
our inability in the future to comply with the covenant requirements 
index to financial statements under the credit facility and to obtain a waiver of such violations could impair our liquidity and limit our ability to operate 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our credit facility and the covenant requirements 
we may be unable to achieve and maintain favorable comparable restaurant sales results improvements in comparable restaurant sales are a key measure of financial health for our overall company as well as for our individual restaurants 
we have experienced a decline in comparable restaurant sales in each year since fiscal for our buca di beppo restaurants and since fiscal for our vinny t s of boston restaurants 
although we have seen improvements in comparable restaurant sales for both brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the same period last year  there can be no assurance that we will continue to see improvements in comparable restaurant sales in the future 
if we are unable to achieve and maintain positive comparable restaurant sales  we may incur asset impairment charges for restaurants that have operating losses and or negative cash flows and we may close those restaurants  which could result in significant exit costs  including lease termination costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the asset impairment charges that we have taken in fiscal  and  and for a discussion of the lease termination costs that we incurred in fiscal an unfavorable finding in the ongoing sec investigation could have a material adverse effect on us as previously disclosed  we are the subject of an ongoing sec investigation 
we have cooperated with this investigation both before and after issuance of the formal order of investigation in february we understand that the order of investigation relates to our internal controls and compliance with rules governing filings and reports  including public disclosures  required to be filed with the sec  and the purchase of an old farmhouse in italy known as villa sermenino 
we are cooperating and assisting with the sec s investigation in order to bring the inquiry to a conclusion as promptly as possible 
we are unable to predict the ultimate focus or outcome of the investigation  or when it will be completed 
any unfavorable finding from the sec as a result of the investigation could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of the sec s investigation 
the costs of recent internal investigations  the sec investigation and changing corporate governance will result in significant additional expenses the costs of completing our recent internal investigations  including related expenses such as penalties paid to certain of our investors under the terms of our securities purchase agreement  dated as of february   the costs of the on going sec investigation and the costs of compliance with more stringent corporate governance standards is expected to be significant and material to our business 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  our efforts to cooperate with the sec investigation and to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment have required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
in addition  it has become more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we have purchased coverage at substantially higher cost than in the past 
because of our recent investigations  we can make no assurance that director and officer liability insurance will be available to us at any cost 
further instances of breakdowns in our internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on us we maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting that is reviewed and monitored by our management and our audit committee and tested by an independent internal audit consulting firm 
as of the end 
index to financial statements of fiscal  our management has identified certain material weaknesses in our system of internal controls 
these material weaknesses are discussed in detail in item a 
controls and procedures 
while significant changes in executive personnel were made during fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal  our company has suffered in the past from an inappropriate tone set by former senior executives and a lack of a demonstrable commitment by former senior executives to set high standards of ethics  integrity  accounting and corporate governance 
our board of directors and current management believe that these inappropriate attitudes and deeds of former senior executives led to an environment where strong systems of internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures were not supported 
we have taken remedial measures to correct such control deficiencies 
we have devoted significant resources to document  test  monitor and improve our internal controls and will continue to do so  however  we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our controls are adequate in the future or that adequate controls will be effective in preventing fraud 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on our stock price 
we may be unable to fund our significant future capital needs and we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated we may need substantial capital to finance our operations  which require funds for capital expenditures  pre opening costs and potential initial operating losses related to new restaurant openings 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we will have to curtail projected growth  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
moreover  if we issue additional equity securities  the holdings of existing shareholders may be diluted 
although we expect that borrowings under our credit facility  combined with other resources  will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements at least through fiscal  this may not be the case 
our credit facility limits our capital expenditures in future years  including a maximum of million in fiscal  subject to the satisfaction of certain bank covenants 
we may be required to seek additional capital earlier than anticipated if future actual cash flows from operations fail to meet our expectations  costs and capital expenditures for new restaurant development exceed anticipated amounts  landlord contributions  loans and other incentives are lower than expected the costs of our internal investigation  the sec investigation  the derivative lawsuit and other related litigation exceed anticipated amounts  we are required to reduce prices to respond to competitive pressures  or we are unable to achieve the required bank covenants 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our historical and anticipated capital needs 
competition may adversely affect our operations and financial results the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to price  service  restaurant location and food quality  and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  economic conditions  population  and traffic patterns 
we compete within each market with locally owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains  some of which operate more restaurants and have greater financial resources and longer 
index to financial statements operating histories than we do 
there is active competition for management personnel and for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants 
if we are unable to effectively compete within the restaurant industry  our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
see item business competition for a discussion of the competition we face 
complaints  litigation  governmental investigations and the related adverse publicity may materially adversely affect us we are from time to time the subject of complaints or litigation from guests alleging illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
these claims may divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations 
in march  two of our former hourly employees filed a purported class action suit against us in the orange county superior court  state of california 
the action was later transferred to the los angeles superior court  state of california  where it is currently pending 
the complaint alleges causes of action for failure to pay wages overtime  failure to allow meal breaks  failure to allow rest breaks  failure to pay reporting time pay  violation of california business professions code section  and certain statutory damages and penalties 
mediation occurred in february  at which time the parties reached a tentative settlement 
the settlement has not yet been approved by the court 
the proposed settlement structure is expected to result in a liability which we currently estimate to be between and million 
the actual amount under the proposed settlement structure will be dependent on how many members of the putative class file timely claims  assuming judicial approval 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on estimates received from external legal counsel  we recorded an estimated settlement expense of million associated with this legal action 
this expense amount is included in general and administrative expense 
while we know of no other similar lawsuits threatened against us in any other jurisdiction  we can make no assurance that similar lawsuits will not be filed against us in the future 
any such lawsuits that are filed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our company  as nominal defendant  our five directors  and three of our former officers have been named as defendants in purported derivative actions that were filed in april in the hennepin county district court  state of minnesota 
the actions have been consolidated under the title in re buca  inc shareholder derivative litigation 
a consolidated complaint has been filed by two shareholders who allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties by ignoring  and failing to correct  problems with the company s financial accounting and internal controls 
the plaintiffs seek compensatory damages from the individual defendants for losses allegedly sustained by the company  which include the costs of internal investigations and an sec investigation 
the plaintiffs also seek unspecified equitable relief and an award of attorneys fees and costs of litigation 
the defendants have not yet responded to the consolidated complaint 
we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation  but it may be costly and disruptive 
the total costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
derivative litigation can result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations  including cash flows 
see also an unfavorable finding in the ongoing sec investigation could have a material adverse effect on us above for a description of an on going sec investigation 
multi unit restaurant businesses can also be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality  food borne illness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants 
in particular  since we depend heavily on the brands buca di beppo and vinny t s of boston for all of our revenues  unfavorable publicity relating to one or more buca di beppo or vinny t s of boston restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our senior management team has a limited history of working together our success depends  in large part  upon the services of our senior management team 
all of our senior management team  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  has been in place for less 
index to financial statements than months with all but two in place for less than six months 
although experienced in the restaurant industry  these executives do not have previous experience with us and we cannot assure you that they will fully integrate themselves into our business or that they will manage effectively our growth 
our failure to assimilate these new executives  the failure of these new executives to perform effectively  or the loss of any of these new executives  could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we do not carry key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
fluctuations in our operating results may result in decreases in our stock price our operating results will fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  profitability of new restaurants  timing of unexpected charges  general economic conditions  seasonality of restaurant sales  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  impairment of restaurant assets  changes in interest rates  competitive factors and weather conditions 
as a result  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our historical operating results 
inflation could materially adversely affect our operating results the majority of our operating expenses have increased due to inflation 
we have tried to offset these increases in operating expenses by increasing menu prices or by implementing other cost reduction procedures that has limited the overall impact from inflation 
because we are in a competitive industry  we may be limited in the amount of menu prices we can increase 
if we are unable to offset increases in operating expenses due to inflation  it could be materially adversely affect or business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
increased food costs could materially adversely affect our operating results our operating results depend in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
we rely on sysco corporation  a national food distributor  as the primary distributor of our food 
our contract with sysco expires in although we believe that alternative distribution sources are available  any increase in distribution prices  inability to negotiate a new distribution contract or failure to perform by sysco could cause our food costs to increase 
further  various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions and governmental regulation  may affect our food costs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could negatively impact our results our restaurants feature italian cuisine served primarily in small and large family style portions 
our continued success depends  in part  upon the popularity of this type of italian cuisine and this style of informal dining 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our cuisine or dining style could materially adversely affect our future profitability 
also  our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
our business may also be affected by changes in consumer tastes and the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet  nutrition and health 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
our restaurant operations are influenced by weather conditions weather  which is unpredictable  can adversely impact our sales 
harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants 
a heavy snowstorm can leave an entire 
index to financial statements metropolitan area snowbound  resulting in a reduction in sales 
for these reasons  a quarter to quarter comparison may not be a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future 
our operations depend on governmental licenses and complying with government regulations each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control  health  sanitation  safety and fire agencies in the state  county and or municipality in which the restaurant is located 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals 
if we fail to hold all necessary licenses  we may be forced to delay or cancel new restaurant openings and close or reduce operations at existing locations 
we also are subject to federal and state environmental regulations and adverse changes in these regulations could have a material negative effect on our operations 
for example  more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 
we are subject to the fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions  along with the americans with disabilities act  various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted  or rules and regulations promulgated  by federal  state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters 
a material increase in the minimum wage and other statutory benefits could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the americans with disabilities act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment 
although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled  we could be required to reconfigure our restaurants to provide service to  or make reasonable accommodations for  disabled persons 
such modifications could require us to spend substantial amounts of money 
we may face liability under dram shop statutes our sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to dram shop statutes in most states 
these statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person 
if we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage  or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage  our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
see item business government regulation for a discussion of the regulations we must comply with 
we could face potential labor shortages and increases in labor costs our success depends in part upon our ability to attract  motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  including restaurant managers  kitchen staff and wait staff  necessary to keep pace with our expansion schedule 
qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in certain areas  and the inability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient employees  which could result in higher labor costs 
in addition  we have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid the federal or state minimum wage and who rely on tips for a significant portion of their income 
government mandated increases in minimum wages  overtime pay  paid leaves of absence  or health benefits  or increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities  or a reduction in the number of states that allow tips to be credited toward minimum wage requirements  could increase our labor costs and reduce our operating margins 
increased energy costs and power outages may adversely affect our operating results our success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs 
various regions of the united states in which we operate multiple restaurants  particularly california  have experienced significant and 
index to financial statements temporary increases in utility prices 
we have in the past closed restaurants on a temporary basis due to the inability to receive electrical power 
if these increases should recur  it may adversely affect our operating results 
we may suffer from uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business we have comprehensive insurance  including general liability  fire  extended coverage and employee practices liability coverage 
however  there are certain types of losses that may be uninsurable or that we believe are not economically insurable  such as earthquakes  other natural disasters  and terrorist attacks 
in view of the location of many of our existing and planned restaurants in california and other earthquake prone areas of the united states  our operations are susceptible to damage and disruption caused by earthquakes 
in the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster affecting one or more geographic areas of our operations  we could suffer a loss of the capital invested in  as well as anticipated earnings from  the damaged or destroyed properties 
the terrorist attacks on the united states had a significant impact on the portion of our business that is celebratory in nature and adversely affected our restaurant sales and profitability 
with the threats of additional terrorists attacks and continuing uncertainty created by the war on terrorism  there could be a potential downturn in the economy and a decrease in consumer spending 
these factors  as well as the effects of adverse publicity to our business  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to expand in a timely and profitable manner during fiscal  we opened a total of three new restaurants and closed a total of two 
this reflects a reduction in our expansion activities relative to our history 
while we expect to add only one new restaurant in and no new restaurants in  we do expect to resume growth by adding new restaurants in fiscal and beyond 
to grow successfully through new store additions  we must open new buca di beppo and vinny t s of boston restaurants on a timely and profitable basis 
we have experienced delays in restaurant openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future 
delays or failures in opening new restaurants could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
our ability to expand successfully will depend on a number of factors  some of which are not entirely within our control  including the identification and availability of suitable restaurant sites  competition for restaurant sites  negotiation of favorable leases  timely development in certain cases of commercial  residential  street or highway construction near our restaurants  management of construction and development costs of new restaurants  securing of required governmental approvals  permits and licenses  recruitment of qualified operating personnel  particularly paisano partners and kitchen managers  competition in new markets  limitations under our credit facility  and general economic conditions 
in addition  we may enter new markets in which we have no operating experience 
these new markets may have different demographic characteristics  competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets  which may cause our new restaurants to be less successful in these new markets than in our existing markets 
furthermore  a sustained history of significant operating losses at a restaurant could result in a charge for impairment of assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the asset impairment criteria and note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the asset impairment charges that we have taken in fiscal  and

to date  none of this litigation  some of which is covered by insurance  has had a material effect on us 
in march  two of our former hourly employees filed a purported class action suit against us in the orange county superior court  state of california 
the action was later transferred to the los angeles superior court  state of california  where it is currently pending 
the complaint alleges causes of action for failure to pay wages overtime  failure to allow meal breaks  failure to allow rest breaks  failure to pay reporting time pay  violation of business professions code section  and certain statutory damages and penalties 
mediation occurred in february  at which time the parties reached a tentative settlement 
the settlement has not yet been approved by the court 
the proposed settlement structure is expected to result in an estimated liability between and million 
the actual amount under the proposed settlement structure will be dependent on how many members of the putative class file timely claims  assuming judicial approval 
during the fourth quarter of  based on estimates received from external legal counsel  we recorded an estimated settlement expense of million associated with this legal action 
this expense amount is included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying financial statements 
in february  we announced that the sec had informed us that it has issued a formal order of investigation to determine whether there have been violations of the federal securities laws 
we understand that the order of investigation relates to our internal controls and compliance with rules governing filings and reports  including public disclosures  required to be filed with the sec  and the purchase of an old farmhouse in italy known as villa sermenino 
we are cooperating and assisting with the sec s investigation in order to bring the inquiry to a conclusion as promptly as possible 
our company  as nominal defendant  our five directors  and three of our former officers have been named as defendants in purported derivative actions that were filed in april in the hennepin county district court  state of minnesota 
the actions have been consolidated under the title in re buca  inc shareholder derivative litigation 
a consolidated complaint has been filed by two shareholders who allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties by ignoring  and failing to correct  problems with the company s financial accounting and internal controls 
the plaintiffs seek compensatory damages from the individual defendants for losses allegedly sustained by the company  which include the costs of internal investigations and an sec investigation 
the plaintiffs also seek unspecified equitable relief and an award of attorneys fees and costs of litigation 
the defendants have not yet responded to the consolidated complaint 
we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation  but it may be costly and disruptive 
the total costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
derivative litigation can result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations  including cash flows 
on july   we filed a civil action against two of our former officers  greg gadel and john motschenbacher  in the hennepin county district court  minneapolis  minnesota 
gadel was our chief financial officer until february motschenbacher was an officer since  and our senior vice president and chief information officer from february until march  in the complaint  we allege that gadel and motschenbacher breached the fiduciary duties of loyalty  good faith  and due care that they owed to us during their tenure as officers  and unjustly enriched themselves  by causing us to enter into unfavorable transactions with companies in which gadel and motschenbacher had undisclosed  material financial interests  causing us to overpay for goods and services provided by vendors in which gadel and motschenbacher had undisclosed  
index to financial statements material financial interests  soliciting and receiving undisclosed kickbacks from a vendor  and seeking and receiving improper reimbursement from us for business expenses that were  in fact  personal in nature  such as family vacations 
we seek damages against each of gadel and motschenbacher in an amount in excess of  disgorgement of the compensation that we paid to gadel and motschenbacher during the period that they were faithless fiduciaries  reimbursement of our costs of investigation  and an award of interest  attorneys fees  and costs of litigation

losses on impairment of long lived assets primarily include asset impairment charges taken for both open and unopened restaurants 
the asset impairment of fixed and other long term assets for certain open restaurants was taken because the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows of such restaurants did not support the net book value of the related restaurant assets 
the write off of capitalized development costs for certain unopened restaurants was taken because of a reduction in our development plans 
loss on impairment of goodwill in fiscal related to the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of nine vinny t s of boston restaurants in january management determined that the goodwill amount recorded in connection with the purchase was unrecoverable based on its estimate of the fair value of these restaurants

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investigations an investigation by our audit committee undertaken with the assistance of independent counsel in the second quarter of fiscal revealed that our former chairman and chief executive officer  joe micatrotto  had used company funds for purposes that were either personal in nature  not properly authorized  or insufficiently documented as proper business expenditures 
after the investigation was concluded  we sought and received mr 
micatrotto s resignation and entered into a separation agreement and an agreement for waiver and release of keysop benefits with mr 
micatrotto  pursuant to which mr 
micatrotto agreed  among other things  
index to financial statements to make certain cash payments to us and to waive all rights to receive any payments under our key employee share option plan  including both vested and unvested benefits 
these agreements resulted in a total recoupment to us of approximately  the audit committee investigation also indicated that certain other former executive officers incurred travel  entertainment  and other expenses of a lesser amount that were questionable  not properly authorized  or insufficiently documented as business expenses 
we have taken steps to ensure compliance with our expense report documentation guidelines and added new requirements  where appropriate 
in february  we announced that the sec had informed us that it had issued a formal order of investigation to determine whether there have been violations of the federal securities laws 
we believe that the investigation may have been initiated by mr 
micatrotto s resignation and we understand that the order of investigation relates to our internal controls and compliance with rules governing filings and reports  including public disclosures  required to be filed with the sec  and the purchase of an old farmhouse in italy known as villa sermenino 
in march  we announced that we had terminated the employment of our vice president  controller  and interim chief financial officer  daniel j 
skrypek  and our senior vice president and chief information officer  john j 
motschenbacher 
acting through our audit committee with the assistance of independent counsel  we then commenced an internal investigation of matters relating to the termination of these two executive officers 
as part of its investigation  independent counsel to the audit committee  with the assistance of forensic accountants  examined  among other things  manual journal entries in our accounting records  capitalization of fixed assets in connection with new restaurants being developed in prior years  and potential related party transactions with certain vendors 
the results of the internal investigation led to the need to make further corrections to our financial statements  including corrections related to the classification of certain consulting fees  certain contributions by vendors to our annual paisano partner conference and certain management expenses  as detailed in the section entitled restatement of prior financial information below
