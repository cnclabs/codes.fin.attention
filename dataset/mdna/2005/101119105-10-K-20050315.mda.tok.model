the cost of deposits declined basis points to during due to the mix of deposits and the banks not raising their rates on interest bearing deposit accounts and cd s in direct proportion to the rise in short term interest rates

these firms offer wealth advisory capabilities which boston private considers to be an important component of the company s regionally based wealth management strategy 
wealth advisory adds profitable fee income to boston private s revenue base that is more resistant to fluctuations in market conditions in comparison to investment management businesses since financial planning fees are usually not tied to the market value of assets under management

the decrease in the refinance market activity in reduced the amount of mortgage loans that were available for sale 
the gain on sale of investments is a function of the banks liquidity needs and asset liability management 
iii 
growth boston private is pursuing what management believes is an attractive opportunity 
following is a description of the company s target markets 
high net worth households 
boston private considers high net worth households to be those with at least million of investable assets 
boston private considers these high net worth individuals and their families to be newly affluent  with wealth created after world war ii  and or wealth in transition where control of family wealth has recently been passed to the next generation  and or established wealth where families have been preserving wealth over generations 
institutions intermediaries 
boston private considers corporate defined benefit plans  defined contribution plans and profit sharing plans and subadvisory relationships to be attractive target clients in the institutional marketplace 
additionally  our affiliates also target small businesses with approximately million to million in annual sales 
key intermediaries include lawyers  venture capital firms and accountants as they provide access to clients who by nature of their businesses often require complex and comprehensive financial services 
foundations endowments 
boston private considers private public foundations and endowments of at least million to be attractive clients to target for wealth management services 
in addition to servicing the foundations and endowments directly  the company seeks to access additional high net worth individuals that manage and advise these organizations 
boston private s mission is to build a national wealth management enterprise that delivers a comprehensive set of financial services on a local platform 
to achieve these results  the company has identified three key growth objectives 
growth by acquisitions 
the company has identified top geographies in the united states where it plans to form clusters of financial services companies that meet the private banking  investment management and wealth advisory requirements of the wealth management marketplace 
by forming clusters of companies  boston private seeks to replicate the success it has achieved in new england and northern california 
the company s bank supervisory and regulatory authorities regulate any acquisitions the company seeks to make  and in many cases  approval by these authorities is required prior to the consummation of such acquisitions 
boston private and its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to the supervision  examination  reporting and regulatory requirements of the bhca and the regulations of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines which it uses in assessing the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications upon which it acts 
the federal reserve board s capital adequacy guidelines generally require bank holding companies to maintain total capital equal to of total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items  with at least of that amount consisting of tier i or core capital and the remaining amount consisting of tier ii or supplementary capital 
tier i capital for bank holding companies generally consists of the sum of common stockholders equity and perpetual preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures subject to certain limitations  less goodwill and other non qualifying intangible assets 
when the company makes acquisitions  especially investment management and wealth advisory firms  a significant portion of the purchase price will typically be allocated to goodwill and intangible assets  particularly investment advisory contracts 
tier i capital is reduced for these intangible assets 
accordingly  the company must consider both capital adequacy as well as cash availability in order to consummate any acquisitions 
this is a constraint that is not applicable to many of the company s competitors in the marketplace and could negatively impact the company s ability to execute on its acquisition strategy in a timely and efficient manner 
organic growth 
net new sales are critical to each affiliate achieving its growth goals 
by investing in additional capabilities that add to core strengths  boston private and its affiliates are focused on building critical mass within each regional cluster and investing in activities that promote organic growth  such as adding complementary products services 
where possible  the company will seek to capitalize on synergies and cross selling opportunities within these regional clusters  but these efforts are not expected to be critical drivers of the company s growth 
affiliate management by boston private 
the management of boston private has structured the governance of its affiliate enterprise to promote autonomy and independence in its affiliates 
the company expects each affiliate to meet the highest level of corporate governance mandates and expects each affiliate to adhere to the operational standards of the highly regulated financial services industry 
in summary  boston private operates in a rapidly growing and competitive wealth management market 
by acquiring quality firms and growing these businesses organically  the company seeks to provide financial services capabilities that meet all stages of the wealth management financial lifecycle 
iv 
financial condition a 
liquidity liquidity is defined as the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers as well as to earnings enhancement opportunities in a changing marketplace 
below are the schedules of the company s contractual obligations and commitments as of december  december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations federal home loan bank borrowings    junior subordinated debentures   operating lease obligations     deferred acquisition obligations     bonus and commissions      data processing   other long term obligations    total contractual obligations at december    december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands other commitments lines of credit and commitments to originate loans   standby letters of credit     standby repurchase obligations   forward commitments to sell loans   total commitments      management is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity targets as well as strategies to meet these targets 
in general  the company maintains a relatively high degree of liquidity 
at december   consolidated cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and securities available for sale amounted to million  or of total assets of the company 
liquidity at the holding company level should also be considered separately from the consolidated liquidity since there are restrictions on the ability of the banking affiliates to distribute funds to the holding company 
the holding company s primary sources of funds are dividends from its subsidiaries  proceeds from the issuance of its common stock  a committed line of credit with an unaffiliated bank  and access to the money and capital markets 
during  the company renegotiated its existing line of credit with a correspondent bank 
the amount available to borrow under the resulting line of credit was increased from million to million 
the purpose of the line of credit is to provide short term working capital to the company and its subsidiaries  if necessary 
the interest rate on the line of credit is a floating rate indexed to either the prime rate or the federal funds rate  as selected by the company 
the company is required to maintain various minimum capital and loan loss ratios in conjunction with the revolving credit agreement 
as of december   the company was in compliance with these covenants and there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
the company utilized this line of credit in to fund working capital requirements which were impacted by the business acquisitions 
in the short term  management anticipates the cost of borrowing under the line of credit will be lower than the cost of accessing the capital markets to issue additional common stock 
however  it may be necessary to raise capital to meet regulatory requirements even though it would be less expensive to borrow the cash needed 
in october  the company raised approximately million by issuing convertible trust preferred debt securities 
a portion of the proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of encino and kls  and the remainder will be used to fund future acquisitions 
the convertible trust preferred securities have a liquidation amount of per security  pay interest quarterly and have a fixed distribution rate of 
the quarterly distributions are cumulative 
the junior subordinated convertible debentures will mature on october  the trust preferred securities may be converted into common stock of the company if certain conditions are met
