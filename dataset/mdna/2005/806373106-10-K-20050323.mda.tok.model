the company is a service business whose major cost is employees labor 
material purchases are limited to supplies incidental to the services provided 
the company expects to fund future contractual obligations through funds generated from operations  together with general company financing transactions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
the company s clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers  converters and advertising agencies  none of which individually represent more than of total revenue 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in the portfolio 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective in  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
other intangible assets that meet certain criteria continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are also subject to an impairment test based on estimated undiscounted cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate 
table of contents using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
the company performed the required impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in  and it was determined appropriate to consider the company to be one reporting unit for purposes of this test 
customer rebates 
the company has rebate agreements with certain customers 
the agreements offer discount pricing based on volume over a multi year period 
the company accrues the estimated rebates over the term of the agreement  reducing revenue and crediting a current liability account 
at the end of the rebate accounting period  typically annually  the rebate is settled in cash and the accrued liability account is charged 
the company accounts for changes in the estimated rebate amounts as soon as it has determined that the estimated sales for the rebate period have changed 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and net operating losses will not be realized 
the company  like other multi national companies  is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
accordingly  tax reserves have been recorded when  in management s judgment  it is not probable that the company s tax position will ultimately be sustained 
while predicting the outcome of the audits involves uncertainty and requires estimates and informed judgments  we believe that the recorded tax liabilities are adequate and appropriate 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretation of regulations 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these events occur or when the statute of limitations for a specific exposure item has expired 
restructuring reserves 
the company records reserves for the operational restructuring of acquired companies 
the restructuring plans are approved by company management prior to  or shortly after  the acquisition date and may be modified during the twelve month period following the acquisition  as conditions change 
the restructuring plans provide for severance pay  lease abandonment costs and other expenses 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r revised december  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement requires that the fair value at the grant date resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
further  sfas r requires entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for these transactions 
this value is recorded over the vesting period 
this statement is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the provisions of sfas r  and the impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
impact of inflation the company believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure the company has million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  and expects to use its variable rate credit facilities during and beyond to fund acquisitions and cash flow needs 
assuming interest rate volatility in the future similar to what has been seen in recent years  the company does 
table of contents not anticipate that short term changes in interest rates will materially affect its consolidated financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 
a increase in short term interest rates would add of interest cost annually  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december  foreign exchange exposure the company has foreign operations that expose it to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to us dollars 
since changes in translation risk are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity  a change in the foreign exchange rate would not have material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
