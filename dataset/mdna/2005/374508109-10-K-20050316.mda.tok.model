item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we refine and sell petroleum products and operate service stations and convenience stores 
our operations are divided into three strategic business units  the refining group  the retail group and phoenix fuel 
the refining group operates two refineries in the four corners area of new mexico and one refinery in yorktown  virginia 
the refining group sells its products to numerous wholesale distributors and retail chains 
our retail group operated service stations at december  the retail group sells petroleum products and merchandise in new mexico  arizona  and southern colorado 
phoenix fuel distributes commercial wholesale petroleum products primarily in arizona 
in order to maintain and improve our financial performance  we are focused on several critical and challenging objectives 
we will be addressing these objectives in the short term as well as over the next three to five years 
in our view  the most important of these objectives are increasing margins through management of inventories and taking advantage of sales and purchasing opportunities  minimizing or reducing operating expenses and capital expenditures  increasing the available crude oil supply for our four corners refineries  
table of contents cost effectively complying with current environmental regulations as they apply to our refineries  including future clean air standards  improving our overall financial health and flexibility by  among other things  reducing our debt and overall costs of capital  including our interest and financing costs  and maximizing our return on capital employed  and evaluating opportunities for internal growth and growth by acquisition 
critical accounting policies a critical step in the preparation of our financial statements is the selection and application of accounting principles  policies  and procedures that affect the amounts that are reported 
in order to apply these principles  policies  and procedures  we must make judgments  assumptions  and estimates based on the best available information at the time 
actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events  some of which we may have little or no control over 
in addition  the methods used in applying the above may result in amounts that differ considerably from those that would result from the application of other acceptable methods 
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure below  have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our significant accounting policies  including revenue recognition  inventory valuation  and maintenance costs  are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item the following accounting policies are considered critical due to the uncertainties  judgments  assumptions and estimates involved accounting for contingencies  including environmental remediation and litigation liabilities see note  assessing the possible impairment of long lived assets see notes and accounting for asset retirement obligations see note  accounting for our pension and post retirement benefit plans see note  and accounting for inventories see note 
contingencies  including environmental remediation and litigation liabilities we have recorded various environmental remediation liabilities described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements in item for the most part  these liabilities result from past operations  including liabilities arising out of changes in environmental laws  and liabilities assumed in connection with acquired assets 
we are remediating these matters 
we record liabilities if environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
we do not discount environmental liabilities to their present value 
in general  we record environmental liabilities without consideration of potential recoveries from third parties  although we do take into account amounts that others are contractually obligated to pay us 
we employ independent consultants or our internal environmental personnel to investigate and assemble pertinent facts  recommend an appropriate remediation plan in light of regulatory standards  assist in estimating remediation costs based on existing technologies  and complete remediation according to approved plans 
if we do not use consultants  we estimate remediation costs based on the knowledge and experience of our employees having responsibility for the remediation project 
because of the uncertainty involved in our various remediation efforts and the period of time our efforts may take to complete  estimates are based on current regulatory standards 
we update our estimates as needed to reflect changes in the facts known to us  available technology  or applicable laws 
we often make subsequent adjustments to estimates  which may be significant  as more information becomes available to us  as the requirements of government agencies are changed or clarified  or as other circumstances change 

table of contents we record liabilities for litigation matters when it is probable that the outcome of litigation will be adverse and the costs and damages can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate these costs and damages based on the facts and circumstances of each case  our knowledge and experience  and the knowledge and experience of others with whom we may consult 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
for assets held for sale  we report long lived assets at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
for assets held and used  we use an undiscounted cash flow methodology to assess their recoverability 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows for these assets is less than their carrying value  we record impairment losses 
goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives are also subject to an annual impairment test 
changes in current economic conditions  assumptions regarding the timing and amounts of cash flows  or fair market value estimates could result in additional write downs of these assets in the future 
for a discussion of our impairment of long lived assets  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item asset retirement obligations we have legal obligations associated with the retirement of some of our long lived assets 
these obligations are related to some of our solid waste management facilities  some of our crude pipeline right of way agreements  and some of our underground and above ground storage tanks 
we use a discounted cash flow model to calculate the fair value of the asset retirement obligations 
key assumptions we use in estimating the fair value of these obligations are settlement date occurs at the end of the economic useful life  and settlement prices are estimated using consultant proposals and third party contractor invoices for substantially equivalent work and a market risk premium to cover uncertainties and unforeseeable circumstances 
changes in current economic conditions  assumptions regarding the timing and amounts of cash flows  or fair market value estimates could result in a change in the obligation in the future 
for a discussion of our asset retirement obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item pension and post retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of our pension and post retirement plans are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist of equity and debt securities  are valued using market prices 
plan obligations and the annual pension and post retirement medical expense are determined by independent actuaries and are based on a number of assumptions 
the key assumptions used in measuring the plan obligations include discount rate  long term rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rates 

table of contents changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions for our cash balance plan would have had on the projected benefit obligation  our reported pension liability on our consolidated balance sheet  and our reported pension expense on our consolidated statement of operations increase decrease impact on projected impact on impact on actuarial assumption a benefit obligation pension liability pension expense discount rate increase decrease expected long term rate of return on plan assets increase decrease a each fluctuation assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions for our retiree medical plan would have had on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation on our consolidated balance sheet and our reported postretirement benefit expense on our consolidated statement of operation increase decrease impact on impact on accumulated other postretirement postretirement actuarial assumption a benefit obligation benefit expense discount rate increase decrease health care cost trend rate b increase decrease a each fluctuation assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant 
b this assumes a change in the initial and ultimate health care cost trend rate 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
costs for crude oil and refined products produced by the refineries  and lubricants and other merchandise of phoenix fuel  are determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
under this method  the most recent acquisition costs are charged to cost of sales  and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs 
the company selected this method because it believed it more accurately reflects the cost of the company s current sales 
the use of this method results in reported earnings that can differ significantly from those that might be reported under a different inventory method such as the first in  first out fifo method 
under the fifo method  the earliest acquisition costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the latest acquisition costs 
in addition  the use of the lifo inventory method may result in increases or decreases to cost of sales in years that inventory volumes decline as the result of charging cost of sales with lifo inventory costs generated in prior periods 
in periods of rapidly declining prices  lifo inventories may have to be written down to market value due to the higher costs assigned to lifo volumes in prior periods 
market value is determined based on estimated selling 
table of contents prices less applicable refining  transportation and other selling costs  generally for the month subsequent to the end of the reporting period 
this topic is further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item results of operations the company s recent financial information is summarized in selected financial data in item the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in item  primarily note business segments

table of contents the processing of lower priced acidic crude oils at our yorktown refinery  including crude oil purchased under our supply agreement with statoil that began deliveries in late february  a processing unit turnaround at our yorktown refinery in  which resulted in the refinery being out of operation from march  to april   an unplanned shutdown of all processing units at the yorktown refinery from the end of april to the middle of may as a result of a breaker failure at the electric generation plant  which is owned by an unrelated power provider  that supplies the refinery  continued reduced production at our four corners refineries because of lower crude oil receipts due to reduced supply availability  stronger finished product sales volumes and margins for our phoenix fuel operations in  due to  among other things increased finished product demand  an expanded customer base  and tight finished product supplies in our phoenix market 
the shutdown of the alkylation unit at our ciniza refinery as a result of the fire that occurred on april   which resulted in the alkylation unit being out of operation from april  to september   a scheduled turnaround  which started early as a result of the fire discussed above  at the ciniza refinery  which resulted in the refinery being out of operation from april  to may  except the alkylation unit  which was not repaired and restarted until september   and lower throughput volumes at the yorktown refinery due to the delayed completion of refinery upgrades to process additional higher acid crude oil and unrelated operating problems with two units that were resolved by early january  comparison of the years ended december  and december  earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased  for the year ended december  this increase was  among other things  primarily due to the following an increase in operating earnings before corporate allocations from our refinery operations of  primarily due to higher margins  a increase in fuel volumes sold by phoenix fuel and slightly higher margins  a decrease in interest expense due to our refinancing transactions in  and  a  gain from an insurance settlement due to a fire incident 
this increase was partially offset by the following a increase in operating expenses  a decline in fuel volumes sold from our four corners refineries   of costs incurred and write offs of  of previously deferred financing costs and original issue discount that were related to early extinguishment of part of our long term debt as a result of the refinancing transactions in  and a decline in our retail group s merchandise margin due to  among other things  an inventory reduction and lower rebates 

table of contents yorktown refinery our yorktown refinery operated at an average throughput rate of approximately  barrels per day in  compared to  barrels per day in this increase was primarily due to the shutdowns that occurred in  which reduced our throughput rates in revenues for our yorktown refinery increased in primarily due to increases in volume and price per barrel sold 
cost of products sold for our yorktown refinery increased in primarily due to an increase in the average cost per barrel of crude oil and an increase in finished product volumes sold 
refining margins for were per barrel as compared to per barrel for the same period in this increase was primarily due to increased demand  lower imports into the east coast of finished products  lower nationwide production due to turnarounds being done  and limited refining capacity in the united states 
operating expenses increased in primarily due to the following higher maintenance costs primarily related to tank inspections and repairs and coker unit repairs  higher operating costs due to higher volumes  higher electrical costs and higher purchased costs of natural gas  higher chemical and catalyst costs  primarily related to higher cost catalyst required to meet more stringent sulfur reduction requirements  and higher payroll and related costs  due in part to the capitalization of certain wages in the first half of primarily due to turnaround activity and increased group medical insurance premiums and worker s compensation costs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in primarily due to the amortization of certain refinery turnaround costs incurred in as discussed more fully under the heading statoil agreement in items and of part i  in february  we entered into a long term crude oil supply agreement with statoil 
we believe our ability to process this higher acid crude oil will reduce our crude oil costs  improve our high value product output  and contribute significantly to higher earnings 
we believe this agreement will improve our competitiveness and reduce the impact of pricing volatility 
four corners refineries our four corners refineries operated at an average throughput rate of approximately  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in the decrease was primarily due to the reduced availability of crude oil 
revenues increased in primarily due to significantly higher prices  partially offset by lower volume 
sales volumes were reduced in because of lower crude oil supplies  the ciniza fire that occurred on april   and a turnaround at ciniza 
cost of products sold increased in primarily due to an increase in average crude oil prices  partially offset by a decrease in finished product volumes sold 
refining margins in were per barrel as compared to per barrel for the same period in the increase in was primarily due to increased demand  lower imports into the west coast of finished products  lower nationwide production due to turnarounds being done  and limited refining capacity in the united states 
operating expenses increased in primarily due to increased maintenance required for the bloomfield refinery 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense for our four corners refineries increased slightly in primarily due to additional depreciable assets that were placed in service 
retail group revenues for our retail group increased in primarily due to an increase in finished product selling prices 
similarly  cost of products sold for our retail group increased in primarily due to an increase in finished product purchase prices 
average fuel margin was per gallon in as compared to per gallon for the same period in primarily due to market conditions and higher cost of finished products 
fuel volumes sold in increased by as compared to the same period a year ago due to market conditions 
average merchandise margin was in as compared to in this decrease was due to an inventory reduction and lower rebates from suppliers during as compared to operating expenses for our retail group decreased in primarily due to a reduction in payroll and related costs 
depreciation expense for our retail group decreased in primarily due to some retail assets becoming fully depreciated 
phoenix fuel gasoline and diesel fuel volumes sold by phoenix fuel increased by in average gasoline and diesel fuel margins for phoenix fuel were per gallon for and were per gallon for revenues for phoenix fuel increased in primarily due to a increase in finished product selling prices and a increase in finished product volumes sold 
finished product sales volumes increased primarily due to marketing efforts to attract new customers and increased sales to existing customers because of increased demand and expanded customer operations 
cost of products sold for phoenix fuel increased in primarily due to a increase in finished product purchase prices and a increase in finished product volumes sold 
our phoenix fuel finished product margins increased slightly in operating expenses for phoenix fuel increased in primarily as a result of higher payroll and related costs due to higher sales volumes  and higher transportation costs due to expanded fleet expenses  which were also related to higher sales volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a from continuing operations for the year ended december   sg a expenses increased approximately  or to  from  in the comparable period 
the increase was primarily due to higher management incentive bonuses associated with improved company financial performance  higher litigation reserves  and increased costs associated with complying with the sarbanes oxley act 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in costs related to our self insured health plan due to improved claims experience 
interest expense from continuing operations for the year ended december   interest expense decreased approximately  or to  from  in the comparable period as a result of our refinancing transactions in see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for a further description of these transactions 

table of contents net gain loss on the disposal write down of assets from continuing operations for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of  on the disposal of assets 
this included losses totaling  on the sale of our vacant land and losses totaling  incurred as a result of sales and write downs of other assets in the ordinary course of business 
for the year ended december   we recorded net losses on the disposal write down of assets of  this amount includes the write off of  of capitalized costs relating to a capital project associated with our four corners refinery operations  which management determined was no longer viable after completing an ongoing evaluation  impairment write downs totaling  related to various retail assets and vacant land  and net losses totaling  related to other asset sales and write offs 
income taxes from continuing operations the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately 
discontinued operations discontinued operations include the operations of some of our retail service station convenience stores and our travel center  which was sold on june  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information relating to these operations 
outlook we believe that our current refining fundamentals are strong  although not as robust as the same time last year 
phoenix fuel continues to provide consistent cash flow and growth in the markets that it serves  with increased gross margins as compared to the same time last year 
our retail operations are continuing to experience growth in both merchandise and fuel sales on a comparable store basis 
recently  fuel margins within our retail operations have contracted primarily due to increases in the cost of fuel  however  merchandise margins have rebounded from their lower level 
our businesses are  however  very volatile and there can be no assurance that currently existing conditions will continue for any of our business segments 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased  for the year ended december  this increase was  among other things  primarily due to the following an increase in operating earnings before corporate allocations from our yorktown refinery of  a increase in our four corners refineries refining margin per barrel  a increase in our retail group fuel margin per gallon  and a increase in our retail group merchandise margin percentage 
this increase was partially offset by the following a increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses  a increase in operating expenses for our operations other than yorktown  a decline in our four corners refineries fuel volumes sold  a increase in interest expense  and net losses on the disposal write down of assets in compared to a net gain in 
table of contents yorktown refinery we owned our yorktown refinery for all of  but only for seven and one half months in the refinery operated at an average throughput rate of approximately  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in refining margins for were per barrel and for revenues for our yorktown refinery increased in due to a increase in finished product volumes sold and a increase in finished product selling prices 
most of the volume increase was due to the number of months of ownership 
sales volumes were reduced in and because in  we experienced three significant unscheduled shutdowns which impacted the amount of high value products we were able to produce  and in  we had a processing unit turnaround which resulted in our refinery being out of operation for approximately days and we also had a breaker failure that disrupted operations at the electric generation plant that caused us to shutdown all our processing units 
additionally in  hurricane isabel required us to shutdown the refinery for a period of time 
cost of products sold for our yorktown refinery increased in primarily due to the increase in finished product volumes sold and a increase in average crude oil costs 
in  our yorktown refining margins improved due to a combination of factors  including cold weather in the northeast in the early part of the year  resulting in an increased demand for heating oil  an extended summer driving season  resulting in part from warmer than normal east coast temperatures  and reduced foreign gasoline imports  due in part to the phase in of stricter gasoline specifications 
operating  sg a and depreciation expenses for our yorktown refinery also increased in four corners refineries our four corners refineries operated at an average throughput rate of approximately  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in refining margins for were per barrel and for revenues for our four corners refineries increased in primarily due to a increase in finished product selling prices  offset in part by a decrease in finished product volumes sold 
sales volumes were reduced because of lower crude oil supplies due to supplier production problems and reduced supply availability 
sales volumes previously sold to our travel center  which was sold in  continue to be sold to the purchaser of the travel center under a long term supply agreement 
cost of products sold for our four corners refineries increased in primarily due to a increase in average crude oil costs  offset in part by a decrease in finished product volumes sold 
our four corners refining margins improved in due to a combination of factors  including refinery supply problems on the west coast  refinery turnarounds by our competitors  and the kinder morgan pipeline rupture in august  which affected fuel supplies in the phoenix  arizona and southern arizona markets 
operating expenses for our four corners refineries increased in due to increased purchased fuel costs as a result of higher prices  and higher general insurance costs 
depreciation expense for our four corners refineries declined in due to lower refinery turnaround amortization costs in our ciniza refinery is scheduled for a major turnaround in the second quarter of 
table of contents retail group average gasoline and diesel margins for our retail group were per gallon for and were per gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel volumes sold for increased slightly 
average merchandise margins for our retail group were in and were in revenues for our retail group increased in primarily due to a increase in finished product selling prices 
cost of products sold for our retail group increased in primarily due to a increase in finished product purchase prices 
our retail fuel margins improved in due to a combination of factors  including the kinder morgan pipeline rupture  which affected the supply of finished products in the phoenix  arizona and southern arizona markets  more effectively managing our fuel pricing  and more favorable market conditions 
our retail merchandise margins improved in due to a combination of factors  including more favorable market conditions  implementation of marketing programs  and favorable supplier arrangements 
operating expenses for our retail group increased in due to higher payroll and related costs  higher credit card processing fees due to higher gasoline and diesel fuel selling prices  and increased environmental costs 
depreciation expense for our retail group declined in due to some retail assets becoming fully depreciated 
phoenix fuel gasoline and diesel fuel volumes sold by phoenix fuel increased by in average gasoline and diesel fuel margins for phoenix fuel were per gallon for and were per gallon for revenues for phoenix fuel increased in primarily due to a increase in finished product selling prices and a increase in finished product volumes sold 
finished product sales volumes increased due to marketing efforts to attract new customers and increased sales to existing customers because of increased demand 
cost of products sold for phoenix fuel increased in due to a increase in finished product purchase prices and a increase in finished product volumes sold 
our phoenix fuel finished product margins remained relatively stable in  declining approximately as a result of market conditions 
operating expenses for phoenix fuel increased in due to higher payroll and related costs due to higher sales volumes  and higher repair and maintenance costs due to expanded fleet expenses  also related to higher sales volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a from continuing operations for the year ended december   sg a expenses increased approximately  or to  from  in the comparable period 
the increase includes sg a increases relating to the yorktown refinery of  
table of contents sg a expense increases for our other operations were due to accruals for management incentive bonuses  increased costs for our self insured health plan  due to higher claims experience  higher workers compensation costs  increased letter of credit fees  and higher officers and directors insurance premiums 
the first quarter of included a credit of  in sg a expenses for the revision of estimated accruals for management incentive bonuses  following the determination of bonuses to be paid to employees 
interest expense from continuing operations for the year ended december   interest expense increased approximately  or to  from  in the comparable period 
interest expense increased approximately  due to the issuance of senior subordinated notes for the may acquisition of our yorktown refinery 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in interest expense of approximately  relating to our  of senior subordinated notes due that were repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the issuance of the senior subordinated notes in  and lower interest expense of approximately  relating to lower borrowings under our revolving credit facility in net gain loss on the disposal write down of assets from continuing operations for the year ended december   we recorded net losses on the disposal write down of assets of  this amount includes the write off of  of capitalized costs relating to a capital project associated with our four corners refinery operations  which management determined was no longer viable after completing an ongoing evaluation  impairment write downs of  related to various retail assets and vacant land and net losses of  related to other asset sales and write offs

discontinued operations discontinued operations include the operations of some of our retail service station convenience stores and our travel center  which was sold on june  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information relating to these operations 
liquidity and capital resources capital structure at december  we had long term debt of  at december  our long term debt was  net of the current portion of  the amount at december  includes  before discount  of senior subordinated notes due  and  before discount  of senior subordinated notes due 
table of contents the amount at december  includes  of senior subordinated notes due  and  of senior subordinated notes due as is discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  we completed the refinancing of a portion of our long term debt in the second quarter of as part of the refinancing  we completed the following a tender offer and consent solicitation for our senior subordinated notes due  a redemption of the notes not tendered in the tender offer  the sale of  of senior subordinated notes due  the sale of  shares of our common stock  the prepayment of the outstanding balance on our mortgage loan facility  and the renegotiation of our revolving credit facility 
in connection with these transactions  we incurred and expensed  of costs associated with early debt extinguishment  and we wrote off  of previously deferred financing costs and original issue discount 
we also incurred additional costs that have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the notes 
at december   our long term debt was of total capital 
at december   it was 
our net debt long term debt  net of current portion less cash and cash equivalents to total capitalization long term debt  net of current portion less cash and cash equivalents plus total stockholders equity percentage at december   was 
at december   this percentage was 
the decrease in each percentage is primarily related to the reduction in long term debt during and the issuance of additional shares of our stock as discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item at december   we also had a  revolving credit facility that we entered into on july  the credit facility amended and restated a similar  credit facility 
this amendment  among other things  extends the maturity of the facility for an additional three years 
this amendment substantially reduces our existing borrowing and letter of credit costs and relaxes some of the covenants in the credit facility 
due to this amendment  we also incurred financing costs in connection with our credit facility that have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the facility 
we also expanded the size of our bank group to accommodate a much larger credit facility should it become useful 
for a further discussion of this matter  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item the credit facility is primarily a working capital and letter of credit facility 
at december   we had no direct borrowings outstanding under the facility and  of letters of credit outstanding 
at december   we had no direct borrowings outstanding under the previous facility and  of letters of credit outstanding 
on july   we prepaid our mortgage loan facility in full from cash on hand 
this facility had a balance of  on december  as described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  the indentures governing our notes and our credit facility contain restrictive covenants and other terms and conditions that if not maintained  if violated  or if certain conditions are met  could result in default  affect our ability to borrow funds  make certain payments  or engage in certain activities 
a default under any of the notes or the credit facility could cause such debt  and by reason of cross default provisions  our other debt to become immediately due and payable 
if we are unable to repay such amounts  the lenders under our credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt 
if our lenders accelerate the 
table of contents payment of the credit facility  we cannot provide assurance that our assets would be sufficient to pay that debt and other debt or that we would be able to refinance such debt or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our ability to comply with the covenants  and other terms and conditions  of the indentures and the credit facility may be affected by many events beyond our control 
for example  higher than anticipated capital expenditures or a prolonged period of low refining margins could have a negative impact on our ability to borrow funds and to make expenditures and could have an adverse impact on compliance with our covenants 
we cannot provide assurance that our operating results will be sufficient to allow us to comply with the covenants 
as discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  we will be making substantial capital expenditures for government mandated environmental projects in and in future years 
as a result of opportunities to purchase capital equipment required for some of these projects at more favorable costs  certain expenditures planned for future years have been accelerated into due to these accelerated capital expenditures  but depending on the results of our operations  we may not meet the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in our credit facility in the second  third and fourth quarters of although we do not anticipate any issues in obtaining any requested waivers or amendments to our credit facility if needed  we cannot assure you that the waivers or amendments will be obtained 
the failure to meet the covenant or to obtain a requested waiver or amendment to the facility could have a material adverse effect on us 
our high degree of leverage and these covenants may  among other things limit our ability to use cash flow  or obtain additional financing  for future working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  restrict our ability to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock  require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments  limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in business and industry conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and  to the extent of our outstanding debt under our floating rate debt facilities  the impact of increases in interest rates 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  borrow sufficient funds to service our debt  or meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  then  due to borrowing base restrictions  increased letter of credit requirements  or otherwise  we may be required to sell additional assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  or obtain additional financing 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to do any of these things on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we presently have senior subordinated ratings of b from moody s investor services and b from standard poor s 
moody s investor services recently confirmed its b rating 
standard and poor s also reaffirmed its ratings but revised the outlook to positive from negative 

table of contents cash flow from operations our cash flow from operations depends primarily on producing and selling quantities of refined products at margins sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses 
in recent years  crude oil costs and prices of refined products have fluctuated substantially 
these costs and prices depend on numerous factors  including the supply of and demand for crude oil  gasoline and other refined products  changes in the us economy  changes in the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products  worldwide political conditions  the extent of government laws  and local factors  including market conditions  pipeline capacity  and the level of operations of other refineries in our markets 
our crude oil requirements are supplied from sources that include major oil companies  large independent producers  and smaller local producers 
except for our long term supply agreement with statoil  our crude oil supply contracts are generally relatively short term contracts 
these contracts generally contain market responsive pricing provisions 
an increase in crude oil prices could adversely affect our operating margins if we are unable to pass along the increased cost of raw materials to our customers 
our sale prices for refined products are influenced by the commodity price of crude oil 
generally  an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil results in a corresponding increase or decrease in the price of gasoline and other refined products 
the timing of the relative movement of the prices  however  as well as the overall change in product prices  could reduce profit margins and could have a significant impact on our refining and marketing operations  earnings  and cash flows 
in addition  we maintain inventories of crude oil  intermediate products  and refined products  the values of which are subject to rapid fluctuation in market prices 
price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the manufactured refined products could have a significant effect on our operating results 
any long term adverse relationships between costs and prices could impact our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows to meet our working capital needs 
moreover  the industry is highly competitive 
many of our competitors are large  integrated oil companies which  because of their more diverse operations  larger refineries  stronger capitalization and better brand name recognition  may be better able than we are to withstand volatile industry conditions  including shortages or excesses of crude oil or refined products or intense price competition at the wholesale and retail levels 
because some of our competitors refineries are larger and more efficient than our refineries  these refineries may have lower per barrel crude oil refinery processing costs 
our ability to borrow funds under our current revolving credit facility could be adversely impacted by low product prices that could reduce the borrowing base related to eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
in addition  the structuring of the statoil supply agreement will result in a lower availability of funds under the borrowing base calculation of our credit facility  however  because of the terms of the statoil agreement  our borrowing needs will be reduced 
our debt instruments also contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to borrow funds if certain thresholds are not maintained 
see the discussion above in capital structure for further information relating to these loan covenants 
we anticipate that working capital  including that necessary for capital expenditures and debt service  will be funded through existing cash balances  cash generated from operating activities  existing credit facilities  and  if necessary  future financing arrangements 
future liquidity  both short and long term  will continue to be primarily dependent on producing or purchasing  and selling  sufficient quantities of refined products at margins sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses 
based on the current operating environment for all of our operations and our anticipated borrowing capacity  we believe that we will have sufficient working capital to meet our needs over the next month period 

table of contents working capital working capital at december  consisted of current assets of  and current liabilities of  or a current ratio of at december   the current ratio was  with current assets of  and current liabilities of  capital expenditures and resources net cash used in investing activities for capital expenditures totaled approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  expenditures for were primarily for rebuilding the alkylation unit that was damaged by the fire at our ciniza refinery on april   upgrades at our yorktown refinery required to process additional volumes of higher acid crude oil  a turnaround at our ciniza refinery  and the purchase of a hydrogen plant for our yorktown refinery 
expenditures for primarily were for turnaround expenditures at the yorktown refinery and operational and environmental projects for the refineries and retail operations 
we received proceeds of approximately  from the sale of property  plant and equipment and other assets in and  in proceeds received in primarily were from the sale of a property known as jomax  vacant land  and seven stores that were classified as assets held for sale 
we also received approximately  of insurance proceeds due to the fire incident at ciniza 
proceeds received in primarily were from the sale of our corporate headquarters building and approximately eight acres of surrounding land  the sale of our travel center  and the sale of nine service station convenience stores 
we continue to monitor and evaluate our assets and may sell additional non strategic or underperforming assets that we identify as circumstances allow 
we also continue to evaluate potential acquisitions in our strategic markets  including lease arrangements 
on may   we acquired the yorktown refinery from bp corporation north america inc and bp products north america inc 
for  plus  for inventories  the assumption of certain liabilities  and a conditional earn out  the maximum amount of which could not exceed  we also incurred transaction costs of approximately  in connection with the acquisition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for a more detailed discussion of this transaction 
we financed our yorktown refinery acquisition and the refinancing of  of senior subordinated notes due with the proceeds from the sale of  of senior subordinated notes due  borrowings on our previous revolving credit facility and mortgage loan facility  and cash on hand 
we also paid approximately  of financing fees to various financial institutions in connection with these financing arrangements 
as part of the yorktown acquisition  from to  we agreed to pay to the sellers earn out payments based on certain market value factors up to a maximum of  this requirement was satisfied in the third quarter of for the year ended december   we paid  in earn outs under the purchase agreement 
for a further discussion of these earn out payments see note to our consolidated financial statements in item 
table of contents following the acquisition of our yorktown refinery  we developed a debt reduction strategy with the goal of reducing indebtedness by  prior to year end the goal was to be accomplished by managing inventory to a lower level  reducing non essential capital expenditures  and selling non core and or underperforming assets 
although we did not reach our goal in  the strategy was carried forward 
the result of the debt reduction strategy follows reduction reduction reduction total reduction revolving credit facility term loan senior subordinated notes capital lease obligations total these reductions were paid from operating cash flows  proceeds from the sale of assets and proceeds from the sale of common stock described above 
in prior years  we initiated two capital projects relating to our four corners refinery operations  and capitalized approximately  of costs associated with these projects 
in the third quarter of  we completed an ongoing evaluation of these projects and wrote off  of capitalized costs relating to one capital project after determining that it was no longer viable 
we currently anticipate that the other capital project in the approximate amount of  will be completed in the first quarter of to enhance operations at the ciniza refinery 
we have budgeted to spend up to approximately  for capital expenditures in excluding any potential acquisitions 
of this amount  approximately  is for the completion of projects that were started in approximately  is budgeted for capital projects to meet certain clean fuel regulations and  to comply with the environmental consent decree at our yorktown refinery 
in addition  approximately  is budgeted for non discretionary projects that are required by law or regulation or to maintain the physical integrity of existing assets 
another  is budgeted for discretionary projects to sustain or enhance the current level of operations  increase earnings associated with existing or new business and to expand existing operations 
this amount includes  for our retail operations to be used to remodel two units and for operational and service upgrades for other units 
our budget also includes  for capital expenditure contingencies 
if cash flow generated from operations is insufficient to fund these planned capital expenditures for  we may need to draw on our line of credit  secure additional financing  access the public debt or equity markets  or sell assets 
we cannot assure you that these sources will be available 
in future years  we will be making substantial capital expenditures for government mandated environmental projects  including the low sulfur fuel requirements previously discussed 
see discussions under the caption regulatory  environmental and other matters included in items and for more details of these projects  below under the caption clean fuels and consent decree expenditures  and in note to our consolidated financial statements in item we continue to investigate other capital improvements to our existing facilities 
the amount of capital projects that are actually undertaken in will depend on  among other things  general business conditions and results of operations 
much of the capital currently budgeted for environmental compliance is integrally related to operations or to operationally required projects 
we do not specifically identify capital expenditures related to such projects on the basis of whether they are for environmental as opposed to economic purposes 
with respect to capital expenditures budgeted primarily to satisfy environmental regulations  we estimate that the following amounts were spent 
table of contents  and we anticipate that approximately  will be spent in primarily to satisfy environmental regulations 
with respect to our operating expenses for environmental compliance  while records are not kept specifically identifying or allocating such expenditures  we believe that we incur significant operating expense for such purposes 
changes in the tax laws and changes in federal and state environmental laws also may increase future capital and operating expenditure levels 
long term commitments included in the table below is a list of our obligations to make future payments under contracts and other agreements  as well as certain other contingent commitments 
payments due all remaining total years in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase obligations raw material purchases finished product purchases services total other long term obligations aggregate environmental reserves pension obligations aggregate litigation reserves interest obligations total total obligations excluding original issue discount 
the amounts set out in the table  including payment dates  are our best estimates at this time  but may vary as circumstances change or we become aware of additional facts 
raw material and finished product purchases were determined by multiplying contract volumes by the price determined under the contract as of december  the contracts underlying these calculations all have variable pricing arrangements 
the above table does not include amounts for outstanding purchase orders at december   amounts under contracts that are cancelable by either party upon giving notice  and amounts under agreements that are based on a percentage of sales  such as credit card processing fees 
we cannot estimate our future pension expenditures beyond we are obligated to make a lump sum payment to the pension retirement plan each year 
not included in the table are certain retiree medical and asset retirement obligations for which annual funding is not required 
our asset retirement obligations are discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements in item and our pension plan and retiree medical plan obligations are described in more detail in note 
table of contents the indentures governing our notes and our credit facility contain restrictive covenants and other terms and conditions that if not maintained  if violated  or if certain conditions are met  could result in default  early redemption of the notes  affect our ability to borrow funds  make certain payments  or engage in certain activities 
a default under any of the notes or the credit facility could cause such debt  and by reason of cross default provisions  our other debt to become immediately due and payable 
included in the table below is a list of our commitments under our revolving credit facility 
amount of commitment expiration all remaining other commercial commitments total years in thousands line of credit including standby letters of credit standby letters of credit standby letters of credit reduce the availability of funds for direct borrowings under the line of credit 
at december  there were no direct borrowings under the line of credit 
the availability of letters of credit under our credit facility is  our inability to post satisfactory letters of credit could constrain our ability to purchase feedstocks on the most beneficial terms 
clean fuels and consent decree expenditures see discussions under the caption regulatory  environmental and other matters included in items and and note to our consolidated financial statements in item for more details of these projects 
the following table shows amounts we anticipate spending to meet  among other things  certain clean fuel regulations and to comply with an environmental consent decree that requires certain actions to be taken at our yorktown refinery 
the table does not include amounts for which environmental accruals have been established  which are instead included in the long term commitments table above 
these amounts are our best estimates at this time  but may vary as circumstances change or we become aware of additional facts 
projected capital expenditures amount yorktown clean fuels four corners clean fuels yorktown sewer system yorktown consent decree total anticipated cash obligations the amounts shown in the above table are the high end of our estimated costs for these projects 
we anticipate that the costs could be between the following ranges yorktown clean fuels  to  four corners clean fuels  to  yorktown sewer system  to  and consent decree  to  cash requirements we believe we will have sufficient resources to meet our working capital requirements  including that necessary for capital expenditures and debt service  over the next month period because of the current operating environment for all of our operations  
table of contents current cash balances  and availability of funds under our revolving credit facility 
in order to create additional flexibility and to assist us in meeting future anticipated expenditures  we are in the process of evaluating a number of strategies to further reduce debt and interest expense 
until these strategies are implemented  we will use operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to meet our commitments 
our ability to meet these commitments could be impacted by our compliance with the covenants in our debt instruments 
for a discussion of the potential impact of the covenants on our operations  see the discussion under the heading liquidity and capital resources capital structure in item of part ii 
dividends we currently do not pay dividends on our common stock 
the board of directors will periodically review our policy regarding the payment of dividends 
any future dividends are subject to the results of our operations  declaration by the board of directors  and existing debt covenants 
risk management we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in certain commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these normal business exposures  we may  from time to time  use commodity futures and options contracts to reduce price volatility  to fix margins in our refining and marketing operations  and to protect against price declines associated with our crude oil and finished products inventories 
our policies for the use of derivative financial instruments set limits on quantities  require various levels of approval and require review and reporting procedures 
in and  we entered into various crude oil and gasoline futures contracts to economically hedge crude oil and other inventories and purchases for our yorktown refinery operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized losses on these contracts of approximately  in cost of products sold 
for the year ended december   we recognized losses on similar contracts of approximately  these transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and accordingly were marked to market each month 
there were no open crude oil futures contracts or other commodity derivative contracts at december  and december  our credit facility is floating rate debt tied to various short term indices 
as a result  our annual interest costs associated with this debt may fluctuate 
at december   there were no direct borrowings outstanding under this facility 
our loan facility was floating rate debt tied to various short term indices 
as a result  our annual interest costs associated with this debt fluctuated 
at december   there was  outstanding under this facility  which we paid off in july our operations are subject to the normal hazards  including fire  explosion and weather related perils 
we maintain various insurance coverages  including business interruption insurance  subject to certain deductibles 
we are not fully insured against some risks because some risks are not fully insurable  coverage is unavailable  or premium costs  in our judgment  do not justify such expenditures 
credit risk with respect to customer receivables is concentrated in the geographic areas in which we operate and relates primarily to customers in the oil and gas industry 
to minimize this risk  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial position and require collateral  such as letters of credit  in certain circumstances 
other federal  state and local laws relating to the environment  health and safety affect nearly all of our operations 
as is the case with other companies engaged in similar industries  we face significant exposure 
table of contents from actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental  health and safety matters 
these matters include soil and water contamination  air pollution and personal injuries or property damage allegedly caused by substances made  handled  used  released or disposed of by us or by our predecessors 
various laws govern the investigation and remediation of contamination at our current and former properties  as well as at third party sites to which we sent wastes for disposal 
we may be held liable for contamination existing at our current or former properties even though a prior operator of the site  or other third party  caused the contamination 
we also may be held responsible for costs associated with contamination cleanup at third party disposal sites even if the original disposal activities met all applicable regulatory requirements at the time 
we are now engaged in a number of these remediation projects 
our future expenditures for compliance with environmental  health and safety matters cannot be estimated in many circumstances for various reasons 
these reasons include the speculative nature of remediation and cleanup cost estimates and methods  imprecise and conflicting data regarding the hazardous nature of various substances  the number of other potentially responsible parties involved  defenses that may be available to us  and changing environmental  health and safety laws  including changing interpretations of these laws 
we cannot give assurance that compliance with laws  investigations  enforcement proceedings  private party claims  or cleanup requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
for a further discussion of environmental  health and safety matters affecting our operations  see the discussion of these matters contained in items and under the heading regulatory  environmental and other matters 
rules and regulations implementing federal  state and local laws relating to the environment  health and safety will continue to affect our operations 
we cannot predict what new environmental  health or safety legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or enforced with respect to our products or activities 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies  could have an adverse effect on our financial position and operating results and could require substantial expenditures by us for  among other things the installation and operation of refinery equipment  pollution control systems and other equipment not currently possessed by us  the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to our activities  and the initiation or modification of cleanup activities 

table of contents as of december  and  we had environmental liability accruals of approximately  and  respectively  and litigation accruals of approximately  and  respectively 
the environmental liability accruals summarized in the table below are recorded in the current and long term sections of our consolidated balance sheets

in february  we filed a complaint against the united states in the united states court of federal claims in connection with military jet fuel that we sold to the defense energy support center from through we asserted that the federal government underpaid us for jet fuel by approximately  for a discussion of this matter  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item  captioned commitments and contingencies 
our ciniza and bloomfield refineries primarily process a mixture of high gravity  low sulfur crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids 
the locally produced  high quality crude oil known as four corners sweet is the primary feedstock for these refineries 
our current projections of four corners crude oil production indicate that our crude oil demand will exceed the crude oil supply that is available from local sources for the foreseeable future 
we expect to operate the ciniza and bloomfield refineries at lower levels than otherwise would be scheduled as a result of shortfalls in four corners crude oil production 
for a further discussion of raw material supply for our refineries  see the discussion contained in items and under the heading raw material supply 
we are aware of a completed project and a number of plans regarding product pipeline projects that could impact portions of our marketing areas 
these projects could result in increased competition by increasing the amount of refined products potentially available in our markets  as well as improving competitor access to these areas 
it also could result in new opportunities for us  as we are a net purchaser of refined products in some of these areas 
for a further discussion of the potential impact of pipeline projects on our operations  as well as other competitive factors affecting these operations  see the discussion of competitive factors contained in items and under the heading competitive conditions 

table of contents our refining activities are conducted at our two refinery locations in new mexico and the yorktown refinery in virginia 
these refineries constitute a significant portion of our operating assets  and the two new mexico refineries supply a significant portion of our retail operations 
as a result  our operations would be significantly interrupted if any of the refineries were to experience a major accident  be damaged by severe weather or other natural disaster  or otherwise be forced to shut down 
if any of the refineries were to experience an interruption in supply or operations  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
in october  the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act  which includes energy related tax provisions 
under the act  small refiners are allowed to deduct for tax purposes up to of capital expenditures spent to comply with highway diesel low sulfur regulations adopted by the environmental protection agency in the year the capital expenditure is made 
small refiners also are allowed to take an environmental tax credit of five cents on each gallon of low sulfur diesel fuel they produce  up to a maximum of of the capital costs incurred to comply with the regulations 
these regulations and our estimated capital expenditure compliance costs are discussed under the caption regulatory  environmental and other matters in items and of part i 
since we satisfy the act s definition of small refiner  we should be able to take advantage of the favorable tax provisions contained in the act beginning in at this time  however  we cannot estimate the effect  if any  these tax provisions may have on our future earnings 
we have a cash balance retirement plan and a retiree medical plan for the employees of our yorktown refinery 
these plans contain many of the same features of plans that were in place for the employees of the former owners 
all yorktown employees meeting the eligibility requirements are automatically included in the cash balance plan 
we must make a lump sum payment to the cash balance plan each year 
the medical plan is a post retirement benefit plan 
the medical plan will pay a percentage of the medical premium for coverage under the plan 
coverage is available to full time yorktown employees who are age or older with or more years of service  provided they meet the plan s eligibility requirements 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a more detailed discussion of these plans
