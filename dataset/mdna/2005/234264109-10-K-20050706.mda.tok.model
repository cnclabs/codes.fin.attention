item business general development of business company background and overview 
daktronics  inc was founded by dr 
aelred kurtenbach and dr 
duane sander in while they were professors of electrical engineering at south dakota state university sdsu in brookings  south dakota 
our long and close relationship with sdsu and other south dakota colleges and universities is a key factor contributing to our leadership in the industry 
we have been able to experience sustained growth due in part to the capability of the local universities and colleges to provide an important source of highly educated full time and student employees 
in  we manufactured and sold our first product a voting display system for the utah state legislature 
soon thereafter  we expanded into manufacturing electronic scoreboards and commercial displays using the technology and experience we developed 
these scoreboard and commercial displays integrated computers as display controllers to process information and to formulate that information for presentation on a display 
at that time  we also began building computer programmable information display systems utilizing standard modules in a variety of configurations 
the use of modular sections for both our smaller and larger display systems allowed us to offer a broad range of both standard and custom products 
innovations like these helped us obtain a major scoreboard contract for the olympic winter games in lake placid as well as installation contracts at several large universities 
over the years  we continued to enhance our controller and display technology by creating and acquiring new display technologies 
these developments led to our first scoreboard installation at a professional sports facility 
during the s  we focused on expanding our product line  increasing market share and developing new markets for products 
we were successful in increasing our market share in these areas and  as a result  grew commensurately 
our professional and manufacturing talent allows us to continue to design  enhance  create and manufacture and market cutting edge products 
new technology continues to provide opportunities for us to expand 
the development of blue and green light emitting devices leds in the mid nineties has led to significant changes in the electronic display market  principally the development of full color led displays 
prior to that time the majority of daktronics products were based on incandescent or reflective display technologies 
today  led technology has totally displaced the incandescent and reflective technologies for large format displays 
led technology excels over incandescent technology because of its superior viewing characteristics  energy efficiency  cost of maintenance and lifetime 
it excels over reflective technology in all the same areas except energy efficiency  as the reflective technology is extremely energy efficient 
more recently we began offering display networks incorporating lcd and plasma technology displays in what is commonly referred to as digital advertising or narrowcasting systems 
we also offer a range of proprietary display control software to complement the display technologies  and are able to offer customers complete integrated system solutions 
we also develop content for the displays  including animations and advertising content to assist our clients in realizing the maximum impact and benefit from their display systems 
over the past few years  we achieved significant recognition and awards for our products and financial performance 
in  our chairman  dr 
aelred kurtenbach  was awarded the national ernst young entrepreneur of the year award for the manufacturing category 
we have also been named  on numerous occasions  as the south dakota business of the year by the south dakota chamber of commerce and industry 
we were ranked th and nd on forbes list of the best small companies in america in and  and th and rd in and on the list of america s fastest growing small companies by fortune small business magazine 
we ranked th and th on the list of the best small companies in and by business week magazine and th  th and th on the list of the fastest growing tech companies by business in   and according to a recent industry report  we have the largest share of the worldwide market for led video displays and are considered the top led text display supplier in the world 
business developments 
with the advent of full color led display systems and various software applications  we gained significant market share through designing and manufacturing quality products and providing technical expertise and services 
our products are now seen in an array of major professional and university sports complexes  including  among others  fully integrated systems at the rodgers center in toronto toronto blue jays  soldier field in chicago chicago bears  xcel energy center in st 
paul minnesota wild  alltel stadium in jacksonville jacksonville jaguars  the new charlotte arena in charlotte charlotte bobcats  the palace at auburn hills detroit pistons and the university of wisconsin 
we increased our market share of international sports venues  including such sites as the berlin olympic stadium  and  in paris  france  roland garros home of the french open and the bercy arena 
on the world stage  our products performance and integrated solution led to their selection and use at the   and olympic games 
we aggressively built market share in areas beyond the large venue sports market 
we have also installed signature displays in the commercial market from the financial market sector as seen at the kuwait national stock exchange to the new coca cola display in times square  new york city 
in addition  we designed and manufactured billboards along highways across the country 
we designed and manufactured commercial installations  including multi million dollar displays in las vegas  nevada and branson  missouri and small message signs for national retailers and quick serve restaurants 
further  we also design and manufacture transportation display systems  such as over the road message displays for many state and federal agencies  including the departments of transportation in virginia  new jersey  new york  rhode island  connecticut  california  washington  delaware  illinois  pennsylvania  mexico  and canada 
one of our core growth strategies is to enter geographic markets by opening a small sales and service office that provides after sale support to our entire product line  sales of standard products and support on large custom projects 
this network of offices  which totals locations throughout the world  has historically been and we expect it to continue to be an extremely important growth strategy 
we occasionally acquire new businesses that provide access to new markets or complement our existing products 
in the past five years  we have acquired four companies 
in  we acquired servtrotech  inc  a company located in montreal  quebec  canada 
this acquisition has provided new products and improved distribution 
it further expanded our ability to provide after sales service and support to our canadian customers by improving our response time and expanding our expertise 
we also acquired keyframe  inc  which provides video animation content  logos  advertising and other services 
its acquisition allowed us to offer video content related services and support to complement our fully integrated display systems 
in fiscal year  we acquired two companies 
european timing systems  ltd 
in bristol  england assembles  sells and services timing and scoring solutions for an array of products  including aquatics timing systems  cricket display boards  and other electronic display systems 
we anticipate that this acquisition will assist us to further increase our market share in the united kingdom  provide access to new markets and increase our ability to provide after sales service 
we also acquired dodge electronics  inc  a manufacturer of sound systems in topeka  kansas 
we purchased equipment from dodge electronics  inc for a number of years and came to the conclusion that acquiring it would allow us to provide our customers with a more fully integrated display and sound systems 
although these purchases increased the scope of services or technology that we are able to provide  our primary growth objective is still the increase of sales through organic growth 
financial information about segments our global business is principally in a single industry segment the design  development  marketing and support of visual display solutions for the sports  commercial and transportation markets 
narrative description of business we are the world s leading supplier of electronic scoreboards  large electronic display systems  marketing services  digital messaging solutions and related software and services for sports  commercial and transportation applications 
our continuing focus is on supporting customers with superior products integration and services that provide dynamic  reliable and unique visual communication solutions 
we offer a complete line of products  from small indoor and outdoor scoreboards and electronic displays to large  multi million dollar  video display systems as well as related control systems  timing and sound systems and professional services 
we are recognized worldwide as a technical leader with the capabilities to design  market  manufacture  install and service complete integrated systems that display real time data  graphics  animation and video 
we are engaged in a full range of activities marketing and sales  engineering and design  manufacturing  and service and support 
each of those activities is described below 
marketing and sales 
our products have been sold throughout the united states and in many other countries through a combination of direct sales personnel and independent resellers 
in the united states and canada  we use primarily a direct sales force for professional sports  colleges and universities  convention centers and smaller sports facilities  including high schools and transportation applications 
in smaller commercial applications  we use a combination of direct sales staff and resellers 
the majority of the products sold by resellers are standard or catalog products 
these are typically moderately priced and relatively easy to install 
a limited number of models are built to inventory and available for quick delivery 
we support our resellers through national and regional direct mail advertising  trade journal advertising  trade show exhibitions and direct sales force support in the field 
we believe that we can expand market share by expanding both our direct sales force and resellers 
our direct sales force is comprised of a network of offices located throughout the world supporting all customer types in both sales and service 
in addition to supporting resellers as mentioned above  the direct sales staff also sells the entire range of our standard products and substantially all the large video display systems 
our direct sales staff is structured in a way to maximize cross selling opportunities across markets 
to accomplish this  we have developed a matrix structure where the main focus and reporting responsibilities fall into one of our three main markets 
a complementary emphasis is then placed on a regional structure to create opportunities in other markets and to support efforts for the organization as a whole 
when we target a potential customer for sales opportunities  the prospect is contacted either directly or through a reseller 
frequently on larger sales opportunities  engineers  technicians and sales personnel jointly participate in site visits to assess site conditions  evaluate the customer s requirements and assemble and present proposals 
proposals to prospective customers include business and technical presentations as well as product demonstrations and visits to existing installations 
we also regularly host prospective customers at our manufacturing facility to demonstrate product quality and delivery capability 
international sales fluctuate from year to year based on the timing of large system projects 
a typical term of sale for international projects includes a letter of credit or partial payment in advance 
we believe that in addition to the growth we expect domestically  we will also achieve growth in the international markets 
during fiscal years  and  approximately  and of our net sales  respectively  were derived from international sales 
since  we have acquired or opened five international office locations  including frankfurt  germany  bristol  england  montreal and toronto  canada  and macau 
we also are a owner in a joint venture in malaysia  serving the asean region 
much of our marketing and sales success in the past was based on our ability to create new products and product enhancements for customers by understanding their needs and opportunities 
we have developed and continue to develop this understanding through active participation in the sales cycle by engineers and various others and through attendance at trade shows  conventions and seminars as well as through a culture of teamwork throughout the organization 
engineering and product development 
the large screen electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in technology and complementary services 
to remain competitive  we must continue to anticipate and respond to changes and developments in the industry 
we will continue our tradition of applying engineering resources throughout our business to help achieve more effective product development by investing approximately of our net sales into product design and development 
we employ engineers and technicians in the areas of mechanical and electrical design  applications engineering  and customer and product support 
unlike some companies  which depend on contract engineering from outside vendors  we use in house engineering to anticipate and respond rapidly to the product development needs of customers and the marketplace 
we typically assign product managers from our engineering staff to each product or product family to assist our sales staff in training  to implement product improvements and to ensure that each product is designed for maximum reliability and serviceability 
our product development personnel also modify existing products and develop new products to comply with rule changes for particular sports 
we also invest in new creative technologies and in companies developing new technologies 
our engineering staff consists of the following four product development groups aligned with the primary product families sport products engineering  video products engineering  commercial products engineering and transportation products engineering 
each design group is autonomous to allow it to focus on one product family  while at the same time the engineering groups are closely tied with each other to facilitate sharing ideas and technology 
this organizational structure positions us for effective product development in the future because of our concentrated focus on standardization  which reduces the amount of engineering time allocated to one time custom design 
manufacturing and technical contracting 
as a vertically integrated manufacturer of display systems  we perform most sub assembly and substantially all final assembly of our products 
we also serve as a technical contractor for customers who desire custom hardware design  custom software development  installation or other technical services 
our manufacturing operations include component manufacturing printed circuit boards and system manufacturing metal fabrication  electronic assembly  sub assembly and final assembly 
star circuits  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  manufactures printed circuit boards primarily for our products at a separate production facility located in brookings  south dakota 
we augment our production capacity with the use of outside subcontractors primarily for metal fabrication and loading printed circuit boards 
we use a modular approach for manufacturing displays 
standard product modules are designed to be used in a variety of different products 
this modular approach reduces parts inventory and improves manufacturing efficiency 
we inventory a limited supply of standard products 
custom projects are built according to the customer s specifications 
product modules are designed so that a custom product may include a significant percentage of standard components to maximize reliability and ease of service 
in scheduling and manufacturing  production employees work as teams to ensure quality and timely delivery while minimizing excess inventories 
our order entry  production  customer service and many other functions are also consolidated through an erp enterprise resource planning system to facilitate communication among employee teams throughout the entire sales  design  production and delivery process 
technical contracting 
we serve as a technical contractor for larger display system installations that require custom designs and innovative product solutions 
the purchase of scoreboards and other state of the art display systems for large installations typically involves competitive proposals 
as a part of our response to a proposal request  we may suggest additional products or features to assist the prospective customer in analyzing the optimal type of display system 
if requested by a customer or if necessary to help secure a bid  we will include as a part of our proposal the work necessary to prepare the site and install the display system 
in such cases  we may serve as the general contractor and retain subcontractors 
we are licensed in a number of domestic jurisdictions as a contractor 
professional services 
our professional services are essential to continued market penetration 
to enhance the level of service available to our customers  we provide maintenance and support services in all of our offices throughout the world 
we plan to open other offices in the future to supplement our service capabilities 
sales of our standard and  to a lesser degree  custom products to small and mid sized sports venues and commercial customers are also made through these offices 
in addition  we use a network of authorized service companies to service and maintain our products 
services we provide include project management  on site installation and event support  content creation  product maintenance  marketing assistance and display rentals 
our keyframe support group provides a variety of services to customers  including video and animation support  event support  control room design  on site training hardware and software  and continuing technical support for operators of complicated display systems 
our daktronics sports marketing division provides customers primarily sports facilities with a complete display system  funded in part through value added marketing services 
these marketing services extend beyond the marketing potential of the equipment in the facility to other facility related components 
typically  these services are limited to facilities that do not have in house marketing programs and staff 
our daktronics commercial network division provides services similar to daktronics sports marketing to narrowly defined niches within our commercial market 
these services entail maximizing revenue generation for customers in connection with the purchase of display systems through advertising and other opportunities 
customer service and support 
our prompt and reliable customer service distinguishes us from our competitors 
this service includes limited warranties for most of our products against failure due to defective parts or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to five years after first sale or installation  depending on the product or type of customer 
we also provide help desk access  parts repair and replacement and programming support for video  animation and other displays 
we staff our help desk with experienced technicians who are available at the desk or on call hours a day to support events and sites 
our repair center is staffed with trained technicians who promptly repair and return components that require service  and we offer a component exchange program for same day shipment of replacement parts 
our modular approach to the design and production of products enhances our ability to provide effective customer service and support 
customers can obtain periodic training and maintenance seminars throughout the world and at our headquarters and can also contract for on site training and maintenance for certain types of installations  such as high profile sports events 
general description of our products and technologies our display technology has changed significantly since the mid s when incandescent lamps were the primary display element 
presently  led and liquid crystal display lcd technologies are the primary display elements 
the invention and availability of the blue and green led  along with the already available red led  allowed the introduction of full color video displays using leds as the primary colors forming all other colors in the video display 
the decreasing costs of lcd components along with the drive for more numerous smaller displays led to the addition of lcd displays 
finally  driven by customer demand  we have enhanced our video display technology into mobile and modular technologies to complement various applications  which are not fixed and permanent in nature 
we now offer led products across our entire product line 
the availability of improved  cost effective red and amber leds has made them the preferred display element for large monochrome displays  replacing both incandescent and reflective technologies in most applications 
the cost effectiveness  life and performance of lcds have made them the preferred indoor small display solution 
the vast majority of displays we sell today utilize led technology 
the two principal components of many of our systems are the display and the display controller 
the display controller uses computer hardware and software to process the information provided by the operator and other integrated sources and then compiles the information  graphics or animation to be presented on the display 
data can be transferred between the display controller and local or remote displays 
local connections may use copper wire cables  fiber optic cables  infrared links or radio links 
standard  cellular telephone connections and satellite transmissions are used to connect to remote displays 
the display controller controls each of the pixels which are the dots or picture elements that make up the image on the display to present the message or image 
most of our display technologies rely on one or more of our software products to manage and provide content for the display 
these software products range from scoring consoles to the venus display control software that allows the creation  display and scheduling of dynamic text and basic graphics content on electronic displays to the venus display control system that controls multi color displays and video boards  providing the ability to create graphics and animation as well as interfacing with third party software for content 
additionally  our v net tm control software is used to display targeted messages to specific audiences 
complementary software  such as our dakstats and interfacing software  is also available and can be fully integrated into the control software 
our display systems range from small scoreboards under  to large complex display systems priced in excess of million 
generally  our product sales are either custom products or standard catalog scoreboards or displays 
these standard catalog sales account for approximately of our total annual revenues 
our custom products are customized in terms of size  configuration and installation type but are built utilizing standard physical and technology platforms 
within each product family  we produce both standard and custom displays that vary in complexity  size and resolution 
the physical dimensions of a display depend on the size of the viewing area  the distance from the viewer to the display and the amount and type of information to be displayed 
generally  the light source or pixels are spaced farther apart for longer distance viewing 
the type of the display may also depend on the location of the viewing audience 
for example  arena scoreboards may have a viewing angle nearly as wide as degrees  compared with roadside displays  which typically are viewed from a passing vehicle only within a narrow angle from the display 
we customize our products according to the design specifications of the customer and the conditions of the environment and setting 
product families and technologies our products are comprised of the following four major product families sport products  primarily all sport  tuff sport and omnisport scoreboards  controllers and timing systems  video products  primarily prostar  protour and proad displays  and associated control systems  commercial products  primarily galaxy displays and venus control systems  transportation products  primarily vanguard displays each of these product families is discussed below 
sport products 
the sport products family includes a full line of indoor and outdoor scoreboards  timing systems  digit displays  sound systems  statistics software and other related products 
the indoor products  which are available in led technologies  range from two digit shot clocks and small scoreboards to large  center hung scoreboards incorporating message centers and advertising panels 
outdoor scoreboards  which are available in led and incandescent technologies  also range from two digit game timers and small scoreboards to large scoring systems incorporating message centers and advertising panels 
the sizes of displays can vary significantly depending on the needs of the customer  taking into account such things as viewing angles and spectator distances 
we expect that sport products sales in the future will continue to focus on led technology due to the lower power consumption  longer life and resulting lower maintenance costs as compared to other technologies 
substantially all sport products sales are led technology 
since most of the products within the sport products group have significant standardization  we have been able to make progress on our goal to deliver the highest quality products while maintaining consistent and favorable margins 
we offer a variety of internally developed controllers complementing our scoreboards and displays  which vary depending on the sport and complexity of the system 
these controllers vary in price and complexity from the all sport  which is an entry level controller for scoreboards  to the all sport  which is designed for more sophisticated scoring systems allowing for more user defined options 
these controllers can be interfaced with the scoreboards through radio frequencies  fiber optic connections or other means 
we also offer timing systems for sports events  primarily aquatics and track competitions 
these timing systems include our omnisport timing system 
the system has the capability to not only time and rank the competitors but also to interface to event management software created by other third parties to facilitate the administration of the sporting event 
as a key component of an integrated system  we market sports statistics and results software under the dakstats trademark 
the software allows entry and display of sports statistics and other information displays 
it is the leading application of its type in professional  collegiate and high school baseball and other sports 
video products 
the video products family consists primarily of displays comprised of a large number of pixels capable of creating various levels of video  graphics and animation and controllers  which manage the operation of the display 
video display products are based on red  green and blue leds arranged in various combinations to form pixels or picture elements 
the electronic circuitry which controls the pixels allows for variances in the relative brightness of each led to provide a full color spectrum  thereby displaying video images in striking  vibrant colors 
we offer a wide range of video display products for different applications and budgets 
variables in typical video displays include the spacing of the pixels pixel pitch  the brightness of the displays  the number of discrete colors that the display is able to produce color resolution  and the viewing angle 
in addition  modular design allows the product to be readily configured in custom sizes to meet each customer s specific requirements  with no maximum to the size of display that can be built 
in general  the more pixels and the more color resolution  the better the video image on the display 
our prostar video display systems offer specifications second to none in the industry 
at the high end  the product is capable of producing trillion colors and is available with pixel spacing as close as three millimeters 
currently  we offer a wide range of pixel spacing  ranging from millimeter to millimeter 
the millimeter application provides the user with the greatest pixel density and shortest viewing distance and the millimeter is the most cost effective for physically large displays with maximum viewing distances 
in addition  the uniformity of colors across the display is important to the quality of the video image 
our unique display control circuitry along with proprietary manufacturing and calibration procedures provide uniform colors across the display 
we have adapted our prostar technology into our proad digital advertising and information display system  the protour modular display system  the prorail display systems and our propixel tm display systems 
proad technology uses similar red  green and blue led modules configured in different height to width ratios to give arena and stadium facilities the ability to install long  narrower bands of displays in various locations in the facility 
this application generally serves as a revenue generation source for facilities through advertising as well as a location to display information such as scoring  statistics and video designed to entertain and inform the spectators 
protour display systems are comprised of lightweight individual modules or panels less than a square meter in size that are assembled together to form a display in a customizable height and width 
these panels are focused in what we refer to as the mobile and modular application such as touring shows and the events market 
prorail display systems incorporate our proad technology into a patented cabinet designed to serve as a replacement for the fascia of an upper deck in a stadium or arena  in some cases  improving site lines of the fans 
propixel displays  which were recently introduced  serve as an architectural accents and channel lettering 
our main controller for these video displays is our venus controller  which is built on the windows operating system 
this high end controller provides advanced capability for controlling large video displays 
the v play event management software provides facilities with integrated and sophisticated event program management capabilities with integration to video equipment 
it provides instant replays  live action and overlays of information  and it allows for the organization and playback of digital video and audio clips 
other video products controllers include the v net tm  v tour and v show controllers 
each of these controllers is designed with unique features and functionality designed for unique market niches 
our v tour design interfaces between our display systems and other systems  allowing  for example  scoreboard and video systems to receive and display information from computers used for statistics  timing or scoring 
these interfaces allow the display controller to send information back to a statistics system or customer computer and can automatically report continually updated sports scores and information from national wire services 
commercial products 
the key product line in the commercial products family is the galaxy product line  which includes various indoor and outdoor applications intended primarily as graphics and text based displays 
all of the current product offerings within the commercial products group utilize led technologies 
galaxy displays  available in both indoor and outdoor models  have become our leading product line for commercial applications and are expected to be a key product line for growth in the future 
galaxy displays are either red  amber or full color with pixel spacing ranging from millimeter to millimeter  depending on size and viewing distance 
they are used primarily as message centers to convey information and advertising to the consumers and the public 
this product line has become our fastest growing product line 
the modular design of the product allows us to configure a display to readily meet the size requirements of each customer 
within the galaxy line  we offer various price points for similar sized displays of the same pixel spacing 
other product lines within the business products group include our datatrac  dakticker and infonet displays 
the datatrac product lines consist of indoor led displays comprised of discrete characters 
each character is spaced horizontally and vertically from the adjacent character 
this provides the least expensive display per character for display of text messages only 
dakticker displays are used primarily in financial institutions for ticker displays and other financial information 
the infonet product line includes line oriented displays for indoor use that are available as single or multi line units 
all datatrac  dakticker and infonet products have a controller in the display that is capable of receiving a downloaded display program and then operating independently to display that program until a new program is downloaded to it 
the majority of our commercial products group s products utilize our proprietary venus display control software to control the creation of messages and graphic sequences for downloading to the display 
this software is designed to be useable without any special training  and it is applicable to all general advertising or message presentation applications 
we also provide software that allows oem customers system integrators to write their own software using the venus software developer s kit to communicate to other displays supplied by us 
several system integrators have implemented the venus protocol into their specific applications  resulting in additional display sales 
transportation products 
the transportation products group includes a full line of electronic displays and controllers marketed under the vanguard product line 
vanguard displays are typically used to help direct traffic and inform motorists 
we have also developed a control system for these displays to help manage a network of displays 
both the led based displays and the software are ntcip national transportation communications for its protocol compliant and meet the various requirements imposed by government and other regulatory bodies 
sources of raw materials we source a portion of our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers 
these include primarily leds and are due to the nature of the quality required 
the loss of any single supplier  however  would not have a material effect 
in addition  to reduce our inventories and enhance product quality  we elect to limit the number of suppliers who are willing to provide components on an as needed basis 
from time to time  we enter into pricing agreements or purchasing contracts under which we agree to purchase a minimum amount of product in exchange for guaranteed price terms over the course of the contract  which generally do not exceed one year 
intellectual property we develop patentable technology on a continuing basis 
we hold a number of us and foreign patents and have a number of patent applications pending 
the patents pertain primarily to our led display technologies and product features 
we rely on trademarks  in addition to patents  to help establish and preserve limited proprietary protection for our products 
our trademarks are registered in the united states and several other countries 
we also have numerous trademark applications pending 
these trademarks are used to establish brand recognition and distinction in our various markets 
product drawings  software and other works of authorship are also subject to applicable copyright law protections 
we provide software to our customers in machine readable object code to help preserve its confidentiality 
we also rely on nondisclosure agreements with our employees 
despite these intellectual property protections  there can be no assurance that a competitor will not copy the functions or features of our products 
seasonal nature of the business our sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for facilities where professional and major college sports events take place  and large commercial systems 
the seasonality of the sports market has also played a part in our sales and profit fluctuations 
as a result  sales and net income in the first and second quarters of a fiscal year tend to be higher than in the third quarter of that fiscal year  followed by higher levels in the fourth quarter  leading into the first quarter of the following year 
this seasonality is caused by sales related to facilities for football and other fall sports in the summer and early fall  followed by sales generally related to facilities for basketball and hockey in the fall  and finally facilities for baseball and other spring and summer sports in the early to late spring 
this seasonal effect is generally compounded by large product orders in the sports markets and by the effects of holidays during the third quarter 
the effects of seasonality not related to holidays are generally not found in our commercial and transportation markets  although the impact of large orders in those markets can cause significant fluctuations in sales and profits 
approximately of our sales are in the sports markets  percent in the commercial market  and the remainder in transportation 
gross margins on large orders tend to fluctuate more than those for smaller  standard orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins with greater variability in margins and are subject to greater competitive factors 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for these larger orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect that our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations 
working capital items on large product orders  the time between order accrual and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
customers the primary markets we serve  along with types of customers  are as follows markets types of customers sports elementary and secondary schools  colleges and universities  recreation centers  professional sports teams and facilities  olympic games  national and international sports federations  civic arenas and convention centers and motor racing 
commercial retailers  hospitality providers  quick serve restaurants  outdoor advertisers  financial institutions  casinos  pari mutual racing and other businesses 
transportation state and local departments of transportation  airlines  airports and related industries  parking facilities and transit authorities 
we have a large and diverse customer base 
as a result  the loss of a major customer would not have an adverse impact on us 
no single customer accounted for more than of our revenue in fiscal year backlog our backlog consists of customer sales agreements or purchase orders that we expect to fill within the next months and was approximately million as of april  and million as of may  because sales agreements and purchase orders are typically subject to cancellation or delay by customers with limited or no penalty  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales or net income 
while orders for many of our products may be shipped within days  other orders may take longer depending on the customer s project schedule or other factors 
government and other regulation in the united states and other countries  various laws and regulations  including zoning ordinances  restrict the installation of outdoor signs and displays  particularly in the commercial market 
these regulations may impose greater restrictions on electronic displays due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety if a moving display is located near a road or highway 
these factors may prevent or inhibit us from selling products to some prospective customers 
some of our products are tested to safety standards developed by underwriters laboratories in the united states  as well as similar standards in other countries 
we design and produce our products in accordance with these standards 
our printed circuit board manufacturing operations use certain chemical processes that are subject to various environmental rules and regulations 
our manufacturing operations must also meet various safety related rules and regulations 
we believe we are in compliance with all applicable governmental laws and regulations 
competition the large electronic display industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition from a variety of sources 
there are a number of established manufacturers of competing products who may have greater market penetration in certain market niches or greater financial  marketing and other resources 
competitors might also attempt to copy our products or product features 
because a customer s budget for the purchase of a large screen electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  we may also compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
many of our competitors compete in only one or a few of the market niches we serve 
there are generally more competitors in markets that require less complicated display systems  such as the high school scoreboard market and the commercial market  including banks and small retail store displays 
as the needs of a customer increase and the display systems become more complex  there are generally fewer competitors 
however  due to the high profile nature of larger complex display systems  the competition may be more intense 
during fiscal year and into  there was a considerable amount of change in competitors in the video display portion of our business 
the changes included new competitors and consolidation of competitors 
in addition  in fiscal year  we began to experience greater pricing pressures from competitors who seem to be attempting to gather market share at the expense of profits 
although these changes have an impact on the market as a whole  we are confident that we can continue to grow and expand our business because of our experience and approach to the market 
we compete based on our broad range of products and features  complementary services  advanced technology  prompt delivery  and reliable and readily available customer service and support 
we also strive to provide cost effective products and solutions for our customers 
contrary to our focus on technologically advanced products and customer support  certain companies compete in some markets by providing lower cost display systems  which are of a lesser quality with lower product performance or customer support 
if a customer focuses principally on price  we are less likely to obtain the sale 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance our existing products  introduce new products and product features  and provide customers with cost effective solutions to their display needs 
research and development we believe our engineering capability and experience are unparalleled among our competitors and our product development capability will continue to be a very important factor in our market position 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were approximately   and  respectively 
environmental concerns we believe that we do not have any environmental issues which would materially affect capital expenditures  earnings or our competitive position in the marketplace 
employees as of april   we employed  full time employees and part time and temporary employees 
of these employees  approximately were in manufacturing  in sales  marketing and customer service  in engineering  and in administration

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview we design  manufacture and sell a wide range of display systems to customers in a variety of markets throughout the world 
we focus our sales and marketing efforts on geographical regions  markets and products 
the primary categories of markets include sports  commercial and transportation markets 
our net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for professional sports facilities and colleges and universities  as well as the seasonality of the sports market 
net sales also have fluctuated due to other seasonality factors  including the timing of the various sports seasons and the impact of holidays  which primarily impact our third quarter 
our gross margins on large product orders tend to fluctuate more than those for smaller standard orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for large custom orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect that our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations 
we operate on a to week fiscal year  with fiscal years ending on the saturday closest to april of each year 
fiscal year contained weeks  and the first quarter of fiscal year contained weeks as compared to the more typical week year and week quarter 
for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements and the effects of those pronouncements on our financial results  refer to note of our financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to estimated total costs on long term contracts  estimated costs to be incurred for product warranties and extended maintenance contracts  bad debts  excess and obsolete inventory and contingencies 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term contracts 
earnings on long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are estimable 
generally  contracts entered into have fixed prices established  and to the extent the actual costs to complete contracts are higher than the amounts estimated as of the date of the financial statements  the resulting gross margin would be negatively affected in future quarters when we revise our estimates 
our practice is to revise estimates as soon as any such changes in estimates are known 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to identify impairment in the customer s ability to pay  we review aging reports  contact customers in connection with collection efforts and review other available information 
as of april   we had an allowance for doubtful accounts balance of approximately million 
warranties 
we have created a reserve for warranties on our products equal to our estimate of the actual costs to be incurred in connection with our performance under the warranties 
generally  estimates are based on historical experience taking into account known or expected changes 
if we would become aware of an increase in our warranty reserves  additional reserves may become necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
as of april   we had a total of approximately million reserved for warranty costs 
extended warranty and product maintenance 
we have deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements 
the deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term 
if we would become aware of an increase in our estimated costs under these agreements in excess of our deferred revenue  additional reserves may be necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
in determining if additional reserves are necessary  we examine cost trends on the contracts and other information and compare that to the deferred revenue 
as of april   we had million of deferred revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market refers to the current replacement cost  except that market may not exceed the net realizable value that is  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonable predictable costs of completion and disposal  and market is not less than the net realizable value reduced by an allowance for normal profit margins 
in valuing inventory  we estimate market value where it is believed to be the lower of cost or market  and any necessary charges are charged to costs of goods sold in the period in which it occurs 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended april   may  and may  years ended april  may  may  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income net sales fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year net sales increased in our sports and commercial markets and declined slightly in our transportation market 
net sales increased on a domestic basis and declined internationally 
as a percent of overall net sales  standard product sales were approximately of total net sales 
we began to see much greater competition in the video products area of our business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as compared to prior periods 
we believe that this competitive level will continue into fiscal year  but that in the long term  the competitive environment will revert back to levels more consistent with prior years 
we have begun to see the effect this competition has had on weakening certain competitors  and we are optimistic that we can improve our performance during fiscal year we also intend to maintain our market share during this period of more intense competition and to continue our history of growing market share 
we believe that as a result of our diversification  mix of products and services and various other factors  we will be able to continue to grow sales in excess of  annually over the long term 
the increase in net sales in the sports market resulted from an increase in sales to mid sized and small facilities which was offset by a decline in professional sports facilities 
in addition  net sales increased on a domestic basis in the sports market but declined on an international basis 
the sports market is subject to volatility based on the timing of large orders  especially orders for professional facilities  which causes net sales as a whole to fluctuate year to year 
the mid sized and smaller facilities experience more consistency in growth rates due to the greater number of facilities 
as a whole  the number of new construction and major renovations for professional facilities in fiscal year was down as compared to  but is expected to increase slightly in fiscal year in addition  we had expected a greater rate of growth on transactions supported by our sports marketing division  which grew at a lower rate then expected 
these two factors  plus the general risk of timing of orders led to the overall lower than expected growth rate 
the growth in the mid sized and smaller facilities is the result of factors similar to prior years  including the expanding market  with smaller facilities spending more on larger  more complicated display systems  our product and services offering  which remains the most integrated and comprehensive offering in the industry  and our network of sales and service offices  which are important to support our customers 
we believe that the effects of the economy have a lesser impact on the sports market as compared to our other markets because our products are generally revenue generation tools through advertising for facilities and the sports business in general is a recession resistant business 
orders as opposed to net sales in the sports market performed much better in fiscal year as compared to this improved performance is due to the same reasons indicated for the increase in net sales in the sports market 
the growth in orders was in the same niches as net sales 
on an international basis  orders declined in fiscal year from fiscal year which we attribute to its inherent volatility 
the increase in net sales in the commercial market for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year exceeded on a worldwide basis  with much of the increase coming from growth domestically 
the commercial market grew on an international basis as well  with net sales up over in fiscal year as compared to the growth includes better performance in custom contracts and standard products 
this improved performance continued due to the benefit of an expanding line of products  a growing distribution network and growth in product acceptance  as commercial establishments better understand the advantages of electronic displays as an advertising media 
these positive factors are partially offset by the constraints that exist in the marketplace related to obtaining permits to install outdoor electronic displays 
in addition  we are seeing more interest in the commercial market for custom video systems  as prices on video displays have been declining and have become more affordable  expanding the market for their use 
growth in the commercial market depends on the state of the economy  which was not affected in fiscal year as compared to the increase in orders for the year in this market was due to the same factors affecting net sales 
we believe that the commercial market will continue to see growth in the future 
we also believe that sales in the commercial market are expected to continue expanding at rates faster than in other markets 
finally  we believe that national account business could lead to faster growth rates depending on our success in booking orders in this niche 
the decrease in net sales in the transportation market in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due primarily to a decline in business in the aviation niche of this market  which we attribute to the state of the airline industry 
net sales of our standard vanguard r product line increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in our core transportation segment  primarily vanguard displays  was due to growing product acceptance and importance in managing traffic and informing motorists 
in addition  orders  excluding the aviation niche  were up almost in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a result of current legislation in congress related to federal spending on transportation  we are optimistic that the government will fund increases in spending within the intelligent transportation segment of the transportation market  which would benefit us by providing funds to purchase our products 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year net sales in all three of our markets increased in fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in sports markets was across all components  from smaller institutions  such as high schools and recreation centers  to professional sports facilities 
the most significant area of growth was in the professional sports facilities as a result of a number of large contracts signed during fiscal year and in the prior fiscal year 
we believe that sales in the sports market increased in fiscal year due primarily to an expanding market as our products have become more affordable  the number of and quality of additional services we offered to customers  such as sports marketing services  and our overall product offerings  which we believe are the most complete and integrated systems in the marketplace 
in addition  we benefited from our network of sales and service offices located throughout the united states and canada and  beginning in fiscal year  in europe  giving us the ability to serve our customers more effectively 
finally  during the second half of fiscal year  there were significant changes in the mix of competitors seeking business in the united states sports market  while at the same time  we aggressively pursued business outside of north america 
orders in the sports markets were also up during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in all areas 
most of the increase in order bookings was concentrated in the professional sports facilities and the smaller sports facilities for substantially similar reasons as described above 
the increase in net sales for the commercial market was the result of the factors indicated for growth in fiscal year in addition  we focused on sales to national accounts  primarily retail organizations and billboard companies  with greater success beginning in fiscal year during the year  sales to this area of the market increased significantly due to increased sales to a limited number of national accounts 
the increase in sales in the transportation market was due to a number of factors  including the overall product offerings and our efforts in previous years to grow and develop our relationships with customers  including departments of transportation and transportation system integrators  resulting in repeat sales 
backlog our backlog at the end of fiscal year was approximately million as compared to approximately million at the end of fiscal year the growth in the backlog as a percent of fiscal year backlog was the highest in the commercial market due to increased volume and the effects of a few larger orders booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal year backlog also increased over fiscal year in the sports and transportation markets 
overall  the increase was the result of the record quarter we experienced in order bookings as compared to previous quarters 
backlog varies significantly quarter to quarter due to the effects of large orders  and significant variations can be expected as explained previously herein 
in addition  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales or net income  also as explained previously 
we occasionally sell products in exchange for advertising revenues from the scoreboard or display 
these revenues represented less than of net sales for each of fiscal years  and the gross profit margin on these net sales has historically been comparable to or higher than the gross profit margin on other net sales of similar sized installations 
gross profit fiscal year as compared to fiscal year gross profit increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year as a percent of net sales  gross profit decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher level of net sales discussed above  offset by a decline in the gross profit percentage 
the decrease in the percentage was due to a number of factors  including a much more competitive environment  especially in the second half of fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  much less contribution derived from lower raw materials costs  as we did not experience the level of price declines in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  higher freight costs  lower absorption of overhead costs  as we planned for greater sales which did not occur due to order delays  the decline in on site favorable variances  and various other factors 
we continue to strive towards higher gross margins as a percent of net sales  although depending on the competitive environment  the actual mix and level of future sales and other factors as described elsewhere  margin percentages may not increase and could decrease from the level of fiscal year fiscal year as compared to fiscal year gross profit increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year as a percent of net sales  gross profit increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher level of net sales discussed above and an improvement in the gross profit as a percent of net sales 
the increase in the gross profit margins as a percent of net sales was due to a number of factors  including lower raw materials costs  the benefits of signing orders in advance of raw material price declines that were not foreseen at the time of booking the orders  improvements in on site project costs as compared to estimates  improvements in the expected margin at contract signing  improved overhead absorption in manufacturing  and an improved mix between higher margin standard products and large contracts 
these improvements were offset by higher freight costs due to the growth in standard product orders and inventory losses due to more conservative inventory management and obsolescence 
operating expenses fiscal year as compared to fiscal year operating expenses  which are comprised of selling  general and administrative and product design and development costs  increased by approximately from million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year the changes in the various components of operating expenses are explained below 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year for fiscal year  operating expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year for fiscal year  all components of operating expenses were affected as a result of the year containing weeks as opposed to the weeks included in fiscal year in addition  during the fiscal year ended may   we incurred higher profit sharing plan contributions than in fiscal year  which affected all areas 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  travel and entertainment expenses  facilities related costs for sales and service offices  and expenditures for marketing efforts  including the costs of collateral materials  conventions and trade shows  product demos and supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling expenses increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in selling expense  both in terms of dollars and as a percent of net sales  resulted from higher levels of personnel costs  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation  commissions on sales  and other costs associated with a higher number of employees 
the increase in the number of employees was planned and corresponded to the growth in order bookings during the fiscal year  which was up over in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the planned increase in the number of employees was also due to hiring additional personnel to support various investments made into growing areas  such as sports marketing  narrowcasting  international operations  the increased number of domestic sales and service offices  and the two smaller acquisitions during fiscal year the increase in travel and entertainment expense is due to having more employees in fiscal year  in addition to some one time marketing events we sponsored and the increased investment in the international market 
higher depreciation costs are primarily due to the increased investment in demonstration products 
higher commissions resulted from the higher level of sales 
these increases were offset by lower employee benefit costs 
we expect that although we will continue to invest in organic growth because we believe the risk to be less than that incurred with acquisitions  selling expense is expected to decline in the first quarter of fiscal year as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year this expectation could change based on how much investment ultimately is required in current initiatives underway  including our development of a presence in china and various other locations protour video displays associated with narrowcasting and other items 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling expenses increased to million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in selling expense dollars resulted from higher levels of personnel and related infrastructure  higher travel and entertainment costs related to international business and regional support initiatives  greater depreciation costs related to demonstration equipment and higher marketing and sales literature costs focused primarily on the larger sports venues as that market became more competitive 
these increases were offset by lower bad debt expense and lower write downs of demonstration equipment  as explained below 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  professional fees  shareholder relations costs  facilities and equipment related costs for administrative departments  training costs  amortization of intangibles  and the costs of supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year general and administrative costs increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percent of net sales  general and administrative expenses were for both fiscal years and the increase was due to higher costs of personnel and related infrastructure to support our growth  higher professional fees in large part due to the costs of the research and development tax analysis discussed below  higher training costs  as we placed more emphasis on training  especially new employees  higher information systems costs and the costs related to the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of we expect that for fiscal year  general and administrative expenses will decline as a percent of sales but will increase in total dollars 
this could change based on the level of investment required for continued compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the extent of costs associated with international expansion opportunities 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year general and administrative costs increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase was due to higher costs of personnel and related infrastructure to support our growth  higher professional fees associated with international expansion and sales  patent and other intellectual property matters  implementation of portions of the sarbanes oxley act of  higher employee relations costs  higher costs of information systems infrastructure  more charitable contributions  and increased insurance rates related to growth 
these costs were partially offset by a decline in shareholder relations costs 
product design and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  and facilities and equipment related costs and supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year product development expenses increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percent of sales  product development expenses were and of net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
product development activities increased in all four of our product families during fiscal the most significant investment we made during fiscal year was the development of our new protour tm product line as described elsewhere in this report 
the development costs were greater than we expected and are the primary factor in causing product development expenses to exceed our target of of net sales 
this development included two product releases and tooling and related components that were duplicative costs as we improved our design 
during fiscal year  we introduced a number of other new products  in addition to our protour tm line  including enhanced and new controllers  improvements in our sports software and standard displays across all product development groups  and our newest generation of our prostar r technology 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year product development expenses increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percent of sales  product development expenses were of net sales for both fiscal years and product development activities increased in all four of our product families during fiscal and generally focused in the same areas as in fiscal year as we enhanced and expanded our product offerings 
the transportation products area contained the greatest percentage growth increase  followed by business products 
during fiscal year  we introduced a number of new products including the galaxy series displays  the v net tm narrowcasting solution  and the three millimeter prostar series  which resulted in increased product development expenditures 
we also improved its controllers  displays and software solutions 
interest income we occasionally sell products on an installment basis  under lease arrangements or in exchange for the rights to sell and retain advertising revenues from displays  which result in long term receivables 
we also invest excess cash in marketable securities and temporary cash investments that generate interest income 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest income increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year interest income was approximately and of net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase was attributable to the growth of temporary cash investments and marketable securities as a result of the increased cash flow during the year 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest income increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year interest income was approximately and of net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase was attributable to the growth in long term receivables related to financing customer transactions and the growth of temporary cash investments and marketable securities created as a result of the increased cash flow during the year 
interest expense interest expense is comprised primarily of interest cost on our notes payable and other long term debt 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest expense decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal year the decline was the result of lower levels of debt outstanding during the year 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest expense decreased to million as compared to million in fiscal year the decline was the result of lower overall levels of debt outstanding under term loans during fiscal year income taxes fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income taxes decreased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this decrease was principally due to lower pre tax income and the benefits associated with research and development tax credits 
during fiscal year  we reviewed our prior years claims for research and development tax credits and concluded that additional research and development expenses qualified for the credit 
as a result  we amended our returns for fiscal years though  realizing additional research and development tax credits in excess of million 
included in general and administrative costs were professional fees of approximately million associated with this effort 
the effective rate of for fiscal year compares to in fiscal year the change in the effective rate is primarily due to the benefit of this credit related to prior years 
we expect that the effective rate will increase in fiscal year to a range of to  depending on the effects of recent repeal of the extraterritorial tax deduction  discussed below  and the effect of state income taxes  which vary from year to year based on the location of larger projects 
over the course of the last three years  the world trade organization wto has ruled that the provisions contained in the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of eti are prohibited export subsidies under the rules of the wto 
federal legislation was recently signed into law that repealed eti in the future in favor of a deduction relating to income attributable to domestic production activities 
we have not yet fully evaluated the provisions of this new legislation  however  the eti is being phased out over time beginning in calendar year  when the eti benefits get reduced to 
the new provisions will allow a deduction that could reduce taxable income by  or of qualified production activities income  whichever is less 
the full benefit of this provision will not be achieved until the effects on future years are being evaluated 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income taxes increased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase was principally due to the higher net income on a pre tax basis 
the effective rate of for fiscal year compares to in fiscal year the change in the effective rate is primarily due to the level of international sales  which generate a tax deduction  as well as lower anticipated state income taxes due to the mix of business by state 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at april  as compared to million at may  we have historically financed working capital needs through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit agreements 
cash provided by operations for fiscal year was million 
net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of approximately million and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and customer deposits and decreases in accounts receivable were offset by increases in long term receivables  inventories and income taxes receivable 
cash used by investing activities consisted of million used to purchase property and equipment 
during fiscal year  we invested approximately million in equipment to be used as demonstration equipment  primarily related to new product introductions  including our new protour tm video display and related components  updated versions of our prostar video display  and trailer mounted versions of our standard galaxy product line  approximately million in new facilities  including million expansion of our manufacturing facilities in brookings  south dakota and million in office space and production facilities in clearwater  florida  approximately million in manufacturing equipment  consisting of tooling for new product lines  electronic assembly equipment and various other items  approximately million on information systems hardware and software  approximately million in office furnishings and equipment  and approximately million in various other items 
these purchases were made to support our continued growth and to replace obsolete equipment 
finally  during fiscal year  we invested approximately million in marketable securities  primarily long term  tax exempt  auction rate securities 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we made two acquisitions costing us approximately million in cash for the operating assets of dodge electronics  inc and of the outstanding stock of european timing systems  ltd 
included in the acquisitions was approximately million of goodwill 
cash used by financing activities included approximately million  net  used to pay down our long term debt and million in payments on our notes payable offset by approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
included in receivables as of april  was approximately million of retainage on long term contracts  all of which is expected to be collected in one year 
we have used and expect to continue to use cash reserves and  to a lesser extent  as necessary  bank borrowings to meet our short term working capital requirements 
on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these product orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and other expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
our product development activities include the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products from existing technologies 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were million  million  and million  respectively 
we intend to continue to incur these expenditures to develop new display products and solutions using various technologies to offer higher resolution and more cost effective and energy efficient displays  as well as to complement the services and solutions that are provided with the displays 
we also intend to continue developing software applications related to our display systems to enable these products to continue to meet the needs and expectations of the marketplace 
credit agreements we have a credit agreement with a bank which provides for a million line of credit and which includes up to million for standby letters of credit 
the line of credit is due on october  the interest rate on the line of credit is equal to libor plus at april  
as of april   no advances under the line of credit were outstanding 
the credit agreement is unsecured and requires us to comply with certain covenants  including the maintenance of tangible net worth of at least million  a minimum liquidity ratio  a limit on dividends and distributions  and a minimum adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio 
daktronics canada  inc has a credit agreement with a bank which provides for a million line of credit 
the line of credit is due on july  the interest rate on the line of credit is equal to above the prime rate of interest at april  
as of april   million had been drawn under the line 
the line of credit is secured primarily by accounts receivables  inventory and other assets of the subsidiary 
we are sometimes required to obtain performance bonds for display installations 
we currently have a bonding line available through a surety company that provides for an aggregate of million in bonded work outstanding 
at april   we had million of bonded work outstanding against this line 
we believe that if our growth extends beyond current expectations or if we make any strategic investments  we may need to increase the amount of our credit facility 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain any needed funds under commercially reasonable terms from our current lender or other sources 
we believe that our working capital available from all sources will be adequate to meet the cash requirements of our operations in the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commitments we enter into various debt  lease  purchase and marketing obigations that require payments in future periods 
debt obligations represent primarily bank loans 
lease obligations relate primarily of leased office space 
marketing obligations relate to payment due in future periods for payments due for those sales where we sold and installed our equipment in exhange for future advertising revenue 
when certain advertising revenues are met  the excess cash is owed back to the customer 
contractual cash obligations represent future payments for inventory and advertising rights purchase commitments 
as of april   our debt  lease and purchase obligations were as follows contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt  long term marketing obligations operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations contractual cash obligations    other commercial commitments lines of credit standby letters of credit   guarantees total commercial commitments   inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or our financial condition  although it could in the future 
business risks and uncertainties a number of risks and uncertainties exist which could impact our future operating results 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  competition  our success in developing new products and technologies  market acceptance of new products  and other factors  including those set forth below 
competition could result in lower sales and decreased margins 
we operate in highly competitive markets that  in certain portions of the business  are highly fragmented 
in addition  because a customer s budget for the purchase of an electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  our products often compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
competition could result in not only a reduction in net sales but also in the prices charged by us for our products 
to remain competitive  we must be able to not only anticipate and respond quickly to our customers needs and enhance and upgrade our existing products and services to meet those needs but also continue to price our products competitively 
our competitors may develop cheaper  more efficient products or may be willing to charge lower prices for strategic marketing or to increase market share 
some competitors have more capital and resources than we do and may be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements 
our business may suffer if we are not successful in our efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing product market 
the electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in display and controller technology 
competitors could develop new or superior products to increase their share of the markets 
our future success in addressing the needs of our customers will depend in part on our ability to continue to make timely and cost effective product innovations and developments 
we enter into fixed priced contracts on a regular basis 
if our actual costs exceed original estimates on these contracts  our profits will be reduced 
the majority of contracts we enter into are on a fixed price basis 
although we benefit from cost savings  we have a limited ability to recover cost overruns 
because of the large scale and long duration of some contracts  unanticipated cost increases may occur as a result of several factors including  but not limited to  increases in the cost or shortages of components  materials or labor  unanticipated technical problems  required project modifications not initiated by the customer  and suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform or delay in performing their obligations 
these factors could delay delivery of products  and contracts may provide for liquidated damages for late delivery 
unanticipated costs that cannot be passed on to customers or the payment of liquidated damages under fixed contracts would negatively impact profits 
backlog may not be indicative of future revenue 
customers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control 
orders normally contain cancellation provisions which permit the recovery of costs expended and a portion of the anticipated profit in the event a customer cancels an order 
if a customer elects to cancel  we may not realize the full amount of revenues included in our backlog 
if projects are delayed  the timing of revenues could be affected  and projects may remain in the backlog for extended periods of time 
revenue recognition occurs over longer periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays 
if we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter  fluctuations in the levels of the quarterly backlog can result because the backlog in that quarter may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent quarters 
for these reasons  backlog may not be indicative of future revenues 
our ability to conduct business outside the united states may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control and  as such  net sales and profits from international sales could be adversely impacted 
for fiscal year  revenue outside the united states represented approximately of our consolidated net sales 
in fiscal  approximately of our consolidated net sales were derived from sales outside the united states 
our operations and earnings throughout the world have been  and may in the future be  affected from time to time in varying degrees by war  political developments  foreign laws and regulations  regional economic uncertainty  political instability  restrictions  customs and tariffs  changing regulatory environments  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and adverse tax consequences 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect on us vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 
these factors may result in a decline in net sales or profitability and could adversely affect our ability to expand our business outside of the united states 
our financial performance may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  making it difficult to estimate future revenue 
our quarterly revenues and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
contracts we enter into generally stipulate customer specific delivery terms and may have contract cycles of a year or more  which subjects them to many factors beyond our control 
furthermore  because a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed  an unanticipated delay or cancellation of orders in backlog may have a significant negative impact on our quarterly operating results 
therefore  quarterly operating results may be subject to significant variations  and operating performance in one quarter may not be indicative of future performance 
our products are covered by warranties 
unanticipated warranty costs for defective products could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and reputation 
we provide warranties on our products generally for terms of five years or less in the case of standard products and one year or less in the case of custom orders 
in addition  in response to customer needs  we regularly offer extended warranties 
these warranties require us to repair or replace faulty products and meet certain performance standards  among other customary warranty provisions 
although we continually monitor our warranty claims and provide a reserve for estimated warranty issues on an on going basis  an unanticipated claim could have a material adverse impact on operations 
in some cases  we may be able to subrogate a claim back to a subcontractor or supplier if the subcontractor or supplier supplied the defective product or performed the service  but this may not always be possible 
the need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could temporarily delay the sale of new products  reduce profits and adversely affect our reputation 
product liability claims not covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims involving claims of personal injury or property damage 
although we maintain product liability insurance coverage to protect us in the event of such a claim  our coverage may not be adequate to cover the cost of defense and the potential award 
also  a well publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect our reputation and reduce the demand for our products 
large contracts represent a significant portion of our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
we closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and have not  to date  experienced significant credit losses 
significant portions of our sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk  to some extent  by requiring deposits  payments prior to shipment  progress payments and letters of credit 
however  because some of the exposure is outside of our control  unanticipated events could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
the terms and conditions of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations  and we may not be able to raise additional capital  if needed 
the terms and conditions of our million revolving credit facility impose restrictions that limit  among other things  our ability to incur debt  merge  sell assets  make distributions and create or incur liens 
the availability of the credit facility is also subject to certain covenants as explained earlier in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure that we will achieve operating results meeting the requirements of the credit facility 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facility 
in the event of a default  the bank could elect to declare any outstanding principal amount of the credit facility and term debt  any and all accrued interest thereon and any and all other amounts payable under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
as of april   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants of its credit facility 
our ability to satisfy any debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
it is anticipated that borrowings from the existing credit facility and cash provided by operating activities should provide sufficient funds to finance capital expenditures  working capital and otherwise meet operating expenses and debt service requirements as they become due 
however  if additional capital is required  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our business is partially subject to risks of terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war 
terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war may disrupt our operations as well as the operations of our customers 
such acts have created an interruption of orders and delays in orders already booked primarily in sports facilities and destination sites 
any future terrorist activities and  to a lesser degree  acts of war  could create additional uncertainties forcing customers to further reduce or delay their spending or cancel or delay already planned projects  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our common stock has at times been thinly traded  which may result in low liquidity and price volatility 
the daily trading volume of our common stock has at times been relatively low 
if this were to occur in the future  the liquidity and appreciation of our common stock may not meet shareholders expectations  and the prices at which it trades may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted as a result of sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or by the perception that such sales could occur 
we may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and other key employees  including technical engineering talent  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees  including engineering talent in product design 
the loss of certain members of our senior management  including our chairman or chief executive officer  could negatively impact our operating results and ability to execute our business strategy 
our future success will also depend in part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with the executive officers or other employees but we do maintain key person life insurance on the chairman of the board  the chief executive officer and the vice president sales 
provisions in our charter documents and under south dakota law might deter acquisition bids for us 
there are provisions in our charter and other provisions under south dakota law that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit the stockholders 
our articles of incorporation provide for a classified board consisting of three classes of directors 
a classified board generally makes it more difficult to replace directors and to acquire our company 
in addition  we are governed by the provisions of the current south dakota business corporation act sd act  which may deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their common stock  which in turn have a depressive effect on the market price of the common stock 
in general  shares of a corporation acquired in a control share acquisition  as defined in the sd act  have no rights unless voting rights are approved in a prescribed manner 
there are also provisions that prohibit a public south dakota corporation from engaging in a business combination  as defined in the sd act  with an interested shareholder  as defined in the sd act  for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our products and services 
we may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future  and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services have been or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
a failure to protect proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  even if we are successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or defending ourselves against a claim of infringement  any related dispute or litigation could be costly and time consuming 
we maintain inventory that is subject to obsolescence and write downs to the extent it is replaced through product enhancements or advances in technology 
as a result of our products being subject to continuous enhancements and design changes  inventory held by us is subject to the risk of obsolescence and excess levels that may not be saleable 
losses incurred as a result could have a material impact on our future profits 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect that implementation of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no  r as amended by the securities and exchange commission on april  supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than the first annual period beginning after june  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the ultimate impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and other factors 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current rules 
this requirement will reduce our net operating cash flows and increase our net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we are currently analyzing the impact of these provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates through april   most of our net sales were denominated in united states dollars  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has not been significant 
net sales originating outside the united states for fiscal year were approximately of total net sales  of which a portion was denominated in canadian dollars  euros  or great britain pounds 
it is expected that in fiscal  net sales to international markets may increase as a percentage of net sales and that a greater portion of this business will be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  operating results may become subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
we will continue to monitor and minimize our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  use financial hedging techniques  including foreign currency forward contracts and options  to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
however  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing economic conditions  changes in political climates  differing tax structures and other rules and regulations could adversely affect our financial results in the future 
interest rate risks our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and long term accounts receivable 
we maintain a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
as of april   our outstanding debt approximated million  substantially all of which was in fixed rate obligations 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an insignificant annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of april  for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affects our fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
in connection with the sale of certain display systems  we have entered into various types of financing orders with customers 
the aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element 
the majority of these financings carry fixed rates of interest 
as of april   our outstanding long term receivables were approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of less than million 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations 
weighted average variable interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
principal notional amount by expected maturity in thousands fiscal year ending there after assets long term receivables  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate liabilities long and short term debt fixed rate long term marketing obligations  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet for long term receivables and long and short term debt approximate their fair values 
substantially all of our cash balances are denominated in united states dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies are operating balances maintained in accounts of our foreign subsidiaries 
these balances are immaterial to us as a whole
