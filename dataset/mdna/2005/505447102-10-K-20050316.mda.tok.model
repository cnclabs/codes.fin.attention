this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to those discussed in risk factors set forth in item of this annual report

executive overview for the year ended december   we reported a loss of million  or per share  which included a million gain on the sale of our investment in lava trading  inc  an exchange membership impairment charge of million  a debt repurchase charge of million  a goodwill impairment charge of million and a preferred stock discount accretion charge of million 
excluding the lava sale and the exchange membership impairment  debt repurchase  goodwill impairment charges and preferred stock discount accretion  our net income available to common stockholders for the full year was million  or per diluted share 
the key drivers that contributed to the decreased revenues at our nyse equity specialist subsidiary for included declining principal share volume and dollar value traded  lower market volatility and an increasing rate of program trading as a percentage of total trading volume on the nyse 
the decline in market volatility and rise in program trading resulted in fewer market imbalances  which lowered our rate of capital participation 
although this caused a decrease in principal trading revenues at our labranche co 
llc subsidiary in versus  our lsp and lsps subsidiaries principal trading revenues grew through expansion into new marketplaces and diversification of its specialist and market making product offerings 
throughout  we continued to improve operational efficiencies by reducing headcount and related operating expenses and further enhancing our compliance and trading systems 
we believe these changes have streamlined our organization without sacrificing our ability to respond to developments in the marketplace 
if implemented  we anticipate that the nyse s proposed changes to its automated trade execution system and the sec s proposed market structure changes will provide more challenges 
we are confident that our organization will successfully adapt to meet its future needs 
during  we successfully completed a refinancing of certain of our indebtedness by repurchasing a substantial portion of our then outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes and issuing million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the original notes and senior notes due the original notes and collectively with the original notes  the original senior notes 
although this refinancing increased the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness  the interest rates on the original senior notes and the third quarter repurchase of all remaining shares of our outstanding series b preferred stock with a portion of the proceeds of the original senior notes issuance have enabled us to extend the maturities of our debt without increasing our overall combined after tax annual interest and dividends expense 
on march   we entered into an agreement with the nyse and the sec to settle their investigations concerning our nyse specialist trading activity 
this settlement resolved the nyse and the sec investigations of our nyse specialist trading activity for all periods through as part of the settlement with the nyse and the sec  we have agreed to comply with the following undertakings implementation of systems and procedures to ensure appropriate follow up and review with regard to information provided to labranche co

new accounting developments in december  the fasb issued fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no

fin r was effective no later than the end of the first reporting period that ended after march  as of december   we have determined that none of our investments are considered a vie under the guidance provided in fin r  and therefore  the implementation of fin r has had no impact on our consolidated financial statements

critical accounting estimates goodwill and other intangible assets we determine the fair value of each of our reporting units and the fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in determining fair value  we use standard analytical approaches to business enterprise valuation bev  such as the market comparable approach and the income approach 
the market comparable approach is based on comparisons of the subject company to similar companies engaged in an actual merger or acquisition or to public companies whose stocks are actively traded 
as part of this process  multiples of value relative to financial variables  such as earnings or stockholders equity  are developed and applied to the appropriate financial variables of the subject company to indicate its value 
the income approach involves estimating the present value of the subject company s future cash flows by using projections of the cash flows that the business is expected to generate  and discounting these cash flows at a given rate of return 
each of these bev methodologies requires the use of management estimates and assumptions 
for example  under the market comparable approach  we assigned a certain control premium to the public market price of our common stock as of the valuation date of our third quarter impairment test  as well as our year end impairment test  in estimating the fair value of our specialist reporting unit 
similarly  under the income approach  we assumed certain growth rates for our revenues  expenses  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  returns on working capital  returns on other assets and capital expenditures  among others 
we also assumed certain discount rates and certain terminal growth rates in our calculations 
for our third quarter and year end goodwill impairment tests  we engaged an independent business valuation firm to assist us in our bev analyses 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of fair value of our goodwill 
we review the reasonableness of the carrying value of our goodwill on an annual calendar basis ie  december unless an event or change in circumstances would require an interim reassessment of impairment 
during the nine months ended september   certain changes in circumstances occurred  which management believed necessitated goodwill impairment testing 
the two primary factors we analyzed  which indicated a need for us to reassess the reasonableness of the carrying value of our goodwill at september   were the prolonged downward trend in our principal trading revenues at our specialist reporting unit and the continued decline in the public trading price of our common stock through september  in our third quarter sfas no 
test  we compared the fair value of our specialist reporting unit and the fair value of our specialist reporting unit s goodwill based on the methods described above to their respective carrying values in two separate steps under sfas no 
guidelines to arrive at the million impairment charge we recognized during the third quarter 
notwithstanding our interim valuation of goodwill as of september   sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill on an annual calendar basis 
accordingly  we updated our valuation models through and including our annual testing date  or december   and noted no further impairment of our goodwill 
we cannot provide assurance that future goodwill impairment testing will not result in impairment charges in subsequent periods 
our other intangible asset  as defined under sfas no 
 is our trade name 
we determine the fair value of our trade name by applying the income approach using the royalty savings methodology 
this method assumes that the trade name has value to the extent we are relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from it 
application of this methodology requires estimating an appropriate royalty rate  which is typically expressed as a percentage of revenue 
estimating an appropriate royalty rate includes reviewing evidence from comparable licensing agreements and considering qualitative factors affecting the trade name 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of fair value of our trade name 
we review the reasonableness of the carrying amount of our trade name on an annual basis in conjunction with our goodwill impairment assessment 
as of september   the fair value of our trade name determined in accordance with the methodology described above exceeded its carrying amount 
during our fiscal fourth quarter  no events or changes in circumstances occurred that required us to reassess the fair value of our trade name 
therefore  no impairment of our trade name exists at december  we cannot provide assurance that future trade name impairment testing will not result in impairment charges in subsequent periods 
non marketable securities the use of fair value to measure certain non marketable investments is a critical accounting estimate 
investments in non marketable securities consist of investments in equity securities of private companies  limited liability company interests and limited partnership interests  which do not have readily available price quotations 
certain investments in non marketable securities are initially carried at cost  as an approximation of fair value 
adjustments to carrying value are made if there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value 
for certain other investments in non marketable securities  we adjust their carrying value by applying the equity method of accounting  and for our investment in a limited partnership interest  we adjust its carrying value by recognizing our share of the partnership s quarterly results of operations 
in addition  if and when available  management considers other relevant factors relating to non marketable investments in estimating their fair value  such as the financial performance of the entity  its cash flow forecasts  trends within that entity s industry and any specific rights associated with our investment such as conversion features among others 
given management s judgment involved in valuing certain of our non marketable securities  it is possible  as of a given point in time  that a third party could reach a different conclusion of fair value utilizing the same variables as we have in our analysis 
other than temporary impairment of exchange memberships the determination of the fair value of our exchange memberships is a critical accounting estimate 
exchange memberships owned by us are originally carried at cost  pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide brokers and dealers in securities 
adjustments to carrying value are made if we deem that an other than temporary decline in value  as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  and in section m of topic of the sec staff accounting bulletin series sab no 
 has occurred 
in determining whether the value of our owned exchange memberships is impaired ie  fair market value is below cost and whether such impairment is temporary or other than temporary  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  information regarding recent sale and lease prices of exchange memberships  historical trends of sale and lease prices of memberships on a particular exchange and their duration  the current condition of the particular exchange s market structure  legal and regulatory developments affecting the particular exchange s market structure and earnings capability  trends in new listings on the particular exchange  general global and national economic factors and our knowledge and judgment of the specialist and execution and clearing industries and the securities market as a whole 
as a result of our analysis of the above mentioned factors for the three and six month periods ended december   the difference between the fair value of our nyse exchange memberships and their carrying value at december  is deemed temporary 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value or cost basis of our nyse fiscal and amex fiscal exchange memberships 
we cannot provide assurance that the consistent application of this accounting policy to future reporting periods will not result in further adjustments to the carrying value of our exchange memberships 
off balance sheet arrangements lfsi  through the normal course of business  enters into various securities transactions as agent 
the execution  settlement and financing of these transactions can result in off balance sheet risk and concentration of credit risk 
lfsi s execution and clearing activities involve settlement and financing of various customer securities transactions on a cash or margin basis 
these activities may expose lfsi to off balance sheet risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations and lfsi has to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  lfsi may be exposed to significant off balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur in their accounts

while these metrics are monitored by management each period  they are not the sole indicators or factors in any given period that determine our level of revenues  profitability or overall performance 
other factors  such as extreme price movements  unanticipated company news and events and other uncertainties may influence our financial performance either positively or negatively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the decline in net gain on principal transactions is attributable primarily to our labranche co 
llc subsidiary  where specialist trading revenue decreased to million for from million for the decrease was due to a decline in principal shares traded as well as a significant decline in market volatility  as measured by the average closing price of the vix 
another factor that has reduced the opportunity for the specialist to participate is the continuing rise in program trading as a percentage of nyse average daily share volume 
program trading involves reducing large share orders into many smaller orders  resulting in the orders being matched electronically 
these factors offset the benefit from the increases in nyse average daily share volume  and share volume and dollar value traded for stocks in which labranche co

net gain on principal transactions generated by our lsp and lsps subsidiaries increased to million in from million in this revenue growth was the result of an increase in the number of products traded  market maker professionals and exchanges in which lsp trades

for the year ended december   we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist us with these fair value tests 
since the carrying value of each reporting unit exceeded its fair value  we then compared the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value

llc agreed in principle with the nyse and the staff of the sec  subject to final approval by the sec  to settle the nyse and sec specialist trading investigations 
pursuant to the agreement in principle  an accrual was made for the settlement as of december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million in assets  of which million consisted of cash and short term investments  primarily in government obligations maturing within three months  cash and securities segregated under federal regulations and overnight repurchase agreements 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily with retained earnings from operations and proceeds from our debt and equity offerings 
due to the nature of the securities business and our role as a specialist  market maker and execution agent  the amount of our cash and short term investments  as well as operating cash flow  may vary considerably due to a number of factors  including the dollar value of our positions as principal  whether we are net buyers or sellers of securities  the dollar volume of executions by our customers and clearing house requirements  among others 
certain regulatory requirements constrain the use of a portion of our liquid assets for financing  investing or operating activities 
similarly  the nature of our business lines  the capital necessary to maintain current operations and our current funding needs subject our cash and cash equivalents to different requirements and uses 
as of december   the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations  without taking into account any available roll over provisions  were as follows total year years years years s omitted short term and long term debt subordinated liabilities deferred compensation operating lease obligations total amounts represent aggregate amount to be paid at maturity and do not include discounts of approximately million as of december  the above table includes indebtedness with primarily long term maturities  whose interest and principal payments have a significant effect on the cash available to finance our current and future operations 
as of december   our most significant long term indebtedness was the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  which mature in may  and the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  which mature in may the outstanding senior notes were issued pursuant to a new indenture that is similar to the indentures that governed the old notes prior to their amendment in connection with our may debt refinancing 
the new indenture includes certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to make certain investments  engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates  create liens on our assets and sell assets or engage in mergers and consolidations  except in accordance with certain specified conditions 
in addition  our ability to incur additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness  pay dividends  redeem stock or repurchase subordinated indebtedness prior to maturity will be limited if our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is at or below a threshold of on and after december  the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio reflects a comparison between our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  or ebitda  and the sum of our consolidated interest expense and a tax effected multiple of any dividend payments that we might make with respect to preferred stock 
as of december   our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was approximately the indenture governing the senior notes provides for certain exceptions to the limitations on restricted payments  including  for example  the july repurchase of all then outstanding shares of our series b preferred stock  repurchase of our senior notes  and any restricted payments up to an aggregate of million over the life of the indenture 
in addition  under the indenture governing the senior notes  if  at any time  our cumulative restricted payments since may  generally are greater than i the sum of a of our cumulative consolidated net income since july  or  if such calculation is a loss  minus of such loss and b of the net cash proceeds received from any issuance or sale of our capital stock since july   plus ii million  we will not be entitled to make a restricted payment at such time 
while we have not made any restricted payments since may   we cannot be sure if  when or to what extent this covenant will prevent us from making restricted payments in the future 
as of december   since our cumulative consolidated net income since july  was negative  we were not entitled to make any restricted payments in excess of the million basket described above 
the indenture governing the senior notes permits us to redeem some or all of the senior notes on or after may  and some or all of the senior notes on or after may  at varying redemption prices  depending on the date of redemption 
in addition  we have the option to redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes at a redemption price of and up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes at a redemption price of using the proceeds of certain equity offerings which we may complete on or prior to may  under the terms of the indenture  if we sell substantially all our assets or experience specific kinds of changes in control  we will be required to offer to repurchase senior notes  on a pro rata basis  at a price in cash equal to of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
after giving effect to our may debt refinancing and the repurchase of all then outstanding shares of our series b preferred stock in july  the after tax earnings per share impact of our ongoing interest obligations with respect to the senior notes is lower than the combined after tax earnings per share impact of our interest obligations with respect to the old notes and our non tax deductible dividend obligations with respect to our then outstanding series b preferred stock 
to the extent we repurchase any senior notes in connection with future corporate strategic initiatives  our fixed term interest payments would be correspondingly reduced 
the remaining million aggregate principal amount of notes that we did not repurchase in connection with our may debt refinancing will continue to accrue interest at a rate of per annum until they mature on march  to the extent we are not prohibited under the terms of the indenture governing the senior notes  we may seek to repurchase some or all of the remaining notes from time to time on the open market 
for  our reported revenues include a million realized gain from the sale of our investment in lava 
in connection with the sale  we received cash of approximately million at the closing 
additional consideration of approximately million is being held in escrow to secure our indemnification obligations as a stockholder of lava under the merger agreement and may be released in whole or in part months after the acquisition is consummated  subject to the final determination of any then outstanding indemnification claims and any claims regarding taxes 
under the terms of the indenture governing the senior notes  to the extent we do not use the net after tax proceeds of the lava transaction to repurchase certain of our secured indebtedness  repay the indebtedness of our subsidiaries or purchase replacement assets  we will be required  on the st day following the closing of the lava transaction  to offer to purchase senior notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to such net after tax proceeds at a price equal to of the principal amount of such senior notes 
a potential source of liquidity for labranche co 
llc is the committed line of credit that it maintains with a bank

in connection with the credit agreement  we pay a quarterly fee of of the total committed line of credit 
amounts outstanding under this credit facility would be secured by our inventory of specialist stocks and bear interest at the bank s broker loan rate 
this facility can only be used to finance inventory requirements at labranche co 
llc 
in order to maintain the availability of funds under this credit facility  we must comply with certain financial and other covenants 
as a specialist and market maker  we are required to maintain certain levels of capital and liquid assets as promulgated by various regulatory agencies  which regulate our business 
as part of our overall risk management procedures for further discussion  refer to part i  item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we attempt to balance our responsibility as specialist  market maker and broker dealer with our overall capital resources 
these requirements restrict our ability to make use of cash and other liquid assets for corporate actions  such as repaying our debt  repurchasing stock or making acquisitions 
as a broker dealer  labranche co 
llc is subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers and requiring the maintenance of minimum levels of net capital  as defined in sec rule c labranche co 
llc is required to maintain minimum net capital  as defined  equivalent to the greater of  or 
of aggregate indebtedness  as defined 
nyse rule c also prohibits a broker dealer from repaying subordinated borrowings  paying cash dividends  making loans to any parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which would result in a reduction of its total net capital to less than of its required minimum capital 
moreover  broker dealers are required to notify the sec prior to repaying subordinated borrowings  paying dividends and making loans to any parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which  if executed  would result in a reduction of or more of their excess net capital net capital less minimum requirement 
the sec has the ability to prohibit or restrict such transactions if the result is deemed detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker dealer

llc s and lsps required combined dollar amount of net liquid assets  as defined  was million 
labranche co 
llc s actual net liquid assets  as defined  was million as of december  lsps is not required to perform a net liquid assets calculation because labranche co 
llc s actual net liquid assets exceed the combined net liquid assets requirement of labranche co 
llc and lsps 
the nyse is currently reviewing its net liquid asset requirements with an announced view toward reducing the required amounts for specialists such as labranche co 
llc 
the timing and extent of any such reduction  however  has not been finally determined 
a reduction in labranche co 
llc s net liquid assets requirement would allow funds no longer needed for net liquid assets purposes to be used for other corporate purposes

as evidenced by the foregoing requirements  our broker dealer subsidiaries require a substantial amount of capital 
in particular  labranche co 
llc s and lsps combined net liquid asset requirement of million limits our ability to utilize a substantial portion of our liquid assets for other corporate purposes

upon the occurrence of a change of control  labranche co 
llc may  but is not required to  make one irrevocable separate offer to each holder of the senior subordinated notes to prepay all of the senior subordinated notes then held by that holder 
the occurrence of a change of control also constitutes an event of acceleration under the senior subordinated notes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because our equity specialist activities on the nyse and amex expose our capital to significant risks  managing these risks is a constant priority for us 
our central role in the auction process helps us to manage risks by incorporating up to date market information in the management of our inventory  subject to our specialist obligations 
we have developed a risk management process that is designed to balance our ability to profit from our specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses

our post managers meet with their respective floor captains on a weekly basis to review and  if necessary  revise the risk management procedures and trading guidelines for labranche co 
llc and or for particular specialist stocks 
in addition  post managers are always available on the trading floor to review and assist with any unusual trading situations reported by any floor captain

circuit breaker rules 
the nyse and amex have instituted certain circuit breaker rules intended to halt trading in all nyse amex listed stocks in the event of a severe market decline 
the circuit breaker rules impose temporary halts in trading when the dow jones industrial average drops a certain number of points 
current circuit breaker levels are set quarterly at  and percent of the dow jones industrial average closing values of the previous month  rounded to the nearest points 
these rules provide investors extra time to respond to severe market declines and provide us an additional opportunity to assure compliance with our risk management procedures

the percentage of labranche co 
llc s equity specialist trading revenue generated from its twenty five most profitable specialist stocks has decreased from to of total principal trading revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
labranche co 
llc is not overly reliant on a particular group of specialist stocks  as the composition of its ten and twenty five most profitable specialist stocks changes frequently 
our equity specialist trading activities are subject to a number of risks  including risks of price fluctuations  rapid changes in the liquidity of markets and foreign exchange risk related to american depositary receipts adrs 
in any period  we may incur trading losses in our specialist stocks for a variety of reasons  including price fluctuations of our specialist stocks and carrying out our specialist obligations 
from time to time  we may have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry 
in general  because our inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis  any significant price movement in these securities could result in a reduction of our revenues and operating profits 
derivatives market risk as a specialist in options  etfs and futures  lsp has a responsibility to maintain a fair and orderly market  and trades securities as principal out of both obligation and inclination

lsps etf trading exposes it to certain risks  including price fluctuations  foreign currency movements and changes in the liquidity of markets 
certain members of lsp s and lsps management are responsible for managing these risks 
these individuals utilize a third party software application to monitor lsp s and lsps positions on a real time basis 
by monitoring actual and theoretical profit and loss  volatility and other standard risk measures  these individuals seek to insure that all lsp and lsps traders operate within the parameters set by management 
lsp s and lsps traders purchase and sell futures  options  the stocks underlying certain positions  us government securities and foreign currencies in an attempt to hedge market and foreign currency risk 
lsp s and lsps aggregate risk is under constant evaluation by certain members of management and its traders  and all significant trading strategies and positions are closely monitored 
lsp s and lsps options  futures and etf trading is executed on national and foreign exchanges 
these trades clear through the options clearing corporation  the national securities clearing corporation or the applicable exchange clearing organization  thereby reducing potential credit risk 
the following chart illustrates how specified movements in the underlying securities prices of lsp s and lsps entire portfolios would have impacted profits and losses from their trading activities profit or loss if the underlying securities move s omitted portfolio as of march  june  september  december  the information in the above table is based on certain theoretical assumptions  and thus does not fully represent the profit or loss exposure to changes in volatility  interest rates and dividends 
the zero percent change column represents the profit or loss lsp and lsps would experience on a daily basis if the relevant market remained unchanged 
foreign currency risk in connection with labranche co 
llc s trading of us registered shares of foreign issuers  it is exposed to varying degrees of foreign currency risk 
the pricing of these securities is based on the value of the ordinary securities as denominated in their local currencies

llc acts as the specialist 
lsp and lsps trade international etfs that are denominated and settled in us dollars  but the pricing of these etfs is also affected by changes in the relevant foreign currency rates 
lsp and lsps hold various foreign currencies in order to lessen the risks posed by changing foreign currency rates 
in addition  lsp trades derivatives denominated in foreign currencies  which creates exposure to foreign currency risk for lsp 
the following chart illustrates how the specified movements in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar to which lsp  lsps and labranche co 
llc are exposed would have impacted profits and losses from their trading activities profit or loss if the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar move s omitted portfolio as of march  june  september  december  the information in the above table is based on certain assumptions and it does not fully represent the profit and loss exposure to changes in security prices  volatility  interest rates and other related factors

lfsi s execution and clearing activities require that lfsi execute transactions in accordance with customer instructions and accurately record and process the resulting transactions 
any failure  delay or error in executing  recording and processing transactions  whether due to human error or failure of lfsi s information or communication systems  could cause substantial losses for brokers  customers and or lfsi and could subject lfsi to claims for losses 
clearing activities include settling each transaction with both the contra broker and the customer 
in connection with lfsi s institutional and direct access floor brokerage activities  a transaction is settled either when the customer pays for securities purchased and takes delivery  or delivers securities sold for payment 
settling transactions for retail customers and professional investors involves financing the transaction until the customer makes payment or  for margin accounts  advancing credit to the customer within regulatory and internal guidelines 
clearing direct access brokers transactions includes guaranteeing their transactions to the contra broker on the exchange floor 
these clearing activities may expose lfsi to off balance sheet risk in the event customers or brokers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations and it is necessary to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  lfsi may be exposed to off balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur in their accounts 
the amount of risk related to lfsi s execution and clearance activities is linked to the size of the transaction  market volatility and the creditworthiness of customers and brokers 
lfsi s largest transactions involve those for institutional and direct access floor brokerage customers 
lfsi systematically monitors its open transaction risk starting when the transaction occurs and continuing until the designated settlement date 
transactions that remain unsettled after settlement date are scrutinized and necessary action to reduce lfsi s risk is taken 
credit risk that could result from contra brokers defaulting is minimized since much of the settlement risk for transactions with brokers is essentially transferred to the national stock clearing corporation 
the credit risk associated with institutional and direct access clearing customers is minimized since these customers have been qualified by the depository trust company dtc or the dtc participants or have met the prime broker qualification standards at other brokerage firms 
before conducting business with a prospective customer  lfsi s senior management  in conjunction with its compliance department  reviews the prospective customer s experience in the securities industry  financial condition and personal background  including a background check with a risk reporting agency 
for retail customers and professional investors  lfsi seeks to control the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines
