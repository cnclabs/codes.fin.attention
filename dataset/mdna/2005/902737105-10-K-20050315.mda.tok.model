item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
ceded reinsurance our insurance subsidiaries reinsure portions of the coverages provided by their insurance products with other insurance companies on both an excess of loss and coinsurance basis 
the maximum retention by us on one individual in the case of life insurance is  for mega and mid west and  for chesapeake 
we use reinsurance for our health insurance business solely for limited purposes 
reinsurance agreements are intended to limit an insurer s maximum loss 
competition in each of our lines of business  we compete with other insurance companies or service providers  depending on the line and product  although we have no single competitor who competes against us in all of the business lines in which we operate 
with respect to the business of our self employed agency division  the market is characterized by many competitors  and our main competitors include health insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and the blue cross blue shield plans in the states in which we write business 
with respect to our student insurance and star hrg businesses  we compete with subsidiaries and units of larger  national insurance providers 
while we are among the largest competitors in terms of market share in many of our business lines  in some cases there are one or more major market players in a particular line of business 
competition in our businesses is based on many factors  including quality of service  product features  price  scope of distribution  scale  financial strength ratings and name recognition 
we compete  and will continue to compete  for customers and distributors with many insurance companies and other financial services companies 
we compete not only for business and individual customers  employer and other group customers  but also for agents and distribution relationships 
some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products than our specific subsidiaries with which they compete in particular markets  may have a greater diversity of distribution resources  may have better brand recognition  may from time to time have more competitive pricing  may have lower cost structures or  with respect to insurers  may have higher financial strength or claims paying ratings 
organizations with sizable market share or provider owned plans may be able to obtain favorable financial arrangements from health care providers that are not available to us 
some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete 
in addition  from time to time  companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate  thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants 
for example  several large insurance companies have recently entered the market for individual health insurance products 
we may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices  or for other reasons  which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
regulatory and legislative matters insurance regulation state regulation our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in their states of domicile and the other states in which they do business under statutes that typically delegate broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers to insurance departments 
the method of regulation varies  but the subject matter of such regulation covers  among other things  the amount of dividends and other distributions that can be paid by the insurance subsidiaries without prior approval or notification  the granting and revoking of licenses to transact business  trade practices  including with respect to the protection of consumers  disclosure requirements  privacy standards  minimum loss ratios  premium rate regulation  underwriting standards  approval of policy forms  claims payment  licensing of insurance agents and the regulation of their conduct  the amount and type of investments that the insurance subsidiaries may hold  minimum reserve and surplus requirements  risk based capital requirements  and compelled participation in  and assessments in connection with  risk sharing pools and guaranty funds 
such regulation is intended to protect policyholders rather than investors 
our insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual statements with the state insurance regulatory departments and are subject to periodic financial and market conduct examinations by such departments 
the most recently completed financial examination for mega in oklahoma mega s domicile state was completed as of and for the three year period ended december  mega is currently undergoing a financial examination in oklahoma as of and for the two year period ended december  the most recently completed financial examination for mid west in tennessee mid west s domicile state was completed as of and for the five year period ended december  mid west is currently undergoing a financial examination in tennessee as of and for the four year period ended december  the most recently completed financial examination for chesapeake in oklahoma chesapeake s domicile state was completed as of and for the three year period ended december  the oklahoma department of insurance is currently conducting a financial examination of chesapeake as of  and for the three year period  ended december  state insurance departments have also periodically conducted and continue to conduct market conduct examinations of uici s insurance subsidiaries 
as of december   either or both of mega and mid west were subject to ongoing market conduct examinations and or open inquiries with respect to marketing practices in states 
state insurance regulatory agencies have authority to levy monetary fines and penalties resulting from findings made during the course of such market conduct examinations 
historically  our insurance subsidiaries have from time to time been subject to such fines and penalties  none of which individually or in the aggregate have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
on march   the office of the insurance commissioner of the state of washington issued a cease and desist order that prohibits mega from selling a previously approved health insurance product to consumers in the state of washington 
since october  representatives of mega have been engaged in discussions with the washington department of insurance in an effort to resolve issues with respect to use of a policy form that was initially approved by the washington department of insurance in uici has also voluntarily terminated sales of a similar product issued by mid west  pending resolution of the open issues with the state of washington department of insurance 
mega and mid west have issued certificates covering approximately  insureds in the state of washington 
uici currently does not believe that the issuance of the cease and desist order by the washington insurance commissioner will have a material adverse effect upon its results of operations or its financial condition 
state regulation of health insurance products varies from state to state  although all states regulate premium rates  policy forms and underwriting and claims practices to one degree or another 
most states have special rules for health insurance sold to individuals and small groups 
for example  a number of states have passed or are considering legislation that would limit the differentials in rates that insurers could charge for health care coverage between new business and renewal business for small groups with similar demographics 
every state has also adopted legislation that would make health insurance available to all small employer groups by requiring coverage of all employees and their dependents  by limiting the applicability of pre existing conditions exclusions  by requiring insurers to offer a basic plan exempt from certain benefits as well as a standard plan  or by establishing a mechanism to spread the risk of high risk employees to all small group insurers 
the us congress and various state legislators have from time to time proposed changes to the health care system that could affect the relationship between health insurers and their customers  including external review 
in addition  various states are considering the adoption of play or pay laws requiring that employers either offer health insurance or pay a tax to cover the costs of public health care insurance 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect that any proposals  if adopted  or legislative developments could have on our insurance businesses and operations 
a number of states have enacted new health insurance legislation over the past several years 
these laws  among other things  mandate benefits with respect to certain diseases or medical procedures  require health insurers to offer an independent external review of certain coverage decisions and establish health insurer liability 
there has also been an increase in legislation regarding  among other things  prompt payment of claims  privacy of personal health information  health insurer liability  prohibition against insurers including discretionary clauses in their policy forms and relationships between health insurers and providers 
we expect that this trend of increased legislation will continue 
these laws may have the effect of increasing our costs and expenses 
we provide health insurance products to consumers in the self employed market in states 
as is the case with many of our competitors in this market  a substantial portion of our products are issued to members of various independent membership associations that act as the master policyholder for such products 
during  we and our insurance company subsidiaries resolved a nationwide class action lawsuit challenging the nature of the relationship between our insurance companies and the membership associations that make available to their members our insurance companies health insurance products 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
while we believe that we are providing association group coverage in full compliance with applicable law  changes in our relationship with the membership associations and or changes in the laws and regulations governing association group insurance particularly changes that would subject the issuance of policies to prior premium rate approval and or require the issuance of policies on a guaranteed issue basis could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and or business 
many states have also enacted insurance holding company laws that require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies controlled by other corporations 
such laws vary from state to state  but typically require periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the controlled insurer and prior notice to  or approval by  the applicable regulator of inter corporate transfers of assets and other transactions including payments of dividends in excess of specified amounts by the controlled insurer within the holding company system 
such laws often also require the prior approval for the acquisition of a significant ownership interest ie  or more in the insurance holding company 
uici the holding company and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to such laws  and we believe that we and such subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable insurance holding company laws and regulations 
under the risk based capital initiatives adopted in by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  insurance companies must calculate and report information under a risk based capital formula 
risk based capital formulas are intended to evaluate risks associated with asset quality  adverse insurance experience  losses from asset and liability mismatching  and general business hazards 
this information is intended to permit regulators to identify and require remedial action for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  but it is not designed to rank adequately capitalized companies 
at december   the risk based capital ratio of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries significantly exceeded the ratio for which regulatory corrective action would be required 
the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed have the authority to change the minimum mandated statutory loss ratios to which they are subject  the manner in which these ratios are computed and the manner in which compliance with these ratios is measured and enforced 
loss ratios are commonly defined as incurred claims divided by earned premiums 
most states in which our insurance subsidiaries write insurance have adopted the loss ratios recommended by the naic  but frequently the loss ratio regulations do not apply to the types of health insurance issued by our subsidiaries 
we are unable to predict the impact of i any changes in the mandatory statutory loss ratios for individual or group policies to which we may become subject  or ii any change in the manner in which these minimums are computed or enforced in the future 
such changes could result in a narrowing of profit margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have not been informed by any state that our insurance subsidiaries do not meet mandated minimum ratios  and we believe that we are in compliance with all such minimum ratios 
in the event that we are not in compliance with minimum statutory loss ratios mandated by regulatory authorities with respect to certain policies  we may be required to reduce or refund premiums  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 
the naic and state insurance departments are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations  including those related to reducing the risk of insolvency and related accreditation standards 
to date  the increase in solvency related oversight has not had a significant impact on our insurance business 
federal regulation in  the us congress enacted the mccarran ferguson act  which declared the regulation of insurance to be primarily the responsibility of the individual states 
although repeal of mccarran ferguson is debated in the us congress from time to time  the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business 
however  federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas  including healthcare  pension regulation  age and sex discrimination  financial services regulation  securities regulation  privacy laws  terrorism and federal taxation  do affect the insurance business 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa as with other lines of insurance  the regulation of health insurance historically has been within the domain of the states 
however  hipaa and the implementing regulations promulgated thereunder by the department of health and human services impose new obligations for issuers of health and dental insurance coverage and health and dental benefit plan sponsors 
hipaa requires certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of health insurance coverage for individuals and small employer groups generally or fewer employees and limits exclusions based on pre existing conditions 
most of the insurance reform provisions of hipaa became effective for plan years beginning on or after july  hipaa also establishes new requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information and new standards for electronic health care transactions 
the department of health and human services promulgated final hipaa regulations in the privacy regulations required compliance by april  the electronic transactions regulations by october and the security regulations by april as have other entities in the health care industry  we have incurred substantial costs in meeting the requirements of these hipaa regulations and expect to continue to incur costs to achieve and to maintain compliance 
we have been working diligently to comply with these regulations within the time periods required and believe that we will comply in a timely fashion 
as a consequence of these new standards for electronic transactions  we may see an increase in the number of health care transactions that are submitted to us in paper format  which could increase our costs to process medical claims 
hipaa is a far reaching and complex issue and proper interpretation and practice under the law continue to evolve 
consequently  our efforts to measure  monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with hipaa are ongoing 
failure to comply could result in regulatory fines and civil lawsuits 
knowing and intentional violations of these rules may also result in federal criminal penalties 
uici is currently reviewing the potential impact of the hipaa privacy and security regulations on its operations  including its information technology and security systems 
the company cannot at this time predict with specificity what impact the recently adopted final hipaa rules governing the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information may have on the business or results of operations of the company 
however  these new rules will likely increase the company s burden of regulatory compliance with respect to its life and health insurance products and other information based products  and may reduce the amount of information the company may disclose and use if the company s customers do not consent to such disclosure and use 
there can be no assurance that the restrictions and duties imposed by the recently adopted final rules on the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information will not have a material adverse effect on uici s business and future results of operations 
usa patriot act on october   the international money laundering abatement and anti terrorist financing act of was enacted into law as part of the usa patriot act 
the law requires  among other things  that financial institutions adopt anti money laundering programs that include policies  procedures and controls to detect and prevent money laundering  designate a compliance officer to oversee the program and provide for employee training  and periodic audits in accordance with regulations proposed by the us treasury department 
proposed treasury regulations governing portions of our life insurance business would require us to develop and implement procedures designed to detect and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing 
we remain subject to us regulations that prohibit business dealings with entities identified as threats to national security 
we have licensed software to enable us to detect and prevent such activities in compliance with existing regulations and we are developing policies and procedures designed to comply with the proposed regulations should they come into effect 
there are significant criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violation of treasury regulations 
we believe that the steps we are taking to comply with the current regulations and to prepare for compliance with the proposed regulations should be sufficient to minimize the risks of such penalties 
can spam act from time to time the company utilizes  either directly or through third party vendors  e mail to identify prospective sales leads for use by its agents 
the federal can spam act  which became effective january  and is administered and enforced by the federal trade commission  establishes national standards for sending bulk  unsolicited commercial e mail 
while targeting and prohibiting e marketers to send unsolicited commercial email with falsified headers  the can spam act permits the use of unsolicited commercial e mail if and as long as the message contains an opt out mechanism  a functioning return e mail address  a valid subject line indicating the e mail is an advertisement and the legitimate physical address of the mailer 
while the company has taken what it believes are reasonable steps to ensure that it  and the various third party vendors with which it does business  are in full compliance with the can spam act  failure to comply with the provisions of the can spam act could result in regulatory fines and civil lawsuits 
gramm leach bliley act the financial services modernization act of the so called gramm leach bliley act  or glba includes several privacy provisions and introduced new controls over the transfer and use of individuals nonpublic personal data by financial institutions  including insurance companies  insurance agents and brokers and certain other entities licensed by state insurance regulatory authorities 
glba provides that there is no federal preemption of a state s insurance related privacy laws if the state law is more stringent than the privacy rules imposed under glba 
accordingly  selected state insurance regulators or state legislatures have adopted rules that limit the ability of insurance companies  insurance agents and brokers and certain other entities licensed by state insurance regulatory authorities to disclose and use non public information about consumers to third parties 
these limitations require the disclosure by these entities of their privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  will allow consumers to prevent the disclosure or use of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party 
pursuant to the authority granted under glba to state insurance regulatory authorities to regulate the privacy of nonpublic personal information provided to consumers and customers of insurance companies  insurance agents and brokers and certain other entities licensed by state insurance regulatory authorities  the national association of insurance commissioners has recently promulgated a new model regulation called privacy of consumer financial and health information regulation 
some states issued this model regulation before july   while other states must pass certain legislative reforms to implement new state privacy rules pursuant to glba 
in addition  glba requires state insurance regulators to establish standards for administrative  technical and physical safeguards pertaining to customer records and information to a ensure their security and confidentiality  b protect against anticipated threats and hazards to their security and integrity  and c protect against unauthorized access to and use of these records and information 
the privacy and security provisions of glba will significantly affect how a consumer s nonpublic personal information is transmitted through and used by diversified financial services companies and conveyed to and used by outside vendors and other unaffiliated third parties 
legislative developments legislation has been introduced in the us congress that would allow state chartered and regulated insurance companies  such as our insurance subsidiaries  to choose instead to be regulated exclusively by a federal insurance regulator 
we do not believe that such legislation will be enacted during the current congressional term 
numerous proposals to reform the current health care system have been introduced in the us congress and in various state legislatures 
proposals have included  among other things  modifications to the existing employer based insurance system  a quasi regulated system of managed competition among health insurers  and a single payer  public program 
changes in health care policy could significantly affect our business 
for example  federally mandated  comprehensive major medical insurance  if proposed and implemented  could partially or fully replace some of our current products 
furthermore  legislation has been introduced from time to time in the us congress that could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in regulating insurance companies 
there is also legislation pending in the us congress and in various states designed to provide additional privacy protections to consumer customers of financial institutions 
these statutes and similar legislation and regulations in the united states or other jurisdictions could affect our ability to market our products or otherwise limit the nature or scope of our insurance operations 
the naic and individual states have been studying small face amount life insurance for the past three years 
some initiatives that have been raised at the naic include further disclosure for small face amount policies and restrictions on premium to benefit ratios 
the naic is also studying other issues such as suitability of insurance products for certain customers 
this may have an effect on our pre funded funeral insurance business 
suitability requirements such as a customer assets and needs worksheet could extend and complicate the sale of pre funded funeral insurance products 
we are unable to evaluate new legislation that may be proposed and when or whether any such legislation will be enacted and implemented 
however  many of the proposals  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows or results of operations  while others  if adopted  could potentially benefit our business 
recently  the insurance industry has experienced substantial volatility as a result of current litigation  investigations and regulatory activity by various insurance  governmental and enforcement authorities concerning certain practices within the insurance industry 
these practices include the payment of contingent commissions by insurance companies to insurance brokers and agents and the extent to which such compensation has been disclosed  the solicitation and provision of fictitious or inflated quotes  the use of inducements to brokers or companies in the sale of group insurance products  and the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or other non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products 
we have received inquiries and informational requests from insurance departments in certain states in which our insurance subsidiaries operate 
we cannot predict at this time the effect that current litigation  investigations and regulatory activity will have on the insurance industry or our business 
the naic and several states have recently proposed regulations and or laws that would that would prohibit agent broker practices that have been the focus of recent investigations of broker compensation in the state of new york 
the naic has adopted a compensation disclosure amendment to its producers licensing model act which  if adopted by the states  would require disclosure by agents brokers to customers that insurers will compensate such agents brokers for the placement of insurance and documented acknowledgement of this arrangement in cases where the customer also compensates the agent broker 
some larger states  including california and new york  are considering additional provisions that would require the disclosure of the amount of compensation and or require where an agent broker represents more than one insurer placement of the best coverage 
we cannot predict how many states  if any  may promulgate the naic amendment or similar regulations or the extent to which these regulations may have an adverse impact on our business

overview we offer insurance primarily health and life to niche consumer and institutional markets 
through our subsidiaries we issue primarily health insurance policies  covering individuals and families  to the self employed  association group  voluntary employer group and student markets  and life insurance policies to markets that we believe are underserved 
we believe that we have the largest direct selling organization in the health insurance field  with approximately  independent writing agents selling health insurance to the self employed market in states 
the company s revenues consist primarily of premiums derived from sales of its indemnity  ppo  student group and voluntary employer group health plans and from life insurance policies 
revenues also include investment income derived from our investment portfolio and other income  which consists primarily of income derived by the self employed agency division from ancillary services and membership marketing and administrative services provided to the membership associations that make available to their members the company s health insurance products 
premiums on health insurance contracts are recognized as earned over the period of coverage on a pro rata basis 
premiums on traditional life insurance are recognized as revenue when due

claims expenses consist primarily of payments to physicians  hospitals and other health care providers under health policies and include an estimated amount for incurred but not reported or paid claims 
underwriting  policy acquisition costs and insurance expenses consist of direct expenses incurred across all insurance lines in connection with issuance  maintenance and administration of in force insurance policies  including amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  commissions paid to agents  administrative expenses and premium taxes 
the company also incurs other direct expenses in connection with generating income derived by the self employed agency division from ancillary services and membership marketing and administrative services provided to the membership associations that make available to their members the company s health insurance products 
the company establishes liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported under health and life insurance contracts 
these claim liabilities are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider a number of items  including historical and current claim payment patterns  product variations  the timely implementation of appropriate rate increases and seasonality 
see discussion below  critical accounting policies and estimates claim liabilities and note f of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with various stock based compensation plans that we maintain for the benefit of our employees and independent agents  we record non cash variable stock based compensation expense in amounts that depend and fluctuate based upon the market performance of the company s common stock 
see discussion below under the caption variable stock based compensation and note m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accounting treatment of the company s agent plans has resulted and will continue to result in unpredictable stock based compensation charges  primarily dependent upon future fluctuations in the quoted price of uici common stock 
our business segments for financial reporting purposes include a the insurance segment  which includes the businesses of the company s self employed agency division  the student insurance division  the star hrg division  the life insurance division and other insurance consisting of the company s zon re  usa llc accident insurance reinsurance business  which commenced operations in the third quarter of  and b other key factors  which includes investment income not allocated to the insurance segment  realized gains or losses on sale of investments  interest expense on corporate debt  general expenses relating to corporate operations  minority interest  variable stock based compensation and operations that do not constitute reportable operating segments including the company s investment in healthaxis  inc until sold on september  
for segment reporting  the company had previously reported the student insurance division and star hrg division as one business unit referred to as group insurance division 
effective october   the company began reporting the results of the group insurance division as two business units  the student insurance division and star hrg division 
over the past two years we have actively endeavored to simplify our business by closing and or disposing of assets and operations not otherwise related to our core health and life insurance operations 
we have separately classified as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes the operations of our former academic management services corp 
ams subsidiary engaged in the student loan origination and funding business  student loan servicing business  and tuition installment payment plan business  which we sold in november   our senior market division through which we formerly developed and marketed long term care and medicare supplement insurance products for the senior market and our special risk division through which we formerly provided various niche health insurance related products  including stop loss  marine crew accident  organ transplant and international travel accident products and various insurance intermediary services and managed care services 
recent developments on march   the office of the insurance commissioner of the state of washington issued a cease and desist order that prohibits mega from selling a previously approved health insurance product to consumers in the state of washington 
since october  representatives of mega have been engaged in discussions with the washington department of insurance in an effort to resolve issues with respect to use of a policy form that was initially approved by the washington department of insurance in uici has also voluntarily terminated sales of a similar product issued by mid west  pending resolution of the open issues with the state of washington department of insurance 
mega and mid west have issued certificates covering approximately  insureds in the state of washington 
uici currently does not believe that the issuance of the cease and desist order by the washington insurance commissioner will have a material adverse effect upon its results of operations or its financial condition 
results of operations overview during the company s financial condition  cash flow and results from operations were impacted by several key factors and developments favorable results at sea division the company s results from continuing operations benefited from the strong performance of its sea division  which reported record operating income in of million  compared to operating income of million in results at the company s sea division in reflected a favorable loss ratio and increased renewal premium revenue  with which is associated a lower commission rate compared to the commission rate on first year premium revenue 
reduction in sea claim liability results in at the company s sea division benefited from a significant decrease in loss ratio from in to in associated with the sea division s block of health insurance business 
this decrease in the loss ratio was due in significant part to the reduction in the amount of million during of claim liabilities established in in response to a rapid pay down in of an excess pending claims inventory

change in claims and future benefit liability estimates self employed agency division effective january   the company s sea division made certain refinements to its claim and future benefit liability estimates  the net effect of which decreased claim and future policy benefit liabilities and correspondingly increased operating income reported by the sea division in the amount of million in the first quarter of set forth below is a summary of the adjustments and changes in accounting estimates made by the company 
rop liability the company has issued certain health policies with a return of premium rop rider  pursuant to which the company undertakes to return to the policyholder on or after age all premiums paid less claims reimbursed under the policy 
the rop rider also provides that the policyholder may receive a portion of the benefit prior to age prior to january   the company established a liability for future rop benefits  which liability was calculated by applying mid terminal reserve factors calculated on two year preliminary term basis  using interest  cso mortality terminations  and level future gross premiums to the current premium on a contract by contract basis 
a claim offset was applied  on a contract by contract basis  solely with respect to an older closed block of policies  utilizing only claims paid to date  with no assumption of future claims 
the company records an rop liability to fund longer term obligations associated with the rop rider 
this liability is impacted both by the techniques utilized to calculate the liability and the many assumptions underlying the calculation  including interest rates  policy lapse rates  premium rate increases on policies and assumptions with regard to claims paid 
the company had previously utilized a simplified estimation technique described above that it believed generated an appropriate rop liability in the aggregate 
however  the company reviewed its rop estimation technique in order to determine if refinements to the technique were appropriate 
as a result of such review  and as more particularly described in the paragraph below  effective january   the rop estimation technique was refined to utilize new mid terminal reserve factors calculated on a net level basis  using interest  cso mortality and assuming annual increases in future gross premiums and to apply these factors to the historical premium payments on a contract by contract basis 
the net premium assumption was revised from two year preliminary term to net level in order to produce a more appropriate accrual for the liability of the rop benefits in relation to the premiums 
the interest rate assumption was reduced from to to reflect current investment yields 
since the rop rider is primarily attached to attained age rated health insurance products that are subject to periodic rate adjustment  the company has determined as part of its ongoing review of the rop estimation technique to increase its rop liability to cover reasonably foreseeable changes to the future gross premium 
based on company experience  the revised reserve factors incorporate an assumption of a average annual increase in future gross premiums on such products 
the estimation technique was also refined to use historical premiums and anticipated future premium increases in the calculation of future benefits rather than calculating the liability only from the current gross premium 
finally  a claim offset for actual benefits paid through the reporting date is applied to the rop liability for all policies on a contract by contract basis 
in the original simplified estimation technique  the intent was to balance the offsetting effects of applying the two year preliminary term factors to the current gross premiums  since the historical premium information was not available 
changes to the technique were made in when sufficient historical premium information was available to refine the estimation calculation 
substantially all of the effect of this change in estimating the liability for future rop benefits was attributable to the refinement of adding the assumption of a average annual increase in the level of future gross premiums for attained age rated health insurance products 
as a result of these changes  the liability for future rop benefits increased  and operating income correspondingly decreased  by million during the first quarter of assumptions used in the estimation of the company s rop liability  such as interest or the annual increases in future gross premiums  will continue to be used in subsequent accounting periods for those benefits already issued  including the future gross premiums anticipated by the reserve factors 
changes in assumptions may be applied to newly issued policies as well as for adjustments in the level of premium for existing policies other than those already anticipated 
the new assumptions used will be those appropriate at the time the change is made 
the rop liabilities in the amount of million and million at december  and  respectively  are reflected in future policy and contract benefits on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
claims liability changes the sea division utilizes the developmental method to estimate claims liabilities 
under the developmental method  completion factors are applied to claim payments in order to estimate the ultimate claim payments 
these completion factors are derived from historical experience and are dependent on the incurred dates of the claim payments 
prior to january   the company utilized the original incurred date coding definition to establish the date a policy claim is incurred under the developmental method 
under the original incurred date coding definition  prior to the end of the period in which a health policy claim was made  the company estimated and recorded a liability for the cost of all medical services related to the accident or sickness relating to the claim  even though the medical services associated with such accident or sickness might not be rendered to the insured until a later financial reporting period 
due to the anticipation of a future increase in the level of favorable development associated with the growth in business  the sea division undertook an analysis of the liability estimation process 
the company believes that the developmental method is the standard methodology within the health insurance industry and therefore re evaluated the key assumptions utilized under this method 
as the company gained more experience with the older blocks of business  the original incurred date coding assumption was re examined 
this re examination resulted in the decision to utilize a new incurred date definition instead of the original incurred date definition for purposes of estimating claim liabilities for the sea division 
effective january   the company implemented a new incurred date coding definition to establish incurred dates under the developmental method in the sea division 
under this new incurred date coding definition  a break in service of more than six months will result in the establishment of a new incurred date for subsequent services 
in addition  under this new incurred date coding definition  claim payments continuing more than thirty six months without a six month break in service will result in the establishment of a new incurred date 
this change in the incurred date definition assumption resulted in a reduction in the estimated claim liabilities at the sea division  and a corresponding increase in operating income  in the amount of million during the first quarter of other changes in estimate several refinements in the claims liability calculation  all of which were treated as changes in accounting estimates  resulted in a further reduction of the claims liability  and corresponding increase in operating income  in the amount of million during the first quarter of this reduction in the claims liability was attributable primarily to the effects of a change in estimate of the liability for excess pending claims 
this change was necessary to maintain consistency with the historical data underlying the calculation of the new completion factors used in the claim development calculation 
these completion factors are based on more recent experience with claims payments than the previous factors 
this more recent experience has a greater number of pending claims 
as a result  the new completion factors have built in a higher level of liabilities for pending claims 
the release of a portion of the excess pending claims liability reflects the additional pending claims included in the completion factors

liquidity and capital resources consolidated on a consolidated level  the company s primary sources of liquidity have been premium revenues from policies issued  investment income  fees and other income  proceeds from corporate borrowings and borrowings to fund student loans 
the primary uses of cash have been payments for benefits  claims and commissions under those policies  operating expenses  cash dividends to shareholders  stock repurchases and the funding of student loans 
during  the company generated net cash from operations on a consolidated basis in the amount of million  compared to million in and million in the company s consolidated short and long term indebtedness all of which constituted indebtedness of the holding company exclusive of indebtedness secured by student loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  at each of december  and  the company had an aggregate of million of indebtedness outstanding under a secured student loan credit facility  which indebtedness is represented by student loan asset backed notes the spe notes issued by a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity the spe 
at december  and  indebtedness outstanding under the secured student loan credit facility was secured by alternative ie  non federally guaranteed student loans and accrued interest in the carrying amount of million and million  respectively  and by a pledge of cash  cash equivalents and other qualified investments in the amount of million and million  respectively 
at december   million of such cash  cash equivalents and other qualified investments was available to fund the purchase from the company of additional student loans generated under the company s college first alternative loan program  which purchases may be made in accordance with the terms of the agreements governing the securitization until february all indebtedness issued under the secured student loan credit facility is reflected as student loan indebtedness on the company s consolidated balance sheet  all such student loans and accrued investment income pledged to secure such facility are reflected as student loan assets and accrued investment income  respectively  on the company s consolidated balance sheet  and all such cash  cash equivalents and qualified investments specifically pledged under the student loan credit facility are reflected as restricted cash on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the spe notes represent obligations solely of the spe and not of the company or any other subsidiary of the company 
for financial reporting and accounting purposes the student loan credit facility has been classified as a financing 
accordingly  in connection with the financing the company has recorded and will in the future record no gain on sale of the assets transferred to the spe 
the spe notes were issued by the spe in three tranches million of series a notes and million of series a notes issued on april   and million of series a notes issued on april  
the series a notes and series a notes have a final stated maturity of july   the series a notes have a final stated maturity of july  however  the spe notes are subject to mandatory redemption in whole or in part a on the first interest payment date which is at least days after february   from any monies then remaining on deposit in the acquisition fund not used to purchase additional student loans and b on the first interest payment date which is at least days after july   from any monies then remaining on deposit in the acquisition fund received as a recovery of the principal amount of any student loan securing payment of the spe notes  including scheduled  delinquent and advance payments  payouts or prepayments 
after july   the spe notes are also subject to mandatory redemption in whole or in part on each interest payment date from any monies received as a recovery of the principal amount of any student loan securing payment of the spe notes  including scheduled  delinquent and advance payments  payouts or prepayments 
the spe and the secured student loan facility were structured with an expectation that interest and recoveries of principal to be received with respect to the underlying student loans securing payment of the spe notes would be sufficient to pay principal of and interest on the spe notes when due  together with operating expenses of the spe 
this expectation was based upon analysis of cash flow projections  and assumptions regarding the timing of the financing of the underlying student loans to be held by the spe  the future composition of and yield on the financed student loan portfolio  the rate of return on monies to be invested by the spe in various funds and accounts established under the indenture governing the spe notes  and the occurrence of future events and conditions 
there can be no assurance  however  that the student loans will be financed as anticipated  that interest and principal payments from the financed student loans will be received as anticipated  that the reinvestment rates assumed on the amounts in various funds and accounts will be realized  or other payments will be received in the amounts and at the times anticipated

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to health and life insurance claims  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
claims liabilities the company establishes liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported under health and life insurance contracts 
consistent with overall company philosophy  a single best estimate claim liability is determined which is expected to be adequate under most circumstances 
this estimate is developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider a number of items as appropriate  including but not limited to historical and current claim payment patterns  product variations  the timely implementation of appropriate rate increases and seasonality 
the company does not develop ranges in the setting of the claims liability reported in the financial statements 
however  to the extent not already reflected in the actuarial analyses  management also considers qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate benefit levels to determine its best estimate of the claims liability 
these qualitative considerations include  among others  the impact of medical inflation  utilization of health services  exposure levels  product mix  pending claim levels and other relevant factors 
the company uses the developmental method to estimate claim liabilities 
this method applies completion factors to claim payments in order to estimate the ultimate amount of the claim 
these completion factors are derived from historical experience and are dependent on the incurred dates of the claim payments 
an extensive degree of judgment is used in this estimation process 
for health care costs payable  the claim liability balances and the related benefit expenses are highly sensitive to changes in the assumptions used in the claims liability calculations 
with respect to health claims  the items that have the greatest impact on the company s financial results are the medical cost trend  which is the rate of increase in health care costs  and the unpredictable variability in actual experience 
any adjustments to prior period claim liabilities are included in the benefit expense of the period in which adjustments are identified 
due to the considerable variability of health care costs and actual experience  adjustments to health claim liabilities usually occur each quarter and are sometimes significant 
the company believes that its recorded claim liabilities are reasonable and adequate to satisfy its ultimate claims liability 
each of the company s major operating units has an actuarial staff that has primary responsibility for assessing the claim liabilities 
corporate has an oversight process in place to provide final review of the establishment of the claim liabilities 
the company uses its own experience as appropriate and relies on industry loss experience as necessary in areas where the company s data is limited 
our estimate of claim liabilities represents management s best estimate of the company s liability as of december  assuming a hypothetical difference in the loss ratio ie  benefits  claims and settlement expenses stated as a percentage of earned premiums for the year ended december   net income would increase or decrease by approximately million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by approximately per share 
prior to january   the sea division utilized the original incurred date coding definition to establish the date a policy claim is incurred under the developmental method 
under the original incurred date coding definition  prior to the end of the period in which a health policy claim was made  the company estimated and recorded a liability for the cost of all medical services related to the accident or sickness relating to the claim  even though the medical services associated with such accident or sickness might not be rendered to the insured until a later financial reporting period 
due to the anticipation of a future increase in the level of favorable development associated with the growth in business  the sea division undertook an analysis of the liability estimation process 
the company believes that the developmental method is the standard methodology within the health insurance industry and therefore re evaluated the key assumptions utilized under this method 
with the aging of the older blocks of business  the original incurred date coding assumption was re examined 
this re examination resulted in the decision to utilize a new incurred date definition instead of the original incurred date definition for purposes of estimating claim liabilities for the sea division 
effective january   the company implemented a new incurred date coding definition to establish incurred dates under the developmental method in the sea division 
under this new incurred date coding definition  a break in service of more than six months will result in the establishment of a new incurred date for subsequent services 
in addition  under this new incurred date coding definition  claim payments continuing more than thirty six months without a six month break in service will result in the establishment of a new incurred date 
this change in the incurred date definition assumption resulted in a reduction in the estimated claim liabilities  and a corresponding increase in operating income  at the sea division in the amount of million during the first quarter of the sea division also makes various refinements to the claim liabilities as appropriate 
these refinements estimate liabilities for circumstances  such as an excess pending claims inventory ie  inventories of pending claims in excess of historical levels and disputed claims 
for example  the company closely monitors the level of claims that are pending 
when the level of pending claims appears to be in excess of normal levels  the company typically establishes a liability for excess pending claims 
the company believes that such an excess pending claims liability is appropriate under such circumstances because of the operation of the developmental method used by the company to calculate the principal claim liability  which method develops or completes paid claims to estimate the claim liability 
when the pending claims inventory is higher than would ordinarily be expected  the level of paid claims is correspondingly lower than would ordinarily be expected 
this lower level of paid claims  in turn  results in the developmental method yielding a smaller claim liability than would have been yielded with a normal level of paid claims  resulting in the need for an augmented claim liability 
with respect to business at its student insurance and star hrg divisions  the company assigns incurred dates based on the date of service 
this definition estimates the liability for all medical services received by the insured prior to the end of the applicable financial period 
appropriate adjustments are made in the completion factors to account for pending claim inventory changes and contractual continuation of coverage beyond the end of the financial period 
set forth below is a summary of claim liabilities by business unit at each of december   and at december  in thousands self employed agency division student insurance division star hrg division life insurance division other insurance subtotal reinsurance recoverable total claim liability activity in the claims liability is summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands claims liability at beginning of year  net of related reinsurance recoverables add claims liability on acquired business incurred losses  net of reinsurance  occurring during current year prior years deduct payments for claims  net of reinsurance  occurring during current year prior years claims liability at end of year  net of related reinsurance recoverables claims liability development experience inherent in the company s claim liability estimation practices is the desire to establish liabilities that are more likely to be redundant than deficient 
furthermore  the company s philosophy is to price its insurance products to make an underwriting profit  not to increase written premiums 
while management continually attempts to improve its loss estimation process by refining its ability to analyze loss development patterns  claim payments and other information  uncertainty remains regarding the potential for adverse development of estimated ultimate liabilities 
set forth in the table below is a summary of the claims liability development experience favorable unfavorable by business unit in the company s insurance segment for each of the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands self employed agency division student insurance division star hrg division life insurance division other insurance total favorable sea division the above table shows incurred losses developed at the sea division in amounts less than originally anticipated due to better than expected experience on the health business in the sea division in   and the favorable claims liability development experience at the sea division in reflects the effect of million in claim liabilities established during in response to a rapid pay down during of an excess pending claims inventory 
in particular  during the company observed a change in the distribution of paid claims by incurred date  more paid claims were assigned to recent incurred dates than had been the case on paid claims in prior years 
assignment of paid claims with more recent incurred dates typically results in an understatement of the claim development liability  resulting in the need for augmented claim liabilities 
the company believes that the deviation from historical experience in incurred date assignment was a natural consequence of the effort required to reduce a claims backlog  which the company was experiencing at the sea division during the course of however  as the actual claims experience developed in  these augmented claim liabilities in the amount of million proved to be redundant 
these claim liabilities were released during and  as a result  will not influence the level of claim liability redundancies in future periods 
the total favorable claims liability development experience for in the amount of million represented of total claim liabilities established for the sea division at december  excluding the impact of the augmented claim liabilities established at december  in response to the rapid pay down during of an excess pending claims inventory  the favorable experience in in the claims liability was million  or of total claim liabilities established for the sea division at december  the total favorable claims liability development experience for in the amount of million represented of total claim liabilities established for the sea division at december  the favorable experience in the sea division for included the effect of the million decrease in claims liability due to the refinements made effective january  to the claims liability calculation million and changes in estimate million 
see the discussion above under the caption change in claims and future benefit liability estimates self employed agency division 
excluding the impact of these refinements and changes in estimate  the favorable experience in in the claims liability was million  or of the total claim liabilities established for the sea division at december  the total favorable claims liability development experience for in the amount of million represented of total claim liabilities established for the sea division at december  over time  the developmental method replaces anticipated experience with actual experience  resulting in an ongoing re estimation of the claims liability 
since the greatest degree of estimation is used for more recent periods  the most recent prior year is subject to the greatest change 
recent actual experience has produced lower levels of claims payment experience than originally expected 
student insurance division and star hrg division the products of the student insurance and star hrg divisions consist principally of medical insurance 
in general  medical insurance business  for which incurred dates are assigned based on date of service  has a short tail  which means that a favorable development or unfavorable development shown for prior years relates primarily to actual experience in the most recent prior year 
the unfavorable claims liability development experience at the student insurance division in in the amount of million reflects the effects of a delay in processing of prior year claims and higher than expected claim experience associated with the business written for the school year 
the student insurance division experienced favorable claims liability development for and the favorable claims liability development experience at the star hrg division in includes the effects of claims in developing more favorably than indicated by the loss trends in used to determine the claim liability at december  the star hrg division also experienced favorable development for since the star hrg business was new to the company acquired in  an expected loss ratio was used to set the claims liability at december  life insurance division the adverse experience for the life insurance division during and was attributable to development of its closed block of workers compensation business 
the life insurance division previously wrote workers compensation insurance and similar group accident coverage for employers in a limited geographical market 
in may  the company made the decision to terminate this operation  and all existing policies were terminated as the policies came up for renewal over the succeeding twelve months 
the closing of new and renewal business starting in july of had the effect of concentrating the claims experience into existing policies and eliminating any benefits that might accrue from improved underwriting of new business or liabilities released on newer claims that might settle more quickly 
the effect of closing a block of this type of business is difficult to estimate at the date of closing  due to the longer claims tail usually experienced with workers compensation coverage  the tendency of claims to concentrate in severity but without an associated degree of predictability as the number of cases decreases  and the unpredictable costs of protracted litigation often associated with the adjudication of claims under workers compensation policies 
accounting for policy acquisition costs health policy acquisition costs the company incurs various costs in connection with the origination and initial issuance of its health insurance policies  including underwriting and policy issuance costs  costs associated with lead generation activities and distribution costs ie  sales commissions paid to agents 
the company defers those costs that vary with production 
the company defers commissions paid to agents and premium taxes with respect to the portion of health premium collected but not yet earned  and the company amortizes the deferred expense over the period as and when the premium is earned 
costs associated with generating sales leads with respect to the health business issued through the sea division are capitalized and amortized over a two year period  which approximates the average life of a policy 
for financial reporting purposes  underwriting and policy issuance costs which the company estimates are more fixed than variable with respect to health policies issued through the company s sea  student insurance and star hrg divisions are expensed as incurred 
with respect to health policies sold through the company s sea division  commissions paid to agents with respect to first year policies are higher than commissions paid to agents with respect to policies in renewal years 
accordingly  during periods of increasing first year premium revenue such as occurred during  the sea division s overall operating profit margin will be negatively impacted by the higher commission expense associated with first year premium revenue 
life policy acquisition costs the company incurs various costs in connection with the origination and initial issuance of its life insurance policies  including underwriting and policy issuance costs 
the company defers those costs that vary with production 
the company capitalizes commission and issue costs primarily associated with the new business of its life insurance division 
deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new life insurance sales 
policy acquisition costs associated with traditional life business are capitalized and amortized over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of the annual premium revenue to the total premium revenue anticipated 
such anticipated premium revenue  which is modified to reflect actual lapse experience  is estimated using the same assumptions as are used for computing policy benefits 
for universal life type and annuity contracts  capitalized costs are amortized at a constant rate based on the present value of the estimated gross profits expected to be realized on the book of contracts 
other the cost of business acquired through acquisition of subsidiaries or blocks of business is determined based upon estimates of the future profits inherent in the business acquired 
such costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated premium paying period 
anticipated investment income is considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists 
the amortization period is adjusted when estimates of current or future gross profits to be realized from a group of products are revised 
the company monitors and assesses the recoverability of deferred health and life policy acquisition costs on a quarterly basis 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
statement also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment 
prior to the adoption of statement  goodwill was amortized using the straight line method  generally to years 
the company has determined that it will review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment as of november of each year or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
an impairment loss would be recorded in the period such determination was made 
the company s annual review in of the goodwill and other intangible assets related to continuing operations indicated no impairment 
as a result of the transitional impairment testing completed during the quarter ended june   the company determined that goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of former subsidiaries  academic management services corp 
ams and barron risk management services barron was impaired in the aggregate amount of million million net of tax 
the company reflected this impairment charge in its financial statements as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  in accordance with statement no 
during and  the company sold ams and barron  respectively 
accounting for agent stock accumulation plans the company sponsors a series of stock accumulation plans the agent plans established for the benefit of the independent insurance agents and independent sales representatives associated with uga association field services  new united agency and cornerstone america 
the company has established a liability for future unvested benefits under the agent plans and adjusts the liability based on the market value of the company s common stock 
the accounting treatment of the company s agent plans has resulted and will continue to result in unpredictable stock based compensation charges  dependent upon fluctuations in the quoted price of uici common stock 
these unpredictable fluctuations in stock based compensation charges may result in material non cash fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
see discussion above under the caption variable stock based compensation and note m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
investments the company has classified its investments in securities with fixed maturities as available for sale 
investments in equity securities and securities with fixed maturities have been recorded at fair value  and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity 
investment income is recorded when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
investments are reviewed quarterly to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a loss is recognized at the date of determination 
testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgment 
the identification of potentially impaired investments  the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known  and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time 
the current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 
the same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets 
investments are reviewed quarterly or more frequently if certain indicators arise to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
management s review considers the following indicators of impairment fair value significantly below cost  decline in fair value attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting a particular investment  decline in fair value attributable to specific conditions  such as conditions in an industry or in a geographic area  decline in fair value for an extended period of time  downgrades by rating agencies from investment grade to non investment grade  financial condition of the issuer deterioration and situations where dividends have been reduced or eliminated or scheduled interest payments have not been made 
management monitors investments where two or more of the above indicators exist 
the company also identifies investments in economically challenged industries 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a loss is recognized at the date of determination 
the company seeks to match the maturities of invested assets with the payment of expected liabilities 
by doing this  the company attempts to make cash available as payments become due 
if a significant mismatch of the maturities of assets and liabilities were to occur  the impact on the company s results of operations could be significant 
deferred taxes the company records deferred tax assets to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets 
the company establishes a valuation allowance when management believes  based on the weight of the available evidence  that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
however  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
during  the company determined that it was more likely than not that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets  which related primarily to operating losses in prior years at the company s ams subsidiary 
accordingly  in  the company released and recognized as income the then remaining valuation allowance of million 
during  the company realized million of net capital losses for federal tax purposes 
the capital losses were generated in from the sale of ams  healthaxis and seniorsfirst llc and were partially offset by the gain from the sale of a substantial portion of the company s equity stake in amli residential 
to the extent not utilized to offset capital gains generated in prior years  the net capital losses generated in will be carried forward to future years  with the ability to utilize the remaining capital losses in through during  the company determined that it was more likely than not that it would not be able to realize its deferred tax assets related to a portion of the capital loss carryforwards generated in accordingly  the company established a valuation allowance of million associated with the carryforwards at december  as of december   the balance of the valuation allowance was million  reflecting a reduction of million from the valuation allowance at december  the reduction in the valuation allowance was attributable primarily to realization of tax capital gains during at this time management does not anticipate selling appreciated assets to generate capital gains and impair future investment return solely for the purpose of utilizing the capital loss carryover 
in addition  management believes it cannot rely on unrealized gains in its investment portfolio as evidence of recoverability of the deferred tax asset on the capital loss carryover 
however  the company will consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need to change the valuation allowance 
in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  the valuation allowance would be adjusted to reflect its deferred tax assets at the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized 
increasing the valuation allowance would result in a charge to income in the period such determination was made 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
loss contingencies the company is subject to proceedings and lawsuits related to insurance claims and other matters 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accruals required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
privacy initiatives the business of insurance is primarily regulated by the states and is also affected by a range of legislative developments at the state and federal levels 
recently adopted legislation and regulations governing the use and security of individuals nonpublic personal data by financial institutions  including insurance companies  may have a significant impact on the company s business and future results of operations 
see business regulatory and legislative matters 
other matters the state of domicile of each of the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries imposes minimum risk based capital requirements that were developed by the naic 
the formulas for determining the amount of risk based capital specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances and premium levels based on the perceived degree of risk 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined  to its authorized control level risk based capital  as defined 
companies specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specified corrective action 
at december   the risk based capital ratio of each of the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries significantly exceeded the ratios for which regulatory corrective action would be required 
dividends paid by domestic insurance companies out of earned surplus in any year are limited by the law of the state of domicile 
see item market for registrant s common stock and related stockholder matters and note j of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation historically has had a significant impact on the health insurance business 
in recent years  inflation in the costs of medical care covered by such insurance has exceeded the general rate of inflation 
under basic hospital medical insurance coverage  established ceilings for covered expenses limit the impact of inflation on the amount of claims paid 
under catastrophic hospital expense plans and preferred provider contracts  covered expenses are generally limited only by a maximum lifetime benefit and a maximum lifetime benefit per accident or sickness 
thus  inflation may have a significantly greater impact on the amount of claims paid under catastrophic hospital expense and preferred provider plans as compared to claims under basic hospital medical coverage 
as a result  trends in health care costs must be monitored and rates adjusted accordingly 
under the health insurance policies issued in the self employed market  the primary insurer generally has the right to increase rates upon days written notice and subject to regulatory approval in some cases 
the annuity and universal life type policies issued directly and assumed by the company are significantly impacted by inflation 
interest rates affect the amount of interest that existing policyholders expect to have credited to their policies 
however  the company believes that the annuity and universal life type policies are generally competitive with those offered by other insurance companies of similar size  and the investment portfolio is managed to minimize the effects of inflation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement r  share based payment  which requires all companies to recognize compensation cost for all share based payments to employees at fair value 
the statement is effective for public companies except small business issuers  as defined in sec regulation s b for interim or annual periods beginning after june  the fasb also concluded that retroactive application of the requirements of statement not statement r to the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the effective date would be permitted  but not required 
the company therefore will be required to apply statement r beginning july  and could choose to apply statement retroactively from january  to june  the cumulative effect of adoption  if any  would be measured and recognized on july  the company believes the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material effect upon the financial condition or results of operations

on march   the aicpa s accounting standards executive committee issued an exposure draft statement of position sop  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements other than those specifically described in fasb statement no 
the exposure draft provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements other than those specifically described in fasb statement no 
 including definition of an internal replacement  determining not substantially different internal replacements  accounting for internal replacements that are substantially different  accounting for internal replacements that are not substantially different  sales inducements offered in conjunction with an internal replacement  costs and assessments related to internal replacements  and recoverability 
a final sop would be effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
restatement of previously issued annual financial statements is not permitted 
initial application of this sop should be as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that is  if the sop is adopted prior to the effective date and during an interim period  all prior interim periods of the year of adoption should be restated 
the impact of implementation of the sop  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements other than those specifically described in fasb statement no 
on the company s financial position or results of operations is not expected to be material 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this report and other documents or oral presentations prepared or delivered by and on behalf of the company contain or may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the united states private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are statements based upon management s expectations at the time such statements are made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements 
when used in written documents or oral presentations  the terms anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  objective  plan  possible  potential  project  will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such statements  factors that could impact the company s business and financial prospects include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those discussed from time to time in the company s various filings with the securities and exchange commission or in other publicly disseminated written documents medical claims and health care costs if the company is unable to accurately estimate medical claims and control health care costs  its results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
the company estimates the costs of its future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods based upon historical data  medical inflation  product mix  seasonality  utilization of health care services and other relevant factors 
the company establishes premiums based on these methods 
the premiums the company charges its customers generally are fixed for one year periods  and therefore  costs the company incurs in excess of its medical claim projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums 
certain factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to vary from what the company estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include  but not be limited to an increase in the rates charged by providers of health care services and supplies  including pharmaceuticals  higher than expected use of health care services by members  the occurrence of bioterrorism  catastrophes or epidemics  changes in the demographics of insureds and medical trends affecting insureds  and new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase the company s costs 
the occurrence of any of these factors  which are beyond the company s control  could result in a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation the company conducts business in a heavily regulated industry  and changes in government regulation could increase the costs of compliance or cause the company to discontinue marketing its products in certain states 
the company s business is extensively regulated by federal and state authorities 
some of the new federal and state regulations promulgated under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  relating to health care reform require the company to implement changes in its programs and systems in order to maintain compliance 
the company has incurred significant expenditures as a result of hipaa regulations and expects to continue to incur expenditures as various regulations become effective 
the company is subject to periodic changes in state laws and regulations regarding the selection and pricing of risks and other matters 
new regulations regarding these issues could increase the company s costs and decrease its premiums 
the company has in the past decided  and may in the future decide  to discontinue marketing its products in states that have enacted  or are considering  various health care reform regulations that would impair the company s ability to market its products profitably 
federal and state legislatures also are considering health care reform measures which may result in higher health insurance costs 
the implementation of prompt pay laws  whereby a claim must be paid in a certain number of days regardless of whether it is a valid claim or not  subject to a right of recovery  may have a negative effect on the company s results of operations 
regulatory compliance the company s failure to comply with new or existing government regulation could subject it to significant fines and penalties 
the company s efforts to measure  monitor and adjust its business practices to comply with the law are ongoing 
failure to comply with enacted regulations  including the laws mentioned above  could require the company to pay refunds or result in significant fines  penalties  or the loss of one or more of its licenses 
from time to time the company is subject to inquiries related to its activities and practices in states in which it operates 
the company has been subject to regulatory penalties  assessments and restitution orders in a number of states 
furthermore  federal and state laws and regulations continue to evolve 
the costs of compliance may cause the company to change its operations significantly  or adversely impact the health care provider networks with which the company does business  which may adversely affect its business and results of operations 
association group health insurance and certain relationships as is the case with many of our competitors in the self employed market  a substantial portion of our health insurance products are issued to members of various independent membership associations that act as the master policyholder for such products 
the two principal membership associations in the self employed market that make available to their members our health insurance products are the national association for the self employed and the alliance for affordable services 
the associations provide their membership access to a number of benefits and products  including health insurance underwritten by us 
subject to applicable state law  individuals generally may not obtain insurance under an association s master policy unless they are also members of the association 
the agreements with these associations requiring the associations to continue as the master policyholder for our policies and to make our products available to their respective members are terminable by us and the associations upon not less than one year s advance notice to the other party 
our uga agents and cornerstone agents also act as field service representatives fsrs for the associations  in which capacity the fsrs enroll new association members and provide membership retention services 
for such services  we and the fsrs receive compensation 
specialized association services  inc a company controlled by the adult children of ronald l 
jensen  uici s chairman provides administrative and benefit procurement services to the associations 
one of our subsidiaries uici marketing  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary and our direct marketing group generates new membership sales prospect leads for both uga and cornerstone for use by the fsrs agents 
uici marketing also provides video and print services to the associations and to specialized association services  inc see note k of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to health insurance premiums derived from the sale of health insurance  we receive fee income from the associations  including fees associated with enrollment and member retention services  fees for association membership marketing and administrative services and fees for certain association member benefits 
during  we and our insurance company subsidiaries resolved a nationwide class action lawsuit challenging the nature of the relationship between our insurance companies and the membership associations that make available to their members our insurance companies health insurance products 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
while we believe that we are providing association group coverage in full compliance with applicable law  changes in our relationship with the membership associations and or changes in the laws and regulations governing so called association group insurance particularly changes that would subject the issuance of policies to prior premium rate approval and or require the issuance of policies on a guaranteed issue basis could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and or business 
litigation the company is subject to class actions and other forms of litigation in the ordinary course of its business  including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories  which could result in significant liabilities and costs 
for example  during we and our insurance company subsidiaries resolved a nationwide class action lawsuit challenging the nature of the relationship between our insurance companies and the membership associations that make available to their members our insurance companies health insurance products 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the nature of the company s business subjects it to a variety of legal actions and claims relating but not limited to a denial of health care benefits  b disputes over rating methodology and practices or termination of coverage  c disputes with agents over compensation or other matters  d disputes related to claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements  e disputes related to managed care or cost containment activities  and f disputes over co payment calculations 
the company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of lawsuits against the company or the potential costs associated with defending such suits 
recently  the insurance industry has experienced substantial volatility as a result of current litigation  investigations and regulatory activity by various insurance  governmental and enforcement authorities concerning certain practices within the insurance industry 
these practices include the payment of contingent commissions by insurance companies to insurance brokers and agents and the extent to which such compensation has been disclosed  the solicitation and provision of fictitious or inflated quotes  the use of inducements to brokers or companies in the sale of group insurance products  and the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or other non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products 
we have received inquiries and informational requests from insurance departments in certain states in which our insurance subsidiaries operate 
we cannot predict at this time the effect that current litigation  investigations and regulatory activity will have on the insurance industry or our business 
competition the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
competition in the company s industry may limit its ability to attract new insureds or to maintain its existing membership in force 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  benefit plan design  and quality of customer service  reputation and quality of agent relations 
the company competes for insureds with other health insurance providers and managed care companies  many of whom have many more insureds in regional markets and greater financial resources 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to compete effectively in this industry 
as a result  the company may be unable to attract new insureds or maintain its existing policies in force and its results of operations may be adversely affected 
information systems information processing is critical to the company s business  and a failure of the company s information system to provide timely and accurate information could adversely affect its business and results of operations 
the company s failure to maintain an effective and efficient information system or disruptions in its information system could cause disruptions in its business operations  including a failure to comply with prompt pay laws  b loss of existing insureds  c difficulty in attracting new insureds  e disputes with insureds  providers and agents  f regulatory problems  g increases in administrative expenses  and h other adverse consequences 
negative publicity negative publicity regarding the company s business practices and about the health insurance industry in general may harm the company s business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the nature of the market for the health and life insurance and related products and services we provide is that we interface with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual consumers 
there may be a perception among the media and or consumer advocate groups that these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection 
accordingly  from time to time  consumer advocate groups or the media may focus attention on our products and services  thereby subjecting uici and or its industry to the possibility of periodic negative publicity 
we may also be negatively impacted if another company in one of our businesses or in a related business engages in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses 
negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation  which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services  requiring us to change our products or services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate 
provider network relationships the company s results of operations and competitive position could be adversely affected by its inability to enter into or maintain satisfactory relationships with networks of hospitals  physicians  dentists  pharmacies and other health care providers 
the failure to secure cost effective health care provider network contracts may result in a loss of insureds or higher medical costs 
in addition  the inability to contract with provider networks  the inability to terminate contracts with existing provider networks and enter into arrangements with new provider networks to serve the same market  and or the inability of providers to provide adequate care  could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
insurance company ratings company s principal insurance subsidiaries are currently rated by am best company  fitch and standard poor s 
in evaluating a company  independent rating agencies review such factors as the company s capital adequacy  profitability  leverage and liquidity  book of business  quality and estimated market value of assets  adequacy of policy liabilities  experience and competency of management  and operating profile 
if the company s insurance subsidiaries are not able to maintain their current rating by am best company  fitch and or standard poor s  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected  particularly with respect to the company s star hrg and student insurance businesses 
decreases in operating performance and other financial measures may result in a downward adjustment of the rating of the insurance subsidiaries assigned by am best company  fitch or standard poor s 
in addition  other factors beyond the company s control such as general downward economic cycles and changes implemented by the rating agencies  including changes in the criteria for the underwriting or the capital adequacy model may result in a decrease in the rating 
a downward adjustment in rating by am best company  fitch and or standard poor s of the company s insurance subsidiaries could cause the company s agents or potential customers to look at the company with less favor  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
holding company structure uici is a holding company  the principal assets of which are its investments in its separate operating subsidiaries  including its regulated insurance subsidiaries 
the holding company s ability to fund its cash requirements is largely dependent upon its ability to access cash  by means of dividends or other means  from its subsidiaries 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit their ability to transfer funds to the company 
if the company is unable to obtain funds from its insurance subsidiaries  it will experience reduced cash flow  which could affect the company s ability to pay its obligations to creditors as they become due 
capital and surplus requirements if the company s regulated insurance subsidiaries are not able to comply with state capital standards  state regulators may require the company to take certain actions that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
state regulations govern the amount of capital required to be retained in the company s regulated insurance subsidiaries and the ability of those regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 
those state regulations include the requirement to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus  including meeting the requirements of the risk based capital standards promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners 
state regulators have broad authority to take certain actions in the event those capital requirements are not met 
those actions could significantly impact the way the company conducts its business  reduce its ability to access capital from the operations of its regulated insurance subsidiaries and have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
any new minimum capital requirements adopted in the future through state regulation may increase the company s capital requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the primary market risk to the company s investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments and the amount of interest that policyholders expect to have credited to their policies 
the interest rate risk taken in the investment portfolio is managed relative to the duration of the liabilities 
the company s investment portfolio consists mainly of high quality  liquid securities that provide current investment returns 
the company believes that the annuity and universal life type policies are generally competitive with those offered by other insurance companies of similar size 
the company does not anticipate significant changes in the primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in the future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods
