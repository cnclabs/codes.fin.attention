item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
executive overview we have two reportable segments us operations and international operations 
the us operations segment provides equity trading and research services to institutional investors  brokers and alternative investment funds and money managers in the us while our international operations segment includes our brokerage businesses in australia  canada  europe and hong kong  as well as a research facility in israel 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from the following three products and services product revenues posit electronic trading desk client site trading products revenues primarily consist of commissions from customers use of our trade execution and analytical and research services 
because these commissions are paid on a per transaction basis  revenues fluctuate from period to period depending on i the volume of securities traded through our services in the us and canada  and ii the contract value of securities traded in europe  australia and hong kong 
expenses consist of compensation and employee benefits  transaction processing  software royalties  occupancy and equipment  telecommunications and data processing services  restructuring charges  and other general and administrative expenses 
our us operations faced a difficult economic environment in  with continued execution pricing pressure and challenging equity market conditions 
the average portfolio turnover rate for equity funds  weighted by fund assets  dropped to as of october  which was the lowest in over years 
volatility as measured by the vix index cboe volatility index hit its lowest average levels since in this lackluster environment  program trading as a percentage of nyse traded volume continued to rise  averaging 
this increase in program trading further intensified the competition for execution only commissions  with the remainder of order flow allocated for fundamental research commitments to full service brokers or soft dollar obligations 
in this environment  itg s us domestic revenues declined 
our international operations fared better  achieving record revenues of million for  an increase of million over this revenue growth includes a benefit from foreign exchange rate movement of million 
according to london stock exchange lse statistics  the value of uk equity customer business grew for the year 
our european business grew at a slower pace with itg europe s market share of lse customer business for the year decreasing to from in however this decrease primarily reflected difficult trading conditions at the start of the year as the business adjusted to the challenges posed to posit following the introduction of the lse s setsmm trading service in november by the second half of these challenges had been largely addressed and uk market share had increased to in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
in addition  the value of continental european equities traded by itg europe also increased  up in  compared to these increases in market share and values traded were attributable to a range of factors including developing our portfolio trading services and winning new clients with tca 
for  revenues from our european business grew million  which included a foreign exchange rate benefit of million 
in canada  our second largest international business after europe  the volume of shares traded on the tsx increased to billion shares in from billion in  with itg canada increasing its market share to of value traded on the tsx from in for  revenues from our canadian business grew million  which included a foreign exchange rate benefit of million as well as a million gain on our sale of of ktg 
our results reflect the following non recurring items i 
unrealized gains of million  representing the carrying value of shares of common stock that we own in archipelago holdings inc archipelago  following its august initial public offering  are included in other revenues 
these shares were acquired via an equity entitlement program 
ii 
a recovery against previous investment write downs of million 
iii 
a million gain on our sale of of ktg in april iv 
an impairment charge of million on our new york stock exchange seats as a result of a decline in value that we determined to be other than temporary 
v 
our expenses also included other non recurring items related to a lease abandonment in california  and employee separation costs 
collectively  these costs were million 
the impact of the non recurring items was a million increase in pretax income and a million increase in after tax net income 
reported earnings per share for the year increased by as a result of these non recurring items 
for comparative purposes  our results also included certain non recurring items 
included in our results are i a resolution of an internal revenue service examination of research and development tax credits taken on itg s federal income tax returns prior to as a result of this settlement  we reversed approximately million of tax reserves into income  together with  of related interest expense that had been accrued as a pre tax item within other general and administrative expenses  and ii impairment charges of million recorded during relating to certain assets whose fair market value was lower than our cost basis which included a million write down of our new york stock exchange seats 
these non recurring items reduced pretax income by million and increased after tax income by million 
certain factors that may affect our results of operations while our management s long term expectations are optimistic  we face risks or uncertainties that may affect our results of operations 
the following conditions  among others  should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook 
financial market conditions and general economic and political conditions the demand for our securities brokerage and related services is directly affected by factors such as economic and political conditions that may lead to decreased trading activity and prices in the securities markets generally 
the future economic environment may be subject to periodic economic downturns  such as recessions  as well as geopolitical unrest  war and acts of terrorism in regions where we do business or otherwise  which could also result in reduced trading volumes and prices  which could materially harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
over the last year  the institutional equities market in the us has also experienced continued pricing pressure on commission revenues 
our business is materially affected by conditions in both domestic and foreign financial markets 
we anticipate a continuation of the weak pricing environment in the immediate future 
decreases in trading volumes or market prices declines in the volume of securities trading and in market liquidity generally result in lower revenues from our posit  client site trading products and electronic trading desk products 
in addition  our trading commissions outside the us and canada are based on the value of transactions rather than volume based  which would be adversely affected by price declines 
our profitability would be adversely affected by a decline in trading revenues because a significant portion of our costs are fixed 
for these reasons  decreases in trading volume or securities prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
regulation general the securities markets and the brokerage industry in which we operate are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world 
we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
in our case  the impact of regulation extends beyond traditional areas of securities regulation  such as disclosure and prohibitions on fraud and manipulation by market participants  to the regulation of the structure of markets 
the securities industry has been subject to several fundamental regulatory changes 
in the future  the industry may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations  which may adversely affect our business 
the markets for equity securities have been subject to the most significant regulatory changes 
we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes can affect our business 
on february   the sec published proposed regulation nms for public comment 
on december   the sec published a revised version of proposed regulation nms 
if adopted in its revised form  regulation nms would incorporate four substantive provisions related to the regulatory structure of the us equity markets 
subject to applicable exceptions  proposed rule of regulation nms would require trading centers which would include national securities exchanges  national securities associations that operate an sro trading facility  atss such as posit and triact  exchange market makers  broker dealers that execute orders internally by trading as principal  or broker dealers  such as itg inc  that execute orders internally by crossing orders as agent to establish  maintain  and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the execution of trades at prices inferior to protected quotations displayed by other trading centers 
to be protected  a quotation must be immediately and automatically accessible 
proposed rule would require fair and non discriminatory access to quotations  establish a limit on access fees  and require each national securities exchange and national securities association to adopt and enforce rules that prohibit their members from engaging in a pattern or practice of displaying quotations that lock or cross automated quotations 
proposed rule generally would prohibit market participants from accepting  ranking or displaying orders  quotations or indications of interest in pricing increments finer than one penny 
the proposed rule would not prohibit systems  such as posit  that match unpriced orders at the midpoint of the best bid and offer from executing such orders in share prices of less than one cent 
finally  regulation nms would amend the various national market system joint industry quotation and trade reporting plans to modify the formulas for allocating net income among the exchanges and national securities associations that are the participants of such plans 
itg cannot predict whether or when any or all of proposed regulation nms  either as currently proposed or as may be later modified by the sec  ultimately will be adopted by the sec 
as a result  we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes associated with regulation nms would affect our business 
regulation ats before regulation ats went into effect on april   we operated posit pursuant to a no action letter from the sec staff which stated that it would not commence an enforcement action if posit were operated without registering as an exchange 
we are currently operating posit and triact as part of our broker dealer operations in accordance with regulation ats 
accordingly  neither posit nor triact is registered with the sec as an exchange 
there can be no assurance that the sec will not in the future seek to impose more stringent regulatory requirements on the operation of alternative trading systems such as posit and triact 
there can be no assurance that congress will not enact additional legislation applicable to alternative trading systems 
similarly  the non us posit systems are subject to various regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate  changes to which can have a negative impact on each posit system s ability to operate 
net capital requirement each of our broker dealer subsidiaries is subject to regulatory capital requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate 
the failure by any of these subsidiaries to maintain its required regulatory capital may lead to suspension or revocation of its broker dealer registration and its suspension or expulsion by us or international regulatory bodies  and ultimately could require its liquidation 
we do not currently maintain any credit facilities in the event of a regulatory capital shortfall 
historically  all regulatory capital needs of itg inc  alternet and itg execution services have been provided by cash from operations 
while we believe that cash flows from operations will continue to provide itg inc  alternet and itg execution services with sufficient regulatory capital  we are considering the establishment of a credit facility to supplement our existing regulatory capital  as needed 
soft dollars in the us  the provision of research to investment managers in consideration of commissions is conducted in conjunction with the investment manager s reliance upon the safe harbor provided under section e of the securities exchange act of the safe harbor protections of section e apply equally to the provision of independent third party research  as well as proprietary research 
the sec from time to time has been urged by competitors of the company and others to seek congressional reconsideration of section e or alter its scope  including modifying the nature of section e from a safe harbor to a mandatory regime for the use of soft dollars applicable to all investment advisors including those not registered with the sec 
from time to time  other regulatory or governmental entities  as well as industry groups  have issued statements  reports and best practices regarding soft dollars 
any regulatory changes or industry best practices that narrow the definition of research provided in section e or limit the scope  or modify the nature  of the section e safe harbor  or impose onerous record keeping  reporting or other obligations regarding soft dollar and directed brokerage arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
competition the financial services industry generally  and the securities brokerage business in which we engage in particular  is extremely competitive  and we expect it to remain so 
the brokerage and related services offered by us compete with services provided by leading brokerage firms and transaction processing firms and with providers of electronic trading and trade order management systems and financial information services 
posit also competes with various national and regional securities exchanges and execution facilities  the nasdaq national market  atss and ecns for trade execution services 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources which  among other things  enable them to compete with the services we provide on the basis of price  and a willingness to commit their firms capital to service a client s trading needs on a principal  rather than on an agency  basis 
many of them offer a wider range of services  have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do 
outside the united states  in addition to our us competitors with international capabilities  we compete with non us financial service companies that may also have long standing  well established relations with their clients  some of which also hold dominant positions in their trading markets 
we compete on the basis of a number of factors  including access to liquidity  transaction execution  our products and services  innovation  reputation and price 
insufficient system capacity or system failures our business relies heavily on the computer and communications systems supporting our operations 
peak trading times and times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even fail for periods of time as could general power or telecommunications failures or natural disasters  despite the contingency plans we have in place 
moreover  we have varying levels of contingency plan coverage among our non us subsidiaries 
the presence of computer viruses can also cause failure of our systems 
as our business expands  we will need to expand our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions 
if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled  we could incur financial loss  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations  initiate regulatory inquiries or proceedings  file lawsuits against us  trade less frequently through us or cease doing business with us 
rapid changes in technology due to the high demand for technology based services in the securities industry  we are subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
also  customer demands become greater and more sophisticated as the dissemination of information to customers increases 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services  products and technologies in a timely and cost effective manner and to adapt to the technological advancements and changing standards  we will be less able to compete effectively  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk from third parties that owe us money  securities  or other obligations  including our customers and trading counterparties 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
substantially all of the clearing and depository operations for our broker dealer subsidiaries are performed pursuant to clearing agreements with their clearing brokers  who review the credit risk of trading counterparties  as deemed necessary 
volatile securities markets  credit markets and regulatory changes increase our exposure to credit risk  which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
infrastructure and research in connection with our research and product development activities  as well as capital expenditures to improve other aspects of our business  we incur substantial expenses that do not vary directly  at least in the short term  with fluctuations in securities transaction volumes and revenues 
in the event of a material reduction in revenues  we may not be able to reduce such expenses quickly and  as a result  we could experience reduced profitability or losses 
conversely  sudden surges in transaction volumes can result in increased profit and profit margin 
to ensure that we have the capacity to process projected increases in transaction volumes  we have historically made substantial capital and operating expenditures in advance of such projected increases  including during periods of low transaction volumes 
in the event that such growth in transaction volumes does not occur or we are not able to bring a research or product idea to fruition or do not accurately forecast the demand for any such product  the expenses related to such investments could cause reduced profitability or losses 
dependence on major customers customers may discontinue use of our services at any time 
the loss of any significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the loss of significant posit customers could result in lower share volumes of securities submitted to posit systems around the world  which may adversely affect the liquidity of the systems  reducing their attractiveness to our customers and adversely affecting our trading volumes  operating results and financial condition 
the chart below sets forth our dependence on our three largest clients individually  as well as on our ten largest clients in the aggregate  expressed as a percentage of total revenues of total consolidated revenue largest customer second largest customer third largest customer ten largest customers employee misconduct or errors employee misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 
misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us  improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information 
similarly  employee errors in recording or executing transactions for customers can cause us to enter into transactions that customers may disavow and refuse to settle 
these transactions expose us to risk of loss  which can be material  until we detect the errors in question and unwind or reverse the transactions 
as with any unsettled transaction  adverse movements in the prices of the securities involved in these transactions before we unwind or reverse them can increase this risk 
dependence on third party suppliers for key services we depend on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading systems  computers  communication infrastructure and other equipment  and related support and maintenance 
we cannot be certain that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient and cost effective manner or that they will be able to meet our expanding needs 
if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of these services in the event of a disruption in the services  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 
risks of infringement of our intellectual property rights we rely upon patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our rights in our proprietary technology  methods and products 
however  a third party may still try to challenge  invalidate or circumvent the mechanisms we select to protect our rights 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us in the past several years  there has been a proliferation of so called business method patents applicable to the computer and financial services industries 
under current law  us patent applications remain secret for months and may  depending upon where else such applications are filed  remain secret until issuance of a patent 
thus it is not economically practicable to determine in advance whether our products or services may infringe the present or future patent rights of others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology from disclosure or that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
it is likely that from time to time we may also face claims that use of technology material to our business operations infringes on rights of third parties or we may be called upon to defend a joint venture partner  customer or licensee against such third party claims  which could consume valuable time  result in costly litigation or cause delays  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business

this reflects higher costs in our international operations  driven by currency exchange rate impact of million as a result of the weakened us dollar 
excluding the impact from foreign currency fluctuations  international operating expenses decreased by million primarily in compensation and other general and administrative costs  offset by an increase in transaction processing costs from the related revenue increases and increases in executions in higher priced international markets  such as continental europe and japan 
the us operations also had a decline in expenses by million primarily from a decrease in costs related to our revenue decrease 
compensation and employee benefits our higher consolidated compensation expense was mainly driven by employee separation costs million  the impact of foreign currency translation million and an increase in average headcount in our us operations

average us headcount in was compared to in the headcount increase is principally related to i sarbanes oxley compliance activities  ii new product introductions and support  iii sales efforts  and iv our march  acquisition of the of radical that we did not already own

this was partially offset by headcount reductions in transaction processing our higher consolidated transaction processing expenses were mainly driven by revenue growth and business mix changes in our international operations partially offset by lower costs in the us lower us transaction processing costs in reflect i the decline in product revenues  ii a reduction in the hoenig division s execution costs as a result of their integration into itg inc as of september  and iii lower clearing and execution costs primarily due to rate reductions

software royalties software royalties principally relate to posit royalties  which are contractually fixed as a percentage of posit revenues and reflect a decrease in posit revenues in in  royalties were at a slightly higher rate for itg europe than in which was consistent with those paid in the us and also included payments to radical corporation  a provider of an equity front end software trading platform  for licensing their radical system prior to our march  purchase of the remaining of radical that we did not already own 
occupancy and equipment the decrease in consolidated occupancy and equipment costs  which are primarily comprised of fixed costs  reflects lower depreciation costs

compensation and employee benefits our compensation expense increase of million was mainly driven by i the full year impact of our acquisition of hoenig  ii the expensing of stock based compensation  and iii the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  specifically the weaker us dollar  increasing the relative costs of compensation in our international operations 
these increases were offset by savings achieved in following our december restructuring 
us compensation expense decreased million despite the inclusion of i hoenig  which added an incremental million to us compensation costs in  ii the expensing of performance based stock options of million in  and iii severance costs due to additional headcount reductions in these additional costs were more than offset by the savings achieved in from our december restructuring approximately million  as well as declines in other benefits such as performance based bonuses in weighted average us headcount excluding hoenig  for comparability in was compared to in total international compensation expense increased million primarily from i the hoenig acquisition  which accounted for million of the increase  ii exchange rate fluctuation million  iii additional severance for international staffing reductions in  and iv increases in compensation in canada and europe 
these additional costs were partially offset by the headcount reduction as part of the december restructuring 
transaction processing consolidated transaction processing expenses decreased million in us transaction processing costs declined by million in driven primarily by rate decreases from our clearance and settlement  and execution providers  as well as the overall decline in our share volume 
these lower rates included ecn costs  which declined million reflecting a decrease in our ecn rates in these savings were offset by the inclusion of additional hoenig transaction processing costs of million 
international transaction processing costs increased million in primarily from i the increase in share volume and contract value of transactions in  ii exchange rate fluctuation million and iii the inclusion of hoenig million 
software royalties software royalties principally relate to posit royalties  which are contractually fixed as a percentage of posit revenues 
accordingly  declines in our consolidated posit revenues resulted in declines in software royalty expense

restructuring charges in order to align our infrastructure with expected levels of trading volume  we terminated employees in december  including personnel employed in our us operations and personnel employed in our international operations 
as a result of this decision  we recorded a million pretax charge consisting of severance and related expenses for the employees 
there were no such charges in other general and administrative consolidated general and administrative costs increased million in primarily due to i write down of the carrying value of two new york stock exchange seats that we obtained as part of the hoenig acquisition million  ii write down of stock exchange trading rights in hong kong which we also obtained in the hoenig acquisition million  iii the inclusion of a full year of hoenig costs million in  iv higher software amortization million primarily due to our releases of new versions of itg opt and triton in late  v exchange rate fluctuations  vi increases in corporate insurance  particularly directors and officers insurance  vii higher consulting costs related to business and product marketing  information systems and other non recurring consulting activities and short term projects including the mandates of the sarbanes oxley act  and viii write off of our investment in inference group llc 
these cost increases were partially offset by reversal of accrued interest million related to the resolution of an internal revenue service examination of research and development tax credits taken on our tax returns prior to income tax expense our effective tax rate includes the reversal of a tax reserve of million related to an internal revenue service examination of research and development tax credits taken on our tax returns prior to excluding the impact of this item  our effective tax rate would have been  compared with in critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many instances  the application of such principles requires management to make estimates or to apply subjective principles to particular facts and circumstances 
a change in the estimates or a variance in the application  or interpretation of accounting principles generally accepted in the us could yield a materially different accounting result 
below is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies and estimates where we believe that the estimations  judgments or interpretations that we made  if different  would have yielded the most significant differences in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value securities owned  at fair value  securities sold  not yet purchased  at fair value  and investments in limited partnerships in the consolidated statements of financial condition are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  with the related unrealized gains or losses recognized in our results of operations 
the fair value of these instruments is the amount at which these instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced liquidation 
where available  we use the prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer quotations 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  we use estimated fair values as determined by management 
at december   we held shares of archipelago holdings inc  acquired under an equity entitlement program  which held its initial public offering in august prior to its ipo  these shares were held at a fair value of zero as determined by management since a market price had not been observable or measurable 
although a market price was available at december   we were prohibited from selling our shares through february accordingly  following the specialized accounting practices available for broker dealers  the restriction on trading in archipelago holdings was considered in arriving at the appropriate fair value of the shares  which value was reduced from the quoted market value of million at december   to million 
during  a technology venture capital fund in which we had invested million in  ceased operations 
based upon our mark to market assessment of its portfolio  we wrote off most of this investment in  as most of its portfolio companies had ceased operations 
in the latter half of  we received distributions from the fund as part of its liquidation process which exceeded our carrying value by million 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  prospectively to all awards granted  modified  or settled after january  under this method of adoption  compensation expense will be recognized based on the fair value of stock options  employee stock purchase plan shares and restricted stock units granted for fiscal and future years over the related service period 
in and  the company granted performance based stock options based on a cumulative three year performance metric and recorded stock based compensation expense for these options 
under the fair value approach  management employs considerable judgment in estimating  on the date of grant  the options expected life and expected volatility 
additionally  management estimates the number of options that are expected to vest based on the expected outcomes of the performance related conditions 
accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangibles determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
for initial valuations  we retain valuation experts to provide us with independent fair value determinations of goodwill and other intangibles 
in addition  we perform valuations based on internally developed models 
specifically  a number of different methods are used in estimating the fair value of acquired intangibles as well as testing goodwill and other intangibles for impairment 
such methods include the income approach and the market approach 
significant estimates and assumptions applied in these approaches include  but are not limited to  projection of future cash flows  the applicable discount rate  perpetual growth rates  and adjustments made to assess the characteristics and relative performance of similar assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective january   we discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be assessed no less than annually for impairment 
as of the most recent impairment test  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit was not impaired 
other intangibles with definite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are assessed for impairment on an annual basis or sooner when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangibles for the years ended december    and was as follows amortization expense millions other intangibles as is the normal practice in our industry  the values we report for exchange seats  which are included within other assets in our financial statements  are valued at cost or a lesser amount if there is an other than temporary impairment in value 
during third quarter  we wrote down the carrying value of two nyse seats that were previously valued at million each as a result of the continued reduction in nyse seat prices 
as we believe this decline in value is other than temporary in nature  we have taken a million write down to reflect the fair value of these seats at million each 
the fair value was determined by referencing actual nyse seat sales occurring during our assessment of the nature and extent of impairment of the nyse seats requires considerable judgment by management with respect to evaluating external factors 
the following table indicates our sensitivity to potential future impairment charges from further declines in market value of our nyse exchange seats and potential declines in the fair value of our goodwill potential future impairment in millions nyse exchange seats goodwill us operations international operations soft dollar programs we permit institutional customers to allocate a portion of their gross commissions to pay for research products and other services provided by third parties 
the amounts so allocated for those purposes are commonly referred to as soft dollar arrangements 
we are accounting for the cost of independent research and directed brokerage arrangements on an accrual basis 
commission revenue is recorded when earned on a trade date basis 
our accounting for commission revenues includes the guidance contained in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenues gross versus net  and accordingly  payments relating to soft dollars are netted against the commission revenues 
prepaid soft dollar research balances are included in receivables from brokers  dealers and other and accrued soft dollar research payable balances are classified as accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we continuously monitor our customer account balances and maintain an allowance for soft dollar advances which is comprised of a general reserve based on historical collections performance plus a specific reserve for certain known customer issues 
if actual bad debts are greater than the reserves calculated based on historical trends and known customer issues  we may be required to record additional bad debt expense  which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the periods in which such additional expense would occur 
soft dollar revenues and related prepaid and accrued soft dollar research balances for the years ended december    and were as follows millions net soft dollar commissions prepaid soft dollar research  gross allowance for prepaid soft dollar research prepaid soft dollar research  net of allowance accrued soft dollar research payable income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resource requirements result from our working capital needs  primarily consisting of compensation and benefits and transaction processing fees 
historically  cash from operations has met all working capital requirements 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements 
in asia  we maintain working capital facilities with a bank relating to our clearing and settlement activities 
these facilities are in the form of overdraft protection totaling approximately million and are supported by million in restricted cash deposits 
a substantial portion of our assets are liquid  consisting of cash and cash equivalents or assets readily convertible into cash 
we generally invest our excess cash in money market funds and other short term investments that mature within days or less 
additionally  securities owned at fair value include highly liquid  variable state and municipal obligations  auction rate preferred stock  mutual fund investments  common stock and warrants 
at december   cash and cash equivalents and securities owned  at fair value amounted to million and net receivables from brokers  dealers and other due within days totaled million 
in addition  we held million of total cash in restricted or segregated bank or clearing broker accounts at december  we also invest a portion of our excess cash balances in cash enhanced strategies  which we believe should yield higher returns without significant effect on risk 
as of december   we had investments in limited partnerships totaling million  all of which were invested in marketable securities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million in as compared to million in the million decrease was primarily attributable to changes in working capital as well as non cash gains included in net income 
the working capital changes include the impact of a million increase in investments in state and municipal government securities during  which are classified on the consolidated statements of financial condition as securities owned  at fair value  as well as a million reduction in payables to brokers  dealers and others  partially offset by a million reduction in receivables from brokers  dealers and others 
net cash used in investing activities reflects i completion of our acquisition of radical corporation by acquiring the of its outstanding shares that we did not already own  ii investments in computer hardware and software  as well as capitalizable software development projects  partially offset by iii proceeds from the sale of of our ownership interest in ktg  formerly a wholly owned subsidiary  to iress  an australia based developer of financial market systems 
our remaining interest was contributed to a new canadian joint venture with iress 
net cash used in financing activities reflects purchases of million shares of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program  which were funded from our available cash resources 
as part of our share repurchase program  our board of directors authorizes management to use its discretion to purchase an agreed upon maximum number of shares of common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
during  we purchased million shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  totaling million 
at december   we had the authorization to purchase an additional million shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program 
historically  all regulatory capital needs of itg inc  alternet and itg execution services have been provided by cash from operations 
although we believe that cash flows from operations will continue to provide itg inc  alternet and itg execution services with sufficient regulatory capital  we are considering the establishment of a credit facility to supplement our existing regulatory capital  as needed 
at december   itg inc  alternet and itg execution services had net capital of million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  was in excess of required net capital 
in addition  our canadian  australian  asian and european operations had regulatory capital in excess of the minimum requirements applicable to each business as of december  of approximately million  million  million  and million respectively 
as a result of the february  posit transaction  discussed in license and relationship with barra  itg inc s excess net capital on february  approximated million although we believe that the combination of our existing net regulatory capital and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet regulatory capital requirements  we are considering the establishment of a credit facility to supplement our existing regulatory capital  as needed  as a shortfall in net regulatory capital would have a material adverse effect on us 
as of december   itg inc held a million cash balance on behalf of its hoenig division in a segregated deposit account with its clearing broker for the benefit of customers under certain directed brokerage arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are involved in the execution of various customer securities transactions 
securities transactions are subject to the credit risk of counterparties or customer nonperformance 
in connection with the settlement of non us securities transactions  investment technology group  inc has provided third party financial institutions with guarantees in amounts up to a maximum of million 
in the event that a customer of itg s subsidiaries fails to settle a securities transaction  or if the related itg subsidiaries were unable to honor trades with a customer  investment technology group  inc would be required to perform for the amount of such securities up to the million cap 
however  transactions are collateralized by the underlying security  thereby reducing the associated risk to changes in the market value of the security through settlement date 
therefore  the settlement of these transactions is not expected to have a material effect upon our financial statements 
it is also our policy to review  as necessary  the credit worthiness of each counterparty and customer 
aggregate contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments amounted to million in the aggregate and consisted of the following dollars in thousands payments due by period thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations minimum compensation employment agreements purchase obligations total business combinations on september   we acquired hoenig group inc  which  through its operating affiliates  provides trade execution  independent research and other services to alternative investment funds and money managers globally 
under the terms of the transaction  hoenig group inc stockholders received approximately million  or per share  of which approximately million  or per share  have been placed into an escrow account 
such escrow requirement relates to the pursuit  by the contingent payment rights committee cprc established at the time of acquisition on behalf of hoenig group inc shareholders  of certain insurance and other claims in connection with the million pre tax loss announced by hoenig group inc on may  as a result of unauthorized trading in foreign securities  by a former employee of hoenig company limited  in violation of hoenig s policies and procedures 
in december  the cprc completed its pursuit of these claims on behalf of the former hoenig shareholders and distributed million or approximately cents per share in cash to such shareholders 
we anticipate that in january  determinations will be available with respect to tax liabilities associated with the amounts recovered by the cprc 
in the event that such tax liabilities are less than the amounts remaining in the escrow  such remaining amounts will be distributed to the former hoenig group  inc shareholders 
while the amount of any such payment remains to be determined  we expect that it will not exceed 
per share or approximately 
in the event a second payment is made  it will represent the full and final distribution from the escrow 
in connection with this acquisition  we incurred transaction costs consisting primarily of professional fees of approximately million  which have been included in the purchase price 
the purchase price was allocated to those assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair value of hoenig s net assets as of september  approximately million was allocated to the hoenig trade name  which is being amortized over three years 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired was million and has been allocated to goodwill 
on march   we acquired the remaining of radical corporation radical that we did not already own for million in cash 
the radical business augments our product offerings for the active trading community 
the total purchase price of million is subject to a potential purchase price adjustment not to exceed million based upon performance over the one year period following our february  call option exercise 
the consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the above businesses from their respective dates of acquisition 
on november   inference group llc  our former asset management subsidiary  was reorganized 
in connection with this reorganization  we sold of inference group llc to the inference group management team and retained a minority ownership interest 
in the fourth quarter of  inference group llc ceased substantially all asset management operations 
accordingly  we took an asset impairment charge of  representing the full cost basis of our investment 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  titled share based payment 
as a result  the fair value based method of accounting for stock based payments will be required on a modified prospective basis  meaning any previously granted but unvested awards will be recorded as an expense on a prorated basis over the remaining vesting period 
we voluntarily adopted the fair value method approach january  on a prospective basis and therefore  the impact the revised statement will have on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows will be minimal 
sfas no 
r is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after june  subsequent events in  jefferies company  inc and barra inc 
barra formed a joint venture for the purpose of developing and marketing posit 
in  jefferies company  inc assigned all of its rights relating to the joint venture and the license agreement to us 
on december  we signed an agreement with morgan stanley capital international inc msci to acquire the interest in the posit joint venture we did not own from barra posit inc  a subsidiary of msci 
this transaction was completed on february  giving us sole ownership of the posit joint venture 
the purchase price consisted of an initial payment of million  paid at the closing of the transaction  and a contingent component payable over the ten years following closing equal to of the revenues from the business of the posit joint venture 
at our discretion  we have the right to accelerate these contingent payments at any time during the ten year period 
this transaction will result in significant savings from decreased royalty payments partially offset by i amortization costs related to the intellectual property  ii forgone investment income on the million outlay  and iii the cost of additional headcount 
on february   we acquired e crossnet  to offer professional investors in europe an integrated equities crossing system with access to an expanded liquidity pool 
we are in the process of applying to register as a foreign company securities corporation with the japanese financial service agency under the foreign securities company law of japan and become a member firm of the japan securities dealers association and the japan investor protection fund in order to commence trading activity in japan in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the potential for adverse changes in the value of a company s financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions 
we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices to the extent we own such instruments in our portfolio 
we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
we continually evaluate our exposure to market risk and oversee the establishment of policies  procedures and controls to ensure that market risks are identified and analyzed on an ongoing basis 
we have performed sensitivity analyses on different tests of market risk as described in the following sections to estimate the impacts of a hypothetical change in market conditions on the fair value of securities owned and the us dollar value of us dollar based revenues associated with our international operations 
estimated potential losses assume the occurrence of certain adverse market conditions 
such estimates do not consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors and also do not represent management s expectations of projected losses in fair value 
we do not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk  foreign currency risk or equity price risk in the near future 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to interest sensitive financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest sensitive financial instruments will decline in value if interest rates increase 
our interest bearing investment portfolio primarily consists of short term  high credit quality money market funds  highly liquid variable rate municipal securities  auction rate preferred stock and treasury notes 
the aggregate fair market value of our portfolio was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our interest bearing investments are not insured and because of the short term high quality nature of the investments are not likely to fluctuate significantly in market value 
for the years ended december  and we estimated that a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates would have resulted in a million and million decline in the value of our portfolio  respectively 
foreign currency risk we currently operate and continue to expand globally in a variety of ways  including through our operations in canada  australia  europe and hong kong  and through the development of specially tailored versions of our services 
additionally  we maintain development facilities in israel 
our investments and development activities in these countries expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily between the us dollar and the british pound sterling  euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  hong kong dollar and israeli new shekel 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of us dollar based revenue decreases 
to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase 
we have not engaged in derivative financial instruments as a means of hedging this risk 
non us dollar cash balances held overseas are generally kept at levels necessary to meet current operating and capitalization needs 
approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and were denominated in non us dollar currencies 
for the years ended december  and  we estimated that a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in net income from our international operations of million and million  respectively 
equity price risk equity price risk results from exposure to changes in the prices of equity securities 
at times  we do hold positions overnight due to client or company errors 
equity price risk can arise from liquidating such positions 
accordingly  we maintain policies and procedures regarding the management of our errors and accommodations proprietary trading accounts 
it is our policy to attempt to trade out of all positions arising from errors and accommodations immediately while balancing our exposure to market risk 
certain positions may therefore be liquidated over a period of time in an effort to minimize market impact 
we manage equity price risk associated with open positions through the establishment and monitoring of trading policies and through controls and review procedures that ensure communication and timely resolution of trading issues 
our operations and trading departments review all open trades daily 
additionally  our clearing broker notifies us of all known trade discrepancies on the day following the trade date 
we have also established approval policies that include review by a supervisory principal of any proprietary trading activity 
our cash management strategy seeks to optimize excess liquid assets by preserving principal  maintaining liquidity to satisfy capital requirements  minimizing risk and maximizing our after tax rate of return 
our policy is to invest in high quality credit issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and invest in tax efficient strategies 
our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and re investment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to reductions in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor that we believe is adverse to our investment strategy 
for working capital purposes  we invest only in money market instruments 
cash balances that are not needed for normal operations are invested in a tax efficient manner in instruments with appropriate maturities and levels of risk to correspond to expected liquidity needs 
we currently have investments in municipal bonds  auction rate preferred bonds and  to a lesser extent  common stock 
to the extent that we invest in marketable equity securities  we ensure portfolio liquidity by investing in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december  and  our cash and cash equivalents and securities owned were approximately million and million  respectively 
our investments in limited partnership funds require approval of executive management and or the board of directors 
as of december   we had investments in limited partnerships totaling million  all of which were invested in marketable securities 
the limited partnerships employ either a hedged convertible strategy or a long short strategy to capitalize on short term price movements
