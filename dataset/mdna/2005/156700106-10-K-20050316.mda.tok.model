accounting pronouncements in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted emerging issues task force no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share eitf 
eitf requires securities issuable under contingently convertible instruments be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation 
the company s million series k senior notes are convertible into common stock under various contingent circumstances  including the common stock attaining a specified trading price in excess of the notes fixed conversion price 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company s diluted earnings per share and diluted shares outstanding reflect the application of eitf prior periods have been restated to reflect this change in accounting 
the company has elected to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as allowed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for the issuance of stock options 
sfas r requires the company to measure the cost of the employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based upon the fair value of the award on the grant date 
such cost will be recognized as an expense over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas r is effective for all awards granted after its effective date of july  in accordance with sfas r  compensation cost is also recognized over the applicable remaining vesting period for any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
the company expects the adoption of sfas r to decrease diluted earnings per share by approximately 
in on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the long lived asset 
although the company generally has had no legal obligation to remove obsolete assets  depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for the company s telephone operations subject to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value 
notwithstanding the adoption of sfas  sfas requires the company to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets 
therefore  the company did not adopt the provisions of sfas for its telephone operations subject to sfas for the company s telephone operations acquired from verizon in which are not subject to sfas and its other non regulated operations  the company has not accrued a liability for anticipated removal costs in the past 
for these reasons  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas  which provides standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and for pre existing instruments as of the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to i revenue recognition  ii allowance for doubtful accounts  iii pension and postretirement benefits and iv long lived assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes that certain critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity  including those described below 
revenue recognition 
certain of the company s interstate network access and data revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the fcc  the remainder of such revenues is derived from revenue sharing arrangements with other lecs administered by the national exchange carrier association 
in the second quarter of  the company revised certain estimates for recognizing interstate revenues 
previously  the company initially recognized interstate revenues at a rate of return lower than the authorized rate of return prescribed by the fcc to allow for potential decreases in demand or other factor changes which could decrease the achieved rate of return over the respective monitoring periods 
as the monitoring periods progressed  the company recorded additional revenues ratably up to the achieved rate of return 
in the second quarter of  the company began generally recognizing such interstate network access revenues at the authorized rate of return  unless the actual achieved rate of return was lower than authorized 
the telecommunications act of allows local exchange carriers to file access tariffs on a streamlined basis and  if certain criteria are met  deems those tariffs lawful 
tariffs that have been deemed lawful in effect nullify an interexchange carrier s ability to seek refunds should the earnings from the tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of return prescribed by the fcc 
certain of the company s telephone subsidiaries file interstate tariffs directly with the fcc using this streamlined filing approach 
as of december   the amount of the company s earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return reflected as a liability on the balance sheet for the combined and monitoring periods aggregated approximately million 
the settlement period related to i the monitoring period lapses on september  and ii the monitoring period lapses on september  the company will continue to monitor the legal status of any pending or future proceedings that could impact its entitlement to these funds  and may recognize as revenue some or all of the over earnings at the end of the settlement period or as the legal status becomes more certain 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the collectibility of its accounts receivable  the company assesses a number of factors  including a specific customer s or carrier s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  the company records both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount the company ultimately expects to collect from customers and carriers 
if circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that the company s past collection experience is no longer relevant  the company s estimate of the recoverability of its accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
pension and postretirement benefits 
the amounts recognized in the company s financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which utilizes many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
a significant assumption used in determining the company s pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
for  the company lowered its expected long term rate of return on plan assets to  reflecting the expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets  and used the same rate in another assumption used in the determination of the company s pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate  which is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate bonds 
the company lowered its assumed discount rate to at december  from at december  changes in the discount rate are not generally expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
intangible and long lived assets 
the company is subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets under two accounting standards  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment at least annually and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value 
under sfas  impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value  goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value 
the company completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment as of september  under sfas and determined its goodwill is not impaired as of such date 
under sfas  the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value

inflation the effects of increased costs historically have been mitigated by the company s ability to recover certain costs over time applicable to its regulated telephone operations through the rate making process 
however  lecs operating over of the company s total access lines are now governed by alternative regulation plans  some of which restrict or delay the company s ability to recover increased costs 
additional future regulatory changes may further alter the company s ability to recover increased costs in its regulated operations 
for the properties acquired from verizon in  which are regulated under price cap regulation for interstate purposes  price changes are limited to the rate of inflation  minus a productivity offset 
for additional information regarding the current regulatory environment  see regulation and competition 
as operating expenses in the company s nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation  the company  to the extent permitted by competition  attempts to recover the costs by increasing prices for its services and equipment 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its long term debt obligations 
the company has estimated its market risk using sensitivity analysis 
market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
fair value of long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis  using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term financing markets 
the results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below  although the actual results may differ from these estimates 
at december   the fair value of the company s long term debt was estimated to be billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the company s long term debt of and an overall weighted maturity of years compared to terms and rates available on such date in long term financing markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of basis points in interest rates ten percent of the company s overall weighted average borrowing rate 
such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in the fair value of the company s long term debt 
as of december   after giving effect to interest rate swaps currently in place  approximately of the company s long term debt obligations were fixed rate 
the company seeks to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates 
from time to time  the company uses derivative instruments to i lock in or swap its exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or ii to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates 
the company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
management periodically reviews the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure 
at december   the company had outstanding four fair value interest rate hedges associated with the full million aggregate principal amount of its series l senior notes  due  that pay interest at a fixed rate of 
these hedges are fixed to variable interest rate swaps that effectively convert the company s fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates that range from the six month london interbank offered rate libor plus to the six month libor plus  with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedges in august at december   the company realized a rate under these hedges of 
interest expense was reduced by million during as a result of these hedges 
the aggregate fair market value of these hedges was million at december  and is reflected both as a liability and as a decrease in the company s underlying long term debt on the december  balance sheet 
with respect to these hedges  market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value 
a hypothetical increase in the forward rates would result in a million decrease in the fair value of these hedges 
as of december   the company also had outstanding cash flow hedges that effectively locked in the interest rate on a majority of certain anticipated debt transactions that ultimately were completed in february the company locked in the interest rate of i million of year debt remarketed in february at and ii million of year debt issued in february at 
such cash flow hedges had a fair value of  as of december  and are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
in january  the company also entered into a separate cash flow hedge which effectively locked in the interest rate for an additional million of year debt issued in february at 
in february  upon settlement of such hedges  the company i received  related to the year debt remarketing which will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt and ii paid million related to the year debt issuance which will be amortized as an increase in interest expense over the year term of the debt 
effective may   the company terminated a fair value interest rate hedge associated with million aggregate principal amount of its series h senior notes and received million cash upon settlement  which represented the fair value of the hedge at the termination date 
such amount is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense through  the maturity date of the series h notes 
development of billing system the company recently implemented a new integrated billing and customer care system 
the costs to develop such system have been accounted for in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the capitalized costs of the system aggregated million before accumulated amortization at december  and are being amortized over a year period 
virtually all of the company s customers were converted to the new system in late in early  the company implemented software upgrades and other changes to enhance the productivity and efficiency of the system  the cost of which was not material 
during the development phase of the new billing system  the company capitalized payroll related costs of employees dedicated to the project 
the company began expensing these costs in late  but does not expect the impact thereof to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations

the following table reflects the company s debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for the years ended december debt to total capitalization ratio of earnings from continuing operations to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends regulation and competition the communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory  legislative  competitive and technological changes 
these changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies 
events affecting the communications industry 
in  the united states congress enacted the telecommunications act of the act  which obligates lecs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the lec s network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition 
under the act s rural telephone company exemption  approximately of the company s telephone access lines are exempt from certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria 
during  the fcc released new rules outlining the obligations of incumbent lecs to lease to competitors elements of their circuit switched networks on an unbundled basis at prices that substantially limited the profitability of these arrangements to incumbent lecs 
on march   a federal appellate court vacated significant portions of these rules  including the standards used to determine which unbundled network elements must be made available to competitors 
in response to this court decision  on february   the fcc released rules effective march  that require incumbent lecs to lease a network element only in those situations where competing carriers genuinely would be impaired without access to such network element  and where the unbundling would not interfere with the development of facilities based competition 
these rules are further designed to remove unbundling obligations over time as competing carriers deploy their own networks and local exchange competition increases 
prior to and since the enactment of the act  the fcc and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition 
coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the reduction of regulatory oversight of lecs 
these cumulative changes  coupled with various technological developments  have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with lecs services 
wireless services entities also increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with lecs 
as mandated by the act  in may the fcc modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies 
the fcc adopted an interim mechanism for a five year period  effective july   based on embedded  or historical  costs that will provide predictable levels of support to rural local exchange carriers  including substantially all of the company s local exchange carriers 
based on recent fcc filings  the company anticipates its revenues from the usf high cost loop support program will be approximately million lower than levels due to increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used by the fcc to allocate funds among all recipients 
wireless and other competitive service providers continue to seek eligible telecommunications carrier etc status in order to be eligible to receive usf support  which  coupled with changes in usage of telecommunications services  have placed stresses on the usf s funding mechanism 
these developments have placed additional financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to provide support to all eligible service providers  including support payments the company receives from the high cost loop support program 
as a result of the continued increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor caused by limited growth in the size of the high cost loop support program and changes in requests for support from the usf  the company believes the aggregate level of payments it receives from the usf will continue to decline in the near term under the fcc s current rules 
on august   the federal state joint board on universal service released a notice requesting comments on the fcc s current rules for the provision of high cost support for rural companies  including comments on whether eligibility requirements should be amended in a manner that would adversely affect larger rural lecs such as the company 
the fcc has taken various other steps in anticipation of restructuring universal service support mechanisms  including opening a docket that will change the method of funding contributions 
the fcc is expected to act before its current rules are scheduled to expire on june  congress is also exploring various universal service issues ranging from targeted universal service legislation to re writing the act 
the company has been and will continue to be active in monitoring these developments 
technological developments have led to the development of new services that compete with traditional lec services 
technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit switched telephone service over their cable networks  and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this opportunity 
recent improvements in the quality of voice over internet protocol voip service have led several large cable television and telephone companies  as well as start up companies  to substantially increase their offerings of voip service to business and residential customers 
voip providers route calls over the internet  without use of ilec s circuit switches and  in certain cases  without use of ilec s networks to carry their communications traffic 
voip providers use existing broadband networks to deliver flat rate  all distance calling plans that may be priced below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone services for several reasons  including lower network cost structures and the current ability of voip providers to use ilecs networks without paying access charges 
however  the service must be purchased in addition to the cost of the broadband connection 
in december  the fcc initiated rulemaking that is expected to address the effect of voip on intercarrier compensation  universal service and emergency services 
on march   the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the appropriate regulatory treatment of voip service and related issues 
although the fcc s rulemaking regarding voip enabled services remains pending  the fcc has adopted orders establishing broad guidelines for the regulation of such services  including an april order in which the fcc ruled that the ip telephony service of at t  which converts voice calls to ip format for routing over the public switched telephone network  is a regulated telecommunications service subject to interstate access charges 
in addition  in november  the fcc ruled that internet based services provided by vonage holdings corporation should be subject to federal rather than state jurisdiction 
several state commissions have filed appeals of this decision to various federal appellate courts 
also pending at the fcc is a petition filed by level communications  inc asking the fcc to forbear from imposing interstate or intrastate access charges on internet based calls that originate or terminate on the public switched telephone network 
there can be no assurance that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ilecs  or that voip providers will not successfully compete for the company s customers 
in  the fcc opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications industry for payments between carriers originating  terminating  carrying or delivering telecommunications traffic 
the fcc has received intercarrier compensation proposals from several industry groups  and on february  solicited comments on all proposals previously submitted to it 
the company is involved in this proceeding and will continue to monitor the implications of these plans to its operations 
recent events affecting the company 
during the last few years  several states in which the company has substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the lec business 
the number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in the company s service areas has increased in recent years  especially in the markets acquired from verizon in and  and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future 
state alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of the company s lecs have also affected revenue growth recently 
certain long distance carriers continue to request that the company reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its lecs 
in addition  the company has recently experienced reductions in intrastate traffic  partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless and electronic mail services 
in the company incurred a reduction in its intrastate revenues of approximately million compared to primarily due to these factors 
the corresponding decrease in compared to was million 
the company believes such trend of decreased intrastate minutes will continue in  although the magnitude of such decrease cannot be precisely estimated 
in january  the louisiana public service commission staff began reviewing the feasibility of converting the million louisiana local optional service fund los fund into a state universal service fund 
currently  the los fund is funded primarily by bellsouth  which proposes to expand the base of contributors into the los fund 
the company currently receives approximately million from the los fund each year 
although the commission staff has recommended to transfer the fund s million to a state universal service fund  there can be no assurance that the commission will adopt this recommendation or that funding will remain at current levels 
competition to provide traditional lec services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater extent than rural  suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the company s telephone operations are located 
while the company expects its operating revenues in to continue to experience downward pressure due to continued access line losses and reduced network access revenues  the company expects its consolidated revenues to increase in primarily due to increased demand for its long distance  fiber transport  dsl and other nonregulated product offerings including its new video and wireless initiatives 
other matters 
the company s regulated telephone operations except for the properties acquired from verizon in are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the recognition of an asset  reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise 
such regulatory assets and liabilities are required to be recorded and  accordingly  reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to sfas the company is monitoring the ongoing applicability of sfas to its regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory  competitive and legislative environments  and it is possible that changes in regulation  legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in the company s telephone operations no longer being subject to sfas in the near future 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuance of application of fasb statement no 
sfas  specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria for application of sfas sfas requires the elimination of the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas but would not have been recognized as assets and liabilities by nonregulated enterprises 
depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for the company s telephone operations subject to sfas have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value 
notwithstanding the adoption of sfas  sfas requires the company to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets 
therefore  the company did not adopt the provisions of sfas for its telephone operations subject to sfas sfas further provides that the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  included regulatory assets of approximately million primarily deferred costs related to financing costs and regulatory proceedings and regulatory liabilities of approximately million related to estimated removal costs embedded in accumulated depreciation as described above 
net deferred income tax assets related to the regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above were million 
when and if the company s regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of sfas  the company does not expect to record any impairment charge related to the carrying value of the property  plant and equipment of its regulated telephone operations 
additionally  upon the discontinuance of sfas  the company would be required to revise the lives of its property  plant and equipment to reflect the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company does not expect such revisions in asset lives will have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
for regulatory purposes  the accounting and reporting of the company s telephone subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of sfas the company has certain obligations based on federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment 
costs of compliance through have not been material  and the company currently has no reason to believe that such costs will become material
