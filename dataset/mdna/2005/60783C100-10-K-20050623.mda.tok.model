item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of modular classrooms in the state of california and a significant provider of commercial and light industrial modular buildings in california  nevada  arizona  new mexico  utah  colorado  texas  florida and other neighboring states 
we are expanding our classroom offerings in all locations in response to increasing demand for new classroom products 
key factors which impact demand for our products include a growing population and the resulting increase in school age children in the regions we serve  natural disasters such as the hurricanes in florida during and increased demand from military bases 
demand increased in resulting in increase in net sales over the prior year 
throughout our raw material costs were significantly and adversely affected by the rapid rise in steel costs which nearly doubled for certain steel used in our products 
lumber and plywood costs also increased significantly during pricing for these commodities has stabilized in recent months and we believe that a more stable pricing environment will continue 
we responded by raising our selling prices to the extent possible  but many of our existing contracts were fixed price contracts that did not allow us to pass through raw material price increases 
our profit margins were eroded because we were not able to fully offset our increased costs through price increases to our customers 
whenever possible  we attempt to negotiate a provision in our new contracts that will allow us to pass through cost increases to our customers 
we are one of several contractors working on the construction of the heritage high school project in brentwood  california 
we bid this project in with the understanding that it was to be built in a modular friendly manner  but this has not occurred 
a number of issues have come up with the architect for the school district as to what we are obligated to do under the contract 
our efforts to resolve these issues have resulted in cost overruns of million which are discussed in greater detail in results of operations below 
severance payments incurred in connection with the departure of three corporate officers  our former chief executive officer  president and secretary  during the quarter ended september  had a significant impact on the full year s performance 
in addition  we had several adjustments to inventory  project costs for some complex permanent modular construction projects and other increases in selling  general administrative sg a costs 
in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of  in we engaged consultants to assist with documentation and testing of our internal controls and added staff at year end to strengthen such controls 
the costs of these measures significantly increased our expenses in and we anticipate that we will incur significant expenses in the future as a result of continued compliance 
we sought additional financing during the quarter ending december  and were able to secure a million subordinated convertible note by december  subsequent to year end we were able to secure a long term debt agreement for a million senior credit facility with a new lender which allowed us to replace the prior lender group 
we view as a transition year as we continue to grow and plan to return to profitability by focusing on several initiatives which include strict inventory management  utilization of national contracts for materials and other services and implementation of lean enterprise improvements 
in recent months  we have focused on higher margin less complex permanent modular construction projects 
as a result  the margin in our backlog of permanent modular construction has improved 
an increased focus on new market opportunities consistent with our manufacturing core competence has also shifted the reliance from complex lower margin projects to higher margin less complex sales in these new markets 

table of contents certain corrections have been made to prior periods related to the initial recognition of an expected receivable for a legal settlement 
the receivable was recorded in the amount of  of which  was recorded in   in and  in after reviewing this accounting treatment  we have revised our current year presentation as a correction of an immaterial error in prior periods 
the result of this correction was a decrease in other assets and retained earnings as of december  of  final settlement of this legal case resulted in  recognized in other income during the effect of this correction on previously reported financial statements is summarized below and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
as reported as corrected income from operations income before income taxes net loss net loss applicable to common shareholders basic loss per share diluted loss per share other assets retained earnings results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of net sales represented by certain items in our statements of operations 
percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross loss profit selling  general and administrative expenses gain on sale of property and equipment covenant amortization loss income from operations interest expense  net other income loss income before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income taxes benefit provision loss income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   increased by million  or approximately  when compared to the prior year 
when compared to the prior year  florida sales of million were up  texas sales of million were up  arizona sales of million were up and california sales of million were up 
the significantly increased sales in florida are a result of the much anticipated 
table of contents school market opening up because of available state and local funding 
the increased sales in arizona are largely attributable to us military troop housing solutions as bases were reorganized 
general improvement in the commercial market sold primarily through dealers also contributed to the sales increase across the company 
california classroom sales  including both relocatable and permanent modular construction declined to million when compared to the prior year 
this decline in net sales is due to timing of specific projects as the overall backlog of california classroom projects grew significantly during the year 
gross loss for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or approximately  when compared to the previous year 
gross loss as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from a gross profit of in the decrease in gross profit was due to several factors 
cost overruns of million were charged to the heritage high school project in brentwood  california 
four million dollars of these costs overruns resulted from events that occurred in and this portion of the cost overrun was identified by us prior to december  the remaining million in additional cost overruns was identified in april and may prior to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements 
these overruns are included in the results because they relate to certain contract conditions that existed as of december  and the subsequent information obtained during april and may allowed for the refinement of the loss estimate on this contract prior to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements 
this refinement is made pursuant to paragraph of the aicpa s statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  which states that cost estimate refinements obtained subsequent to the balance sheet date should be included as an adjustment to the unissued financial statements 
the heritage project was substantially completed in the first week of june of the total million in cost overruns on the heritage project  approximately million was due to additional material  labor  project supervision and related costs 
the additional costs were caused by what we consider differences between the architect s plans and the specifications on which we bid the project 
approximately million of the heritage project cost overruns arose out of a dispute between us and the architect concerning the structural integrity of our welds as called for in the original scope of the project 
at the school district s insistence  the welds were tested in at a direct cost of approximately million 
the district delayed in approving the results of the test and a second test had to be conducted in the test results were approved by the school district and the structural integrity of the welds confirmed in late march the delay in approving the welds resulted in an accelerated timeline to complete the heritage project which  in turn  led to approximately million in additional costs 
the additional costs were primarily labor costs  including the subcontracting of additional laborers and overtime charges 
finally  approximately million of the heritage cost overruns were the result of correcting construction quality problems discovered during as a result of the inspection of the weld tests 
inventory write downs accounted for approximately million of the gross margin erosion 
certain costs were associated with inventory that had been set aside for a specific project that was cancelled during the quarter ended september  it was also determined that the inventory would not be usable in a replacement project 
this inventory included steel and restricted use elevators that were not transferable to other projects 
other steel inventory was written down when it was determined after the quarterly inventory that the specific lengths and specifications were not usable 
another significant factor in the loss incurred during was the increased prices for commodities such as steel  lumber and plywood 
some steel components used in our products nearly doubled in price during and overall our steel costs were up in excess of 
although we experienced a loss in  we expect higher margins in the future because certain of the events we experienced in are not expected to continue into we do not anticipate commodity 
table of contents prices to increase in as they did in  and we are attempting to negotiate the right in our new contracts to pass future commodity price increases on to our customers 
also  we have shifted our product focus away from the lower margin complex customized structures to the higher margin standard buildings 
in  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million over the prior year with sg a costs representing of net sales compared to of net sales in the prior year 
this increase is attributable to costs of million associated with the senior management change that occurred in the quarter ended september   increased professional fees associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  professional and settlement fees associated with certain benefits plans and to increases attributable to higher sales activities across the company 
we expect to continue the higher costs associated with our anticipated growth 
we also expect sarbanes oxley compliance costs to continue with higher internal costs and continued costs associated with independent testing 
the costs associated with the management change and certain professional and other fees are not expected to recur 
we recognized a gain of  on the sale of property in florida in there was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the year ended december  because our fair value as determined by the december  closing stock price exceeded book value 
in the future  goodwill may be impaired by events or circumstances that lower the fair value below book value 
these events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  things such as continued operating losses  unanticipated competition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  or other factors leading to a decline in estimated future cash flows 
in  net interest expense increased from million in to million in the increase is attributable to higher interest rates and a significantly higher average revolver usage due to our operating losses during also included in is the amortization of debt issuance costs of  as a result of the partial extinguishment of the prior credit facility at year end 
interest expense will be higher in due to the increased debt and increased interest rates 
we recognized  of other income related to the settlement of a lawsuit we filed 
the benefit for income tax of million for the year ended december  compares to a provision of million for the year ended december  although we expect to return to profitability in  minimal tax benefit was recognized because our cumulative losses for the three years ended december  created significant negative evidence that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets 
we were not able to overcome the negative evidence with the objective positive evidence and therefore recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million 
our effective tax rate was before the deferred tax asset valuation adjustment compared to prior year at and is expected to remain approximately within this range for year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   declined by million  or approximately  when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in is attributable to lower sales of commercial and industrial buildings  reflecting the general business decline in the non residential building sector and the overall economy 
lower sales were also impacted in the fourth quarter by the shift in marketing approach for non classroom sales as we moved away from a reliance on a dealer network and focused more on direct sales for these products 
we believe that the decline in sales associated with the shift to greater direct sales is temporary as we develop the necessary sales network 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or approximately  when compared to the previous year 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit was due to several factors 
unplanned costs on certain projects were driven by the transition to more complex  multi story projects that accelerated during with these complex projects accounting for more than of the net revenue in  
table of contents up significantly over the prior year  we went through a significant learning curve  particularly for the on site portion of the contracts 
unabsorbed fixed and semi variable costs associated with the decline in production during the fourth quarter contributed significantly to the decline in gross margin for fourth quarter sales of million were down million from the prior year fourth quarter 
during we closed three leased facilities  consolidating three facilities into one in florida and two facilities into one in arizona 
these plant consolidations increased incremental costs in fiscal  as compared to fiscal in  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million over the prior year with sg a costs representing of sales compared to of sales the prior year 
this increase was directly attributable to increased sales activities in the florida classroom market and to the shift to direct sales for non classroom sales 
in  in accordance with sfas no 
 we took an impairment charge to goodwill of  which was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the three month period ended march  effective january  we ceased amortizing our goodwill and continued to amortize the covenants not to compete we received in our acquisitions of businesses over their respective useful lives 
in  covenant amortization decreased million as a result of certain covenants not to compete becoming fully amortized 
the remaining covenants not to compete will be fully amortized in net interest expense declined from million in to million in the decrease was attributable to repayments on long term debt 
as a percentage of net sales  net interest expense decreased to in from in the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million for our effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in income taxes was attributed to the decrease in income before income taxes and a decrease in estimated taxes for tax settlements 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations and capital expenditures mostly with cash generated internally by operations  and borrowings under various credit facilities as well as cash received from exercised options 
during the year ended december  we used cash of approximately million for operations  for the years ended december  and  our operations provided cash in the amounts of approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of million 
cash increased over the prior year due to the sale of a senior secured  convertible note presented in more detail below 
accounts receivable increased primarily due to the higher revenues occurring during the fourth quarter of compared to  resulting from favorable market conditions and recovery over the prior year 
inventories increased primarily due to increased purchases of steel during as we attempted to manage both price impact and possible shortages resulting from the world wide steel commodity issues experienced throughout current liabilities increased during the fourth quarter of compared to due to an increase in accounts payable attributable primarily to increased volume inventory purchases and a lengthening of payment terms and to an increase in current revolving credit 
we had working capital of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
in  current assets increased by million over the prior year  with an increase of 
table of contents million in cash  an increase of million in contracts receivable and an increase of million in inventory accounting for the majority of the increase 
these increases were offset by a decrease in current deferred tax assets of million 
current liabilities increased by million for when compared to the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million in accounts payable  an million increase in current debt year over year  an increase of million in accrued estimated future contract losses and million in derivatives and warrants relating to a million convertible note issued on december our financial performance during resulted in the violation of certain bank covenants under our loan agreement during the year and at year end for which we received a waiver from our lenders 
on december  we entered into an amendment and forbearance agreement with our existing senior lending group which provided for  among other things  relief from our financial covenants through march  to allow for refinancing our debt 
at december   million was outstanding under the revolving credit line and million was outstanding under the term portion of the facility with the existing senior lending group 
on december   we entered into a securities purchase agreement the agreement with an institutional investor  pursuant to which we issued and sold to the investor a million convertible note the note and a related warrant 
the principal owing under the note is due on december  the note holder has the option to cause us to redeem up to million face amount of the note on each of june of  and the principal is payable in cash  provided  however  that if our senior credit facility would prevent such cash redemption  at our option  the principal may be repaid by converting the principal amount to be repaid into common stock at a conversion price of of the arithmetic average trading price of the common stock for a specified number of trading days prior to the scheduled principal payment date and if other specified conditions are satisfied  including compliance with nasdaq national market regulations 
we have the right to prepay the principal amount owing under the note in cash after december  if certain conditions are met  among other things that the price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price 
the note bears interest at per annum 
interest on the note is payable quarterly in cash 
the holder of the note may convert the note into common stock at any time or from time to time at per share the conversion price 
the note has a weighted average anti dilution provision that would cause an adjustment to the conversion price and the number of shares issuable under the note upon the occurrence of specified events 
the note contains restrictive covenants  including covenants that prohibit us from incurring certain indebtedness  establishing certain liens on our assets or issuing any variable priced securities 
the terms of the note require us to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis 
the covenants are substantially similar to the covenants contained in our new senior credit facility 
the note is secured by a million cash collateral account 
the cash collateral is not accessible for use by us until such time as it is released 
the cash held in the cash collateral account will be reduced as certain financial milestones are met and can be used  in part  to fund optional redemptions that may be exercised by the note holder on june of  and  or upon an event of default under the note 
the note is also secured by a security interest in our assets  subordinated only to certain senior indebtedness  including our existing credit facility with our senior lenders 
as part of the transaction  we issued to the investor a five year warrant to purchase shares of common stock exercisable for of the shares underlying the note 
the exercise price of the warrant is equal to the conversion price 
the warrant may be exercised at any time after issuance and expires december  the warrant has a weighted average anti dilution provision that would cause an adjustment to the exercise price of  and number of shares issuable under  the warrant upon the occurrence of specified events 

table of contents we are required to seek stockholder approval prior to any future issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock that would constitute a dilutive issuance under the note and warrant  with certain exceptions such as issuances of common stock under our stock option plans or in connection with any acquisition in an amount not to exceed of the outstanding shares of common stock in any twelve month period 
on february   we entered into a financing agreement the new credit facility with fortress credit corp  as administrative and collateral agent  and certain senior lenders as identified in the new credit facility 
the new credit facility provides million in revolving credit loans the revolving credit loan and a million term loan the term loan 
the revolving credit loan also provides for a letter of credit subfacility in the maximum amount of million 
the new credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the revolving credit loan will bear interest at a variable rate of to per annum plus the greater of or jpmorgan chase bank s prime rate 
interest is payable monthly 
the term loan will bear interest at the day libor rate plus a variable rate of to per annum payable monthly 
the variable rates depend on our senior secured leverage ratio 
amounts owed under the new credit facility may be accelerated under various circumstances more fully described in the new credit facility  including  but not limited to  the failure to make principal or interest payments due under the new credit facility  breaches of certain covenants  representations and warranties set forth in the new credit facility  the occurrence of certain insolvency or receivership events affecting us and certain events having a material adverse effect on our business  assets  operations or condition taken as a whole 
the new credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type  including  without limitation  restrictions on our ability to  among other things  incur debt  create liens  make investments  pay dividends  sell assets  undertake transactions with affiliates  and enter into unrelated lines of business 
in connection with the new credit facility  on february   we terminated our existing credit agreement with wells fargo  na  as administrative agent and the lenders that were parties to such agreement the prior credit facility 
we paid off all amounts borrowed and due under the prior credit facility  which aggregated approximately million 
we did not incur any penalties in connection with the termination of the prior credit facility 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in all three years  the majority of expenditures were a result of expanding production capacity at our various facilities 
we expect to expend approximately million in capital projects in the company has suffered a significant operating loss as well as negative operating cash flow in the latest fiscal year and continues to be subject to certain risks common to companies in this industry as further described in factors that could affect future results 
our financial performance for the quarter ended march  resulted in the violation of certain financial covenants within the new credit facility and  thru cross default provision  the note 
we have obtained waivers for all such covenant violations at march  and are still able to borrow under the facility 
however  we are in discussions with our lenders regarding amendments to the new credit facility in order to avoid possible future violations 
based upon our discussions  any covenant amendments to the new credit facility will be conditioned upon the closing of the financing described below 
to strengthen our financial condition we have been exploring additional financing opportunities and in this regard executed a nonbinding term sheet on june  for a private placement of equity securities in the aggregate amount of million 
pursuant to the term sheet  the investors will purchase shares of the company s common stock at per share  based on of the average closing price for may  thru june  the stock will include five year warrants to purchase additional shares equal to one half the number of shares initially sold 
the warrants will have an exercise price of per share 
we expect to close this transaction in july although we believe that we will be successful in closing the private placement and in obtaining covenant amendments  there can be no assurance that these events will occur or occur on favorable terms 

table of contents commitments and contingencies the following table represents a list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by year amounts in thousands total thereafter long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations use of estimates and critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions including those related our most critical accounting policies 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
changes in economic conditions could have an impact on these estimates and our actual results 
management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity allowances for contract adjustments we maintain allowances for contract adjustments that result from the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
management bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable  by account  at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends  and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accrual for worker s compensation reserve we are self insured for workers compensation under a high deductible program 
management bases its accrual estimate on input from the insurance carrier which includes information regarding open and closed cases  historical costs associated with those claims  certain developed costs and an estimate of incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
it is important to recognize that variation from the estimates of future liability claims is not only possible but probable 
the inherent variability may result in actual costs being either above or below the estimates recorded on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition on construction contracts contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting and  therefore  take into account the costs  estimated earnings and revenue to date on contracts not yet completed 
revenue recognized is that percentage of the total contract price that cost expended to date bears to anticipated final total cost  based on current estimates of costs to complete 
the percentage of completion methodology generally results in the recognition of reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as unbilled or deferred revenue 

table of contents any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through corporate policy  approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to project delivery  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
our estimates of revenues and costs on construction contracts change periodically in the normal course of business due to factors such as productivity and modifications of contractual arrangements 
such changes are reflected in the results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses are made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires those items be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment  a revision to statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement replaces statement no 
and supercedes apb no 
this statement addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
statement r will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we are required to adopt statement r effective january  and have two transition options under the new standard  however  the recognition of compensation expense is the same under both options 
we believe the adoption of statement r may have a material effect on our financial results during the period of adoption  however  the full effect of adopting statement r has not been determined 
seasonality historically  our quarterly revenues have been highest in the second and third quarters of each calendar year because a large number of orders for modular classrooms placed by school districts require that classrooms be constructed  delivered and installed in time for the upcoming new school year which generally commences in september 
we have typically been able to add employees as needed to respond to the corresponding increases in manufacturing output required by such seasonality to meet currently foreseeable increases in this seasonal demand 
our first and fourth quarter revenues are typically lower due to greater number of holidays and days of inclement weather during such periods 
in addition  our operating margins may vary on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of revenues between standardized classrooms and higher margin customized classrooms and the timing of the completion of large  higher margin customized contracts 
we anticipate a smoothing of this seasonality due to the growing impact of multi year contracts and increased sales outside the traditional classroom market 
however  these factors will not fully offset the impact of inclement weather and concentrations of holidays 
so although the impact of seasonality is expected to be diminished  revenue and margins in the first and fourth quarters will likely be lower than in the second and third quarters 
inflation we are subject to the effects of changing prices 
during  we realized dramatic and unprecedented increases in the price of certain commodities used in the production of our products  in particular steel  dimensional lumber 
table of contents and plywood products 
while the cost outlook for commodities used in our production is not certain  management believes it can manage these inflationary pressures with sales price adjustments as allowed by our newer contracts and by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts  including improved supply chain and inventory management 
factors that could affect future results our business is subject to a number of business risks and uncertainties that could impact the accuracy of any future looking statements in this report and cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated 
these risk and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the following losses liquidity we experienced significant operating losses in as well as negative operating cash flow for the year and may experience future operating losses and negative operating cash flow 
future losses or negative operating cash flow may adversely affect our liquidity and ability to obtain bonding 
we have been negotiating for additional financing in although we signed a non binding term sheet on june  for a private placement of common stock and warrants in the aggregate amount of million  there is no assurance that the transaction will close 
because the stock will be sold at per share  the transaction will be dilutive to existing shareholders 
availability of funding the availability of funding for new school construction and rehabilitation of existing schools by school districts is subject to financial and political considerations which vary from district to district and is not tied to demand 
in the past  the level of funding available from the states in which we do business to the school districts which are the end customers of our classrooms have caused such districts to experience budget shortfalls and to reduce their demand for our products despite growing student populations 
concentration of customers we receive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of classrooms to california school districts  to leasing companies that lease to such school districts and to a small number of independent dealers 
the loss of any one of these customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 
raw material price increases we are not always able to obtain the right in our contracts to pass through raw material price increases to our customers 
should we experience significant increases in the price of raw materials as we did in  our profitability could be adversely affected 
change in product demand prior to  the demand from school districts was mostly for standardized buildings which we were experienced in assembling in our factories 
in the last two years  the demand shifted to more complex customized buildings which required more on site work 
initially  we were not as experienced in this type of work as we were in the factory construction of standardized buildings 
in some cases  this resulted in inefficiencies on our part 
we believe we now have sufficient expertise and experience to handle the current demand for customized buildings  but should the type of buildings demanded by our customers change again  we may  for a time  experience inefficiencies that could reduce profitability 
plant closure we closed our plant in lathrop  california on april  the effect of this closure will increase our transportation costs for jobs in northern california 
this increase in costs could reduce our ability to obtain future work in northern california or to complete any jobs obtained at prior profit margins 
if we are unable to effectively integrate our former operations at lathrop into our remaining plants  it could have a material adverse 
table of contents effect on our overall operations 
additionally  if we are unable to sublease the lathrop facility for at least the rent that we remain obligated to pay through december   it will have an adverse effect on our cash flow 
low barriers in the commercial buildings market although the requirement of having state approved plans creates a barrier to entry in california in the modular school building market  no such barrier exists in the commercial and light industrial modular building industry 
the barriers in that market are relatively low  consisting primarily of capital required to develop manufacturing facilities and the availability of a qualified labor pool 
manufacturers of other modular buildings  including housing and classrooms  who possess a skilled work force and manufacturing facilities  could easily adapt their manufacturing facilities to produce modular structures 
we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the modular building market 
remediation of material weakness in internal controls our management s report on internal controls over financial reporting set forth in item a below in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act has identified certain material weaknesses in our internal controls 
we are in the process of remediating the material weaknesses 
we do not expect to complete our remediation before september if we fail to complete our remediation or if we complete the remediation but fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could prevent us from reporting our financial results in a timely and accurate basis or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
high costs of compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
our compliance efforts have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
direct costs relating to sarbanes oxley compliance were approximately  in addition to the foregoing  other risks and uncertainties that may affect our future operations are described in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission  including  without limitation  our reports on form q 
additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market factors such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  or equity prices will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of instruments 
we do not hold any financial instruments that are subject to such risks  but we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates on our current credit facility and the risk of loss on credit extended to our customers 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates on our credit facilities 
during  we did not use interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the carrying value of our prior credit facility at december  approximates fair value as the interest rate is variable and resets frequently 
indebtedness under the replacement credit facility we obtained in bears interest at libor plus additional interest of between and 
the additional interest charge is based upon certain financial ratios 
we 
table of contents estimate that the average amount of debt outstanding under the credit facility for will be million 
therefore  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of  for the year 
credit risk our credit terms generally are net for dealer accounts and defined by contracts which vary for direct sales 
we actively monitor the risk of loss through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 
historically  credit losses have been less than of sales and within our expectations
