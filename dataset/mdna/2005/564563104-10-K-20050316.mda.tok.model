item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discontinued operations and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements reflect  under the heading discontinued operations  our estimate of the net losses we expected from these operations through the date we estimated they would be disposed  and all losses expected to be realized upon the disposal of these operations 
even after the disposition of these businesses  we may continue to be exposed to some liabilities arising from their prior operations 
additionally  when we sell one of our subsidiaries  the operative contractual agreement often contains provisions that could require us to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities that arose prior to the sale date but that are discovered afterwards 
even though these liabilities are often capped  until the indemnification period expires  we may continue to be exposed to such liabilities 
our senior management is important to our customer relationships 
we believe that our success depends in part on the continued contributions of our co founder  chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer  george j 
pedersen  our president and chief operating officer  robert a 
coleman  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  ronald r 
spoehel  our senior executive vice president  eugene c 
renzi  and other members of our senior management 
we rely on our executive officers and senior management to generate business and execute programs successfully 
in addition  the relationships and reputation that members of our management team have established and maintain with government and military personnel contribute to our ability to maintain good customer relations and to identify new business opportunities 
while we have employment agreements with some of our executive officers  these agreements do not prevent them from terminating their employment 
the loss of mr 
pedersen  mr 
coleman  mr 
spoehel  and mr 
renzi or any other senior management personnel could impair our ability to identify and secure new contracts and otherwise to manage our business 
we must recruit and retain skilled employees to succeed in our labor intensive business 
to be competitive  we must have employees who have advanced information technology and technical services skills and who work well with our customers in a government or defense related environment 
these employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of these employees  our ability to maintain and grow our business could be negatively impacted 
in addition  some of our contracts contain provisions requiring us to commit to staff a program with certain personnel the customer considers key to our successful performance under the contract 
in the event we are unable to provide these key personnel or acceptable substitutions  the customer may terminate the contract  and we may not be able to recover certain incurred costs 
our business is dependent upon obtaining and maintaining required security clearances 
many of our federal government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances  and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances complying with department of defense requirements 
obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process  and it is difficult to identify  recruit and retain employees who already hold security clearances 
if our employees are unable to obtain or retain security clearances or if our employees who hold security clearances terminate employment with us  the customer whose work requires cleared employees could terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration 
in addition  we expect that many of the contracts on which we will bid will require us to demonstrate our ability to obtain facility security clearances and perform work with employees who hold specified types of security clearances 
to the extent we are not able to obtain facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract  we may not be able to bid on or win new contracts  or effectively rebid on expiring contracts 
we may be affected by intellectual property infringement claims 
we are and may in the future be subject to claims from our employees or third parties who assert that software solutions and other forms of intellectual property that we used in delivering services and solutions to our customers infringe upon intellectual property rights of such employees or third parties 
if our vendors  our employees or third parties assert claims that we or our customers are infringing on their intellectual property  we could incur substantial costs to defend these claims 
in addition  if any of these infringement claims are ultimately successful  we could be required to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology  obtain a license or additional licenses  or redesign our products and services that rely on the challenged software or technology 
covenants in our credit facility may restrict our financial and operating flexibility 
on february   we executed an amended and restated credit and security agreement with citizens bank of pennsylvania  keybank national association  branch banking and trust company of virginia  chevy chase bank  fsb  and riggs bank  fsb  in order to increase the capacity available under our prior loan agreement 
the agreement initially provides for a million revolving credit facility that can be increased to million 
the maturity date of the agreement is february  our credit facility contains covenants that limit or restrict our ability to borrow additional money  merge or consolidate  sell or dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business  make acquisitions  enter into related party transactions  pay dividends  and make certain capital expenditures 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial covenants relating to asset coverage  fixed charge coverage  and debt coverage ratios 
our ability to satisfy these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet these ratios 
default under our credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets  including the stock of certain of our subsidiaries  to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if the lenders declare amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be due  the lenders could proceed against those assets 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business if the creditors determine to exercise their rights 
we also may incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility  restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or subject us to other events of default 
from time to time we may require consents or waivers from our lenders to permit actions that are prohibited by our credit facility 
if in the future our lenders refuse to provide waivers of our credit facility s restrictive covenants and or financial ratios  then we may be in default under our credit facility  and we may be prohibited from undertaking actions that are necessary or desirable to maintain and expand our business 
our employees or subcontractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities 
while we have ethics and compliance programs in place  we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur 
in addition  from time to time we enter into arrangements with subcontractors and joint venture partners to bid on and execute particular contracts or programs  as a result  we are exposed to the risk that fraud or other misconduct or improper activities by such persons may occur 
misconduct by employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could include intentional failures to comply with federal laws  federal government procurement regulations or the terms of contracts that we receive  or failures to disclose unauthorized or unsuccessful activities to us 
these actions could lead to civil  criminal  and or administrative penalties including fines  imprisonment  suspension and or debarment from performing federal government contracts and harm our reputation 
misconduct by our employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could also involve the improper collection  handling or use of our customers sensitive or classified information  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation 
we have from time to time experienced occurrences of misconduct and improper activities by our employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners 
it is not always possible to deter misconduct by our employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners 
under certain circumstances  conduct of our employees can be imputed to the mantech subsidiary for which they work and the conduct of mantech subsidiaries can be imputed to mantech international corporation with the consequence that mantech international corporation could be subject to sanctions and penalties for actions taken by our subsidiaries and or the employees of our subsidiaries 
the precautions we take to prevent and detect such activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses  and such misconduct by employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could result in serious civil or criminal penalties or sanctions or harm to our reputation 
item properties our facilities are leased in close proximity to our customers 
since  we have leased our corporate headquarters office building in fairfax  virginia 
the lease on this facility expires in march as of december   we leased additional operating facilities throughout the metropolitan washington  dc area and facilities in other parts of the united states 
we also have employees working at customer sites throughout the united states and in other countries 
the following table provides information concerning certain of our leased properties 
none of our leases is material to our business

lease expiration dates range from years through item legal proceedings we are subject to certain legal proceedings  government audits  investigations  claims and disputes that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
like most large government defense contractors  our contract costs are audited and reviewed on a continual basis by an in house staff of auditors from the defense contract auditing agency 
in addition to these routine audits  we are subject from time to time to audits and investigations by other agencies of the federal government 
these audits and investigations are conducted to determine if our performance and administration of our government contracts are compliant with contractual requirements and applicable federal statutes and regulations 
an audit or investigation may result in a finding that our performance  systems and administration is compliant or  alternatively  may result in the government initiating proceedings against us or our employees  including administrative proceedings seeking repayment of monies  suspension and or debarment from doing business with the federal government or a particular agency  or civil or criminal proceedings seeking penalties and or fines 
audits and investigations conducted by the federal government frequently span several years

as of march   there were twenty six holders of record of our class a common stock and four holders of record of our class b common stock 
the number of holders of record of our class a common stock is not representative of the number of beneficial holders because many of the shares are held by depositories  brokers or nominees 
dividend policy currently  we intend to retain any earnings for the future operation and growth of our business 
in addition  our credit facility restricts us from paying cash dividends to holders of our common stock 
as a result  we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
no dividends have been declared on any class of our common stock since our initial public offering in any future dividends declared would be at the discretion of our board of directors and would depend  among other factors  upon our results of operations  financial condition and cash requirements  and the terms of our credit facility and other financing agreements at the time such payment is considered

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
this discussion addresses only our continuing operations  except in the discussion under the heading  discontinued operations 
for more information on our discontinued operations  please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a leading provider of innovative technologies and solutions for mission critical national security programs for the intelligence community and the departments of defense  state  homeland security  justice and other us federal government agencies 
our expertise includes systems engineering  systems integration  software development  enterprise security architecture  information assurance  intelligence operations support  network and critical infrastructure protection  information technology  communications integration and engineering support 
with more than  highly qualified employees  we operate in the united states and countries worldwide 
we derive revenue primarily from contracts with us government agencies that are focused on national security and as a result  funding for our programs are generally linked to trends in us government spending in the areas of defense  intelligence and homeland security 
leading up to and following the terrorist events of september   the us government substantially increased its overall defense  intelligence and homeland security budgets 
in  our revenue increased mainly as a result of the expansion of our work with intelligence agencies in us  efforts involving telecommunications  infrastructure  maintenance  repair and sustainment support provided in military deployed environments with us and allied forces in support of peace keeping efforts worldwide  support to the state department  and the acquisitions that occurred in the past two years  including the two operations from acs in these increases in were partly offset by million reduction in our msm security services revenue primarily related to our contract with defense security services 
during the second quarter of  we faced challenges associated with our personnel security investigations psi business at our mantech msm security services  inc msm subsidiary 
the psi business had been a small part of mantech s operations for several years when the us government accountability office reported in that the backlog of security clearances in the us was in the range of  and becoming a critical national problem 
in january  we were awarded a million contract by dss to perform background investigations 
shortly thereafter  we acquired msm security services  inc  our joint venture partner on the dss contract 
when the dss contract started we were processing approximately clearances per day 
dss then asked us to increase our capability to plus cases per day 
we significantly expanded our internal staff from approximately personnel to over  and investigative staff from approximately  to approximately  in response to that request 
additionally  we invested in software management tools necessary to support those operations 
in mid  the government announced that dss would merge with another government agency  the office of personnel management opm on october  this merger did not take place until february  but dss  nonetheless  in stopped providing new cases 
the government s decision to stop providing new cases impacted us in two ways 
first  the reduced volume of business over the remaining term of the contract no longer supported the expansion of the staff and facilities 
second  it changed the characteristics of the cases from a blend of easy and hard cases to far more hard cases that were significantly more complex than anticipated  requiring substantially more work to complete than our prior experience indicated 
the changes in the government s organization and posture and associated merger delays  as well as the increased costs associated with this fixed priced contract  reduced our earnings and resulted in an operating loss in our msm operation of million 
on october   we delivered all remaining cases on the dss contract and in we collected all remaining receivables 
on february   we reached a final corporate determination to exit the psi business and discontinue operations of the msm subsidiary 
we reached the determination to sell our msm business after we concluded that the msm business no longer furthered our long term strategic objectives 
currently  we intend to sell msm as a going concern  and are in the process of identifying potential buyers 
we expect to complete the sale or other disposition of the msm operations by the end of the following table presents certain operational performance measures for our msm subsidiary  our other businesses ie  excluding msm  and mantech on a consolidated basis 
this information provides additional insight into the impact of msm s performance on mantech s consolidated results for the years ended december  and december  in thousands 
for the year ended december  msm other operations mantech consolidated revenues operating loss income operating margin net loss income for the year ended december  msm other operations mantech consolidated revenues operating income loss operating margin net income loss results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for this increase is largely attributable to several factors  including revenue million from the acquisition of operations from acs in the first and second quarters of  a full year versus ten months revenue million from integrated data systems ids  which was acquired in early  revenue million as a result of our expansion of the logistical readiness  telecommunications  infrastructure  maintenance  repair and sustainment support provided in military deployed environments with us and allied forces in support of peace keeping efforts worldwide  revenue million from additional work under contracts that were in existence during the prior year  revenue million as a result of operations related to information technology forensics and intrusion  and revenue million from our contract to support relocation of a us army special operations command center 
the total increase attributable to the factors described above is million 
the remaining amount of increase  million  is due to increased work from department of defense and various intelligence agencies 
offsetting these increases was a million decrease in revenue from msm operations 
the increase in revenue from our operations excluding msm was million  which accounted for a growth in revenue from to we derived approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  from work under gsa schedule contracts  compared with approximately for we derived approximately of our revenues for from contracts in which we acted as a subcontractor  compared with approximately for cost of services cost of services increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for as a percentage of revenues  cost of services increased from to 
the increase by is primarily due to the million decrease in revenues at msm and an million increase in cost of services at msm  which includes the million contract loss recorded in the second quarter of excluding msm  cost of services as a percentage of revenue remained the same at for both and out of the million increase in cost of services  over million is attributable to cost incurred on operations purchased from acs during the first and second quarters of direct labor costs increased from million to million  or  due to an increase in personnel  increased salaries and increased benefit costs 
for the year ended december   other direct costs increased from million to million  or  over the year ended december  direct labor costs excluding msm increased by due to an increase in personnel  primarily related to our acquisitions  direct new hires and increased salaries 
as a percentage of revenues  other direct costs increased to for the year ended december   from for the same period in  due to increased pass through sales 
for the year ended december   other direct costs including msm increased by over the twelve months of  from million to million 
this increase was attributable to an increase in pass through costs in over  the million contract loss noted above  year to date results from ids  and costs incurred on contracts purchased from acs 
as a percentage of revenues  other direct costs including msm increased to for the year ended december   from for the same period in gross profit gross profit decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of revenues  gross profit margin decreased to for the year ended december   compared to earned for the same period in the decrease in the gross profit margin was primarily the result of the million decrease in revenues at msm and an million increase in cost of services  noted above 
the gross profit of our operations other than our msm operations remained relatively constant  at to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for as a result of additional management personnel and infrastructure to support the growth of our business 
in addition  we recorded million in costs related to terminating a lease agreement for an idle facility and million in costs related to close one of the offices located in our washington dc area 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses remain relatively constant at and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the increase resulted primarily from an additional million of amortization of intangible assets established in connection with our recent acquisitions and an additional million of depreciation expense from additional fixed assets placed in operation as a result of our operational growth 
income from operations income from operations decreased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the decrease was primarily a result of the losses at msm  noted above 
income from operations excluding msm increased from to and this increase is aligned with the increase in revenue generated from our operations other than msm 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for  mainly as a result of loss from msm operations described above 
income from continuing operations excluding msm increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for this increase is attributable to several factors  including a full twelve months of revenues from the aegis and ctx businesses that were acquired in august and december  respectively  ten months of revenues from the company s ids and msm acquisitions  additional work under contracts that were in existence during the prior year  and the us army communications electronics command cecom contract  which did not start until the second quarter of the company derived approximately of its revenues for the year ended december  from work under gsa schedule contracts  compared with approximately for the company derived approximately of its revenues for from contracts in which it acted as a subcontractor  compared with approximately for cost of services cost of services increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for as a percentage of revenues  cost of services decreased from to 
direct labor costs increased from million to million  or  due to an increase in personnel  primarily related to the approximately  personnel added in connection with the company s four recent acquisitions 
for the year ended december   other direct costs increased from million to million  or  over the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  other direct costs increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in due to increased pass through sales 
for the year ended december   overhead personnel and facilities costs decreased  as a percentage of revenues  compared with the same period in  due to operating efficiencies 
gross profit gross profit increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of revenues  gross profit margin increased to for the year ended december   which represents a slight improvement from the earned for the same period in this improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily the result of an increase in revenues generated under time and materials and fixed price contracts 
time and materials and fixed price contracts comprised of revenues for the year ended december   compared with of revenues for the year ended december  general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for due to additional management personnel and infrastructure to support the growth of the company s business 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily as a result of operating efficiencies 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense has increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase resulted from an additional million of amortization of intangible assets established in connection with the company s four recent acquisitions  as well as million of additional depreciation expense and million of additional capitalized software amortization expense  offset by a million decrease in the amortization of not to compete financings 
income from operations income from operations increased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the increase was primarily a result of the increase in revenues relative to the cost of services discussed above 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase resulted from million of additional operating income  offset by increases in income tax expense of million  interest expense of million and other expense of million 
while the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  of was consistent with the effective tax rate for the same period in  interest expense was lower in as the company had excess cash on hand from its initial public offering  which was used in the third and fourth quarters of to fund two of the company s acquisitions 
the increase in other expense in was primarily the result of losses incurred by a company affiliate accounted for under the equity method of accounting  offset by income from a separate company affiliate and other income related to realized gains on foreign currency transactions 
backlog for the years ended  and our backlog was billion  billion  and billion respectively  of which million  million  and million  respectively  was funded backlog 
backlog and funded backlog represent estimates that we calculate on a consistent basis 
we estimate that approximately to of the total backlog will be recognized as revenues prior to december  liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and our million revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had an outstanding balance of million under our credit facility 
generally  cash provided by operating activities is adequate to fund our operations 
we maintain a million outstanding loan balance  related to our interest rate swap agreements  which has a fixed rate of 
in addition  due to fluctuations in our cash flows and the growth in our operations  it is necessary from time to time to borrow above the million level 
in the future  we may borrow greater amounts in order to finance acquisitions or new contract start ups 
in  we used proceeds of million from our follow on public offering in to fund our acquisitions and related expenses of ids and msm the following table sets forth cash provided used by operating activities of continuing operations for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities of continuing operations cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million of cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  the increase is primarily as a result of improvement in billing and collection processes of newly acquired subsidiaries contracts receivables and an increase in accrued liabilities 
in  cash used in operating activities was primarily as a result of increases in contract receivables of million and prepaid expenses and other assets of million  offset by net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and increases in deferred income taxes  accounts payable and accrued expenses  and salary related accruals 
in  cash provided by operating activities was generated primarily from net income of million and increases in accounts payable and accruals  offset by an increase in contract receivables and a decrease in deferred income taxes

cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was million for the year ended december   which was primarily the result of the net proceeds of our initial and follow on public offerings of million and million  respectively  less amounts used to repay debt 
credit agreement on february   we executed an amended and restated credit and security agreement with citizens bank of pennsylvania  keybank national association  branch banking and trust company of virginia  chevy chase bank  fsb  and riggs bank  fsb  in order to increase the capacity available under our prior loan agreement 
the agreement initially provides for a million revolving credit facility that can be increased to million

borrowings under the agreement are collateralized by our assets and bear interest at the london inter bank offer rate libor  or the lender s base rate  plus market rate spreads that are determined based on a company leverage ratio calculation 
to manage our exposure to the fluctuations in these variable interest rates  we executed an interest swap in december the swap agreement has a notional principal amount of million and currently has a fixed libor rate of 
as of december   we were in compliance with all material covenants under the credit agreement 
we believe the capital resources available to us under our credit agreements and cash from our operations are adequate to fund our ongoing operations and to support the internal growth we expect to achieve for at least the next months

critical accounting estimates and policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  including the critical policies listed below  are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition and cost estimation we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have a standard internal process that we use to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
our revenues consist primarily of services provided by our employees  and to a lesser extent  the pass through of costs for materials and subcontract efforts under contracts with our customers 
cost of services consists primarily of compensation expenses for program personnel  the fringe benefits associated with this compensation  and other direct expenses incurred to complete programs  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
we derive the majority of our revenue from cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  firm fixed price  or time and materials contracts 
revenues for cost reimbursement contracts are recorded as reimbursable costs are incurred  including a pro rata share of the contractual fees 
for time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
for long term fixed price production contracts  revenue is recognized at a rate per unit as the units are delivered  or by other methods to measure services provided 
revenue from other long term fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate methods to measure services provided 
contract costs are expensed as incurred except for certain limited long term contracts noted below 
for long term contracts which are specifically described in the scope section of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  or other appropriate accounting literature we apply the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  income is recognized at a consistent profit margin over the period of performance based on estimated profit margins at completion of the contract 
this method of accounting requires estimating the total revenues and total contract cost at completion of the contract 
during the performance of long term contracts  these estimates are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
the impact on revenue and contract profit as a result of these revisions is included in the periods in which the revisions are made 
this method can result in the deferral of costs or the deferral of profit on these contracts 
because we assume the risk of performing a fixed price contract at a set price  the failure to accurately estimate ultimate costs or to control costs during performance of the work could result  and in some instances has resulted  in reduced profits or losses for such contracts 
estimated losses on contracts at completion are recognized when identified 
in certain circumstances  revenues are recognized when contract amendments have not been finalized

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
these borrowings bear interest at variable rates 
during the first quarter of  we repaid all but million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our annual interest expense for the year ended december  by less than million
