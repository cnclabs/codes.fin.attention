item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have developed a broad line of pre programmed universal wireless control products and audio video accessories that are marketed to enhance home entertainment systems 
our channels of distribution include international retail  us retail  private label  oems  cable and satellite service providers  and companies in the computing industry 
we believe that our universal remote control database is capable of controlling virtually all infrared remote ir controlled tvs  vcrs  dvd players  cable converters  cd players  audio components and satellite receivers  as well as most other infrared remote controlled devices worldwide 
beginning in and continuing today  we have compiled an extensive library of over  ir codes that cover nearly  individual device functions and over  individual consumer electronic equipment brand names 
our library is regularly updated with new ir codes used in newly introduced video and audio devices 
all such ir codes are captured from the original manufacturer s remote control devices or manufacturer s specifications to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the database 
we have also developed patented technologies that provide the capability to easily upgrade the memory of the wireless control device by adding ir codes from the library that were not originally included 
beginning in  we began selling our nevo software embedded on our chip to a third party supplier of personal digital assistant devices pdas 
nevo was launched in july of building on this platform  we expect to use nevo technology in a new product named nevo sl which we expect to ship in the second quarter of nevo sl is a universal controller that delivers complete audio  visual and wi fi digital media control for the networked home 
from october  through december   we acquired over of the outstanding shares of simpledevices  inc simpledevices for approximately million in cash  including direct acquisition costs  plus a performance based payment of our unregistered common stock to be paid in the future if certain financial objectives are achieved  which has not been reflected as part of the purchase price as of december  since it is not probable that the performance metrics will be met 
the value we received from this acquisition relates primarily to simpledevices unique capabilities  as well as their complete and in process technology 
simpledevices has developed connected device technology solutions that link the home computer and the internet to existing consumer electronic devices in the home and car 
the company provides universal plug and play upnp compatible software to transform common home devices into connected devices that is  allow them to find  control and share entertainment media across a home network 
upnp is an architecture for pervasive peer to peer network connectivity of intelligent appliances  wireless devices  and pcs of all form factors 
it is designed to bring standards based connectivity to ad hoc or unmanaged networks whether in the home  in a small business  public spaces  or attached to the internet 
upnp is a distributed  open networking architecture that leverages tcp ip and the web technologies to enable seamless proximity networking in addition to control and data transfer among networked devices in the home  office  and public spaces 
the following is a description of the significant research and development projects that were under development at the acquisition date which comprised the aggregate ipr d charge of  simpleware tm platforms simpleware tm platforms include simplecenter tm  simpledevice tm  and simplesync tm 
these platforms are core software products for simpledevices  inc these platforms provide flexible  standards based software development kits and applications 
the development kits enable oems to create customized device applications for different market demographics 
simpleware tm platform products and services include connected device software  media server solutions  usb hardware 
table of contents reference designs  and content service solutions 
the simpleware tm platforms had been introduced into the market  were generating revenue  and had reached technological feasibility at the date of the acquisition  and were classified as core developed technology 
the ipr d related to simpleware tm platforms includes research and development efforts underway to significantly enhance certain features of this software 
the associated ipr d charge for this technology is  simpeware extensions simpleware tm extensions include mediashare  mediaskins  mediaprovisioning  mediaexplorer  digital rights management  and ripping 
simpleware tm extensions are add ons to the core software products  simpleware tm platforms 
the ipr d related to simpleware tm extensions includes research and development efforts underway to significantly enhance certain features of these add ons 
the associated ipr d charge for this technology is  basis for in process r d valuation assumptions as noted above  the projects in development as of the acquisition date are expected to reach technological feasibility over a period of approximately six to twelve months subsequent to the acquisition date 
cash flows from the sale of software incorporating these technologies are expected to extend through the year and are forecasted using a product life cycle approach 
factors considered in estimating cash flows include historical margin levels  budgeted margin levels  the migration of the acquired core developed technology through subsequent advancements  the estimated life of the underlying technologies in each of the products  and the value contribution estimated to be associated with the technology and industry norms 
in general  the estimated margins utilized in the valuation are reflective of the margins historically realized by simpledevices 
also reflective of historical experience  the margins are expected to increase over the product life cycle 
the expectation for future selling  general and administrative expenses likewise are reflective of historical experience and the assumptions used in simpledevices enterprise valuation model 
research and development costs were forecasted for each ipr d project based upon the costs required to bring the product to fruition and the additional costs associated with maintaining the product technology 
the expected operating margins for the ipr d were reduced for contributory assets  including assessments for capital expenditures and working capital employed  as well as a return on both the tangible assets and the identified intangibles valued in the purchase price allocation 
the free cash flows net of the various charges discussed above generated by the in process technologies in future periods were discounted to their net present value by applying a reasonable discount rate 
the discount rate applied to the individual technologies was 
this discount rate reflects a risk premium of over the weighted average cost of capital wacc of computed for simpledevices 
the wacc was determined based upon an analysis that considered selected industry data 
the wacc represents a blended  after tax cost of debt and equity  and was calculated using a capital asset pricing model 
through the date of this report  there have been no events or changes in circumstances that suggest the assumptions used in the valuation of the ipr d were not reasonable 
simpledevices has continued its development of the in process technologies and anticipates deploying these technologies in end products in a timeframe and manner consistent with the projections used for valuation purposes 
identifiable intangibles and goodwill as discussed above  a portion of the simpledevices purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
goodwill has an assigned value of approximately million 
the identifiable intangibles consist of core developed technology  engineering service agreements and trademarks and trade names 
as with the ipr d  the values of these assets were determined using a future income approach  in context of the business enterprise value of simpledevices 
the trademark and trade name assets were assigned values as of the acquisition date of approximately  these assets will be amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of years 
the core developed technology and engineering service agreements assets were assigned values as of the acquisition date of approximately  and  respectively 
these assets will be amortized on a straight line 
table of contents basis over their estimated useful lives of years 
the matters discussed in this annual report on form k should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report 
certain statements contained herein may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  as discussed more fully herein 
see factors that may affect financial condition and future results in this form k 
in addition  more information about risk factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in the section entitled factors that may affect financial condition and future results below 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  warranties  inventory valuation  business combination purchase price allocations  review for impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  and income taxes 
actual results may differ from the estimates 
these estimates may be adjusted as more information becomes available and any adjustment could be significant 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on the sale of products and services when delivery has occurred title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
the provision for sales returns requires significant estimates and judgment 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
the provision recorded for estimated sales returns and allowances is deducted from gross sales to arrive at net sales in the period the related revenue is recorded 
sales allowances reduce gross accounts receivable to arrive at accounts receivable  net in the same period the related receivable is recorded 
we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method which requires significant judgment and estimates by management as to the extent of progress towards completion of the contract 
when applying the percentage of completion method  we rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue and labor hours 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and labor applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions to revenue and profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known and losses are accrued when identified 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivables and historical bad debts  customer credit  current economic trends and changes in customer payment trends when evaluating the 
table of contents adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventories consist of wireless control devices  including universal remote controls  wireless keyboards  antennas  and related component parts including integrated circuits and are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we carry inventory in amounts necessary to satisfy certain of our customers inventory requirements on a timely basis 
new product innovations and technological advances may shorten a given product s life cycle 
we continually monitor the inventory status to control inventory levels and dispose of any excess or obsolete inventories on hand 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon our best estimates about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
business combinations 
we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
the total purchase price of simpledevices  which was approximately million  including direct acquisition costs  has been allocated to the net assets acquired based on estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by us include customer contracts  developed and core technology and trade names 
the fair values assigned to the identified intangible assets are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in item critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed  brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
valuation of long lived assets and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a significant variance between our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  and based on the carrying value of the asset being more than the undiscounted cash flows  we measure an impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in assessing the recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of december of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of 
table of contents each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows for that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing expenses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we must provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for tax liabilities involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
in situations involving tax related uncertainties  we provide for deferred tax liabilities when we believe such liabilities are probable 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of compared to million for the same period last year 
net income for was million or per share basic and per 
table of contents share diluted compared to million or per share basic and per share diluted for net sales in our business lines subscription broadcasting  oem  and computing companies were approximately of net sales for compared to for net sales in our business lines for increased by to million from million in net sales to subscription broadcasting service providers and oems for increased by to million from million in the increase in sales resulted from an increase in the volume of remote control sales  which was partially offset by lower prices 
the increase in volume was attributable to the continued deployment of advanced function set top boxes by the service operators 
these advanced functions include personal video recording pvr  video on demand vod  and high definition hd television 
we expect that the deployment of advanced function set top boxes by the service operators will continue into the foreseeable future as penetration for each of the functions cited continues to increase 
net sales in our consumer lines one for all international retail  private label  and direct import accounted for approximately of net sales for compared to for our net sales for from our consumer lines were million  an increase of from net sales of million in of this increase  the one for all international retail sales for increased by to million from million in about million of this increase was related to favorable foreign exchange rate movements  as both the euro and british pound strengthened compared to the us dollar 
the remaining improvement in international retail sales was due to an increase in sales of our sky branded digital accessories  one for all remote controls  and audio video accessories 
private label sales for decreased by to million from million in due to a decline in the volume of kameleon sales 
united states direct import licensing and product revenues for decreased by to million from million in due to a decline in the volume of kameleon sales 
we expect that sales in our consumer lines will continue to be driven by strength in international retail sales 
gross profit for was million compared to million for gross profit as a percent of sales for was compared to for the increase is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the euro and british pound compared to the us dollar  which resulted in an increase of approximately million profit and added to the gross profit rate 
this increase was partially offset by increased inventory write downs of million which contributed to a reduction in the gross profit rate 
in addition  the increase in gross profit rate was partially offset by oem sales  which generally have a lower gross profit rate  being a larger percentage of our total business 
we expect gross profit rates to remain near recent levels in research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase is related to our continued expansion of the nevo platform  and the development of audio video accessories for sale in our retail channel 
in addition  ipr d of million related to the simpledevices acquisition was expensed in the fourth quarter of we expect research and development expense to continue an upward trend in selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  million to appreciation of the euro relative to the us dollar  million to increased performance based employee bonuses  million to the acquisition of simpledevices  million to freight costs  and million to non sarbanes oxley related professional services costs 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase from levels during due in part to the full year impact of simpledevices and an increase in variable expenses related to increased sales volume 
in  we recorded million of interest income compared to million for this increase is due to higher money market rates in europe  an investment in a certificate of deposit  and a higher average cash balance 
in  other expense  net was million as compared to million of other income  net for approximately million of expense was the result of our write down of an investment in a private company  and million of expense resulted from foreign currency exchange losses 
the results for included a foreign currency exchange gain of million 

table of contents we recorded income tax expense of million in compared to million in our estimated effective tax rate was in  and in we expect that our tax rate will rise in to around as a larger percentage of profits are earned in higher tax rate countries 
simpledevices  inc transaction we accounted for the acquisition of simpledevices by the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  we allocated the purchase price of the acquisition based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
significant portions of the simpledevices purchase price were identified as intangible assets 
we employed valuation techniques which reflect guidance from the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid series entitled assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities a focus on software  electronic devices  and pharmaceutical industries on approaches and procedures to be followed in developing allocations to acquired in process research and development ipr d 
the final purchase price allocation includes our identification of thousand of ipr d 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value  based upon risk adjusted cash flows  of simpledevices ipr d projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the ipr d had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  we expensed these costs as research and development in the quarter ended december  the remaining simpledevices purchase premium was allocated to identifiable intangibles  which are being amortized over various periods ranging from to years  as well as goodwill 
simpledevices recorded net sales of million and a pretax loss of million during the period between october  acquisition date and december  sales consisted primarily of engineering services related to the development of hardware utilized by simpledevices customers to run the simpleplatforms software 
in addition  simpledevices also generated revenue customizing their software products to customer s specific needs 
sales attributable to simpledevices are included in our business category when we discuss consolidated results 
the results of simpledevices have been included since the date of acquisition and are described below 
gross profit was million  or of sales 
research and development expenses were million  which represents the expensing of in process technology as a result of the acquisition 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses were million  which consisted primarily of engineering payroll and benefits costs 
we anticipate that sales generated as a result of software customization and engineering services will begin to decline as a percent of total sales as software licensing fees and the associated maintenance fees begin to increase 
we also anticipate that gross profit and gross profit as a percent of sales will increase as this shift occurs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of over the net sales of million for the same period last year 
net income for was million or per share basic and per share diluted compared to million or per share basic and per share diluted for net sales in our business lines subscription broadcasting and oem increased by million  or  to million in from million in net sales to subscription broadcasting service providers and oems increased by million  or  to million in from million in direct and oem sales to subscription broadcasting service providers in the united states and in europe  where additional geographic penetration was achieved  accounted for a significant portion of the increase 
net sales in the business lines were approximately of net sales in compared to in net sales from the consumer lines one for all international retail  private label  and direct import increased million  or  to million in from million in of this increase  the one for all international retail sales increased million  or  to million in from million in reasons for the increase included sky branded retail products sold in the uk  kameleon sales particularly in germany and spain and appreciation of the euro relative to the us dollar 
private label sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in due to the success of the kameleon product line which was introduced in late united states direct import licensing and product revenues increased by million or to million in from million in due to the success of the kameleon product line which was introduced into this channel in early net sales in the consumer lines accounted for approximately of total net sales compared to in gross profit was million or of net sales in as compared to million or of net sales in gross profit as a percent of sales in was lower primarily due to price pressure in the subscription broadcasting service line  which resulted from consolidation within the industry 
other factors contributing to the decline in the gross profit percentage included changes in mix and inventory write downs which included million related to the mosaic product line in the fourth quarter of research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to general cost increases 
resources have been realigned from core technology to advanced technology products  thus allowing a greater investment in future products while holding overall expenses relatively constant 
total research and development expenditures are expected to increase more significantly in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in of this increase  million was attributable to increased employee bonuses 
other increases were related to the appreciation of the euro relative to the us dollar and costs associated with changes in staffing such as  severance  recruiting  and relocation 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in as a result of the cost of compliance with the sarbanes oxley requirements 
other income  net increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to an increase in the gain on foreign currency transactions of million offset by a patent settlement of million that occurred in income tax expense increased to million in from million in the increase in the effective tax rate to in from in is primarily related to a decrease in research and development credits in as compared to 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds are from operations 
cash provided by operating activities for was million as compared to million in the decrease in cash flow from operations is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable as well as accrued expenses increasing by a lesser amount in as compared to offset partially by the increase in net income 
on october   we acquired simpledevices for approximately million in cash including direct acquisition costs  plus a potential performance based payment of our unregistered common stock to be paid in the future if certain future financial objectives are achieved  which has not been reflected as part of the purchase price as of december  since it is not probable the objectives will be met 
capital expenditures in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
annual capital expenditures relate primarily to acquiring product tooling each year 
we are currently evaluating our existing and future information system requirements  and may make a significant investment to upgrade our systems in during the second quarter of  we completed an acquisition of certain multimedia protocol technologies from a software development company for million 
these technologies enable custom wireless control solutions for home entertainment hardware and software applications 
in september   we terminated our million unsecured revolving credit agreement with bank of america national trust and savings association 
on september   we entered into a three year million unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit facility with comerica bank comerica 
under the credit facility with comerica  the interest payable is variable and is based on the bank s cost of funds or the libor rate plus a fixed margin of 
the interest rate in effect as of december  using the libor rate option plus a fixed margin of was 
we pay a commitment fee ranging from zero to a maximum rate of of per year on the unused portion of the credit line depending on the amount of cash investment retained with comerica during each quarter 
under the terms of this credit facility  dividend payments are allowed up to of net income of the prior fiscal year period to be paid within days of such prior year  and we are subject to certain financial covenants related to our net worth  quick ratio  and net income 
amounts available for borrowing under this credit facility are reduced by the outstanding balance of import letters of credit 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility and no outstanding import letters of credit 
furthermore  as of december   we are in compliance with all financial covenants required by the credit facility 
in we purchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of  we purchased  and  shares of our common stock in open market purchases in and  respectively  at a cost of  and  respectively 
we hold these shares as treasury stock  and they are available for reissue by us 
presently  except for using a small number of these treasury shares to compensate our outside board members  we have no plans to distribute these shares  although we may change these plans if necessary to fulfill our on going business objectives 
we have authority under the credit facility to acquire up to  shares of our common stock in market purchases 
between the date of execution of the credit facility and december   we have purchased  shares of our common stock leaving  remaining shares authorized for purchase under the credit facility 
in we may continue to purchase shares of our common stock if conditions are favorable 
during  we received proceeds of approximately  from the exercise of stock options granted to our employees  as compared to approximately  and  during and  respectively 

table of contents historically  our working capital needs have typically been greatest during the third and fourth quarters when accounts receivable and inventories increase in connection with the fourth quarter holiday selling season 
at december   we had million of working capital as compared to at december  the decrease in working capital during these periods is principally due to the cash purchase of simpledevices 
the following summarizes our obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period december  in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other obligations total at december   we did not have any bank guarantees that provide for payment by the bank to our suppliers in the event of non payment for transactions with suppliers in the ordinary course of business 
it is our policy to carefully monitor the state of our business  cash requirements  and capital structure 
we believe that funds generated from our operations and available from our borrowing facility will be sufficient to fund current business operations as well as anticipated growth at least through the end of  however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be adequate for that purpose 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes new standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and we are required to adopt this standard in the fourth quarter of  beginning on november  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect sfas will have a material impact 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june  and we are required to adopt the standard in the fourth quarter of  beginning on november  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect it will have a material impact 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r requires companies to expense the value of stock options and similar awards 
this statement is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
sfas r will significantly change existing accounting practice and will have a material effect on our reported earnings 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim period that begins after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in our third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas factors that may affect financial condition and future results forward looking statements we caution that the following important factors  among others including but not limited to factors discussed below or above in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  or in our other reports filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  could affect our actual results and could contribute to or cause our actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements

table of contents markets to continue growing and expanding in the manner we anticipated  the failure of our customers to grow and expand as we anticipated  the effects of natural or other events beyond our control  including the effect a war or terrorist activities may have on the company or the economy  the economic environment s effect on us and our customers  the growth of  acceptance of and the demand for our products and technologies in various markets and geographical regions  including cable  satellite  consumer electronics  retail and interactive tv and home automation  not materializing as we believed  our inability to add profitable complementary products which are accepted by the marketplace  our inability to continue to maintain our operating costs at acceptable levels through our cost containment efforts  our inability to realize tax benefits from various tax projects initiated from time to time  our inability to maintain the strength of our balance sheet  our inability to continue selling our products or licensing our technologies at higher or profitable margins  the failure of the various markets and industries to grow or emerge as rapidly or as successfully as we believed  the lack of continued growth of our technologies and product lines addressing the market for digital media  our inability to obtain orders or maintain our order volume with new and existing customers  the possible dilutive effect our stock option program may have on our earnings per share and stock price  our inability to continue to obtain adequate quantities of component parts or secure adequate factory production capacity on a timely basis  and other factors listed from time to time in our press releases and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
dependence upon key suppliers most of the components used in our products are available from multiple sources  however  we have elected to purchase integrated circuit components used in our products  principally our wireless control products  and certain other components used in our products  from two main sources  each of which provides in excess of ten percent of the microprocessors used in our products 
we have identified alternative sources of supply for these integrated circuit components 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain these components on a timely basis 
we generally maintain some inventories of our integrated chips  which could be used in part to mitigate  but not eliminate  delays resulting from supply interruptions 
an extended interruption  shortage or termination in the supply of any of the components used in our products  or a reduction in their quality or reliability  or a significant increase in prices of components  would have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and cash flows 
dependence on foreign manufacturing third party manufacturers located in foreign countries manufacture a majority of our wireless controls 
our arrangements with our foreign manufacturers are subject to the risks of doing business abroad  such as import duties  trade restrictions  work stoppages  political instability  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and other factors  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that the loss of any one or more of our manufacturers would not have a long term material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and cash flows  because numerous other manufacturers are available to fulfill our requirements  however  the loss of any of our major manufacturers could adversely affect our business until alternative manufacturing arrangements are secured 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results our quarterly financial results may vary significantly depending primarily upon factors such as the timing of significant orders  the timing of our new product offerings and those of our competitors and the loss or acquisition of any significant customers 
historically  our business has been influenced by the retail sales cycle  with increased sales in the last half of the year and the largest proportion of sales occurring in the last quarter 
factors such as quarterly variations in financial results could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause it to fluctuate substantially 
we i may from time to time increase our operating expenses to fund greater levels of research and development  increase our sales and marketing activities  develop new distribution channels  improve our operational and financial systems and broaden our customer support capabilities  ii may incur significant operating expenses associated with any new acquisitions  and iii may incur significant operating expenses in our efforts to comply with various government regulations 
to the extent such expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased revenues  our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows will be materially adversely affected 
we may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results that may be caused by many 
table of contents factors  including demand for products  introduction or enhancement of products by us and our competitors  the loss or acquisition of any significant customers  market acceptance of new products  price reductions by us or our competitors  mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  level of product returns  mix of customers and products sold  component pricing  mix of international and domestic revenues  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and general economic conditions 
in addition  as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment  we may from time to time make certain pricing or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as a result  we believe period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
dependence on consumer preference we are susceptible to fluctuations in our business based upon consumer demand for our products 
we believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to such fluctuations in consumer demand 
however  it is impossible to predict with complete accuracy the occurrence and effect of any such event that will cause such fluctuations in consumer demand for our products 
moreover  we caution that any increases in sales or growth in revenue that we achieve may be transitory and should by no means be construed to mean that such increases or growth will continue 
demand for consumer service and support we have continually provided domestic and international consumer service and support to our customers to add overall value and to help differentiate us from our competitors 
in march  our largest customer notified us that as a result of a merger  it would conduct all of its consumer service and support activities internally and cease using our services commencing the second quarter of consequently  revenue for consumer service and support from this customer has ceased 
in light of this  we have reviewed our domestic service and support group and are marketing our expertise in this area to other potential customers 
to date  we have not obtained any new customers  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract new customers in the future 
in addition  if other customers decide to cease using this service  we would be unable to offset costs associated with providing this service  resulting in a significant adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
dependence upon timely product introduction our ability to remain competitive in the wireless control products market will depend in part upon our ability to successfully identify new product opportunities and to develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products or in enhancing our existing products  or that such new or enhanced products will achieve consumer acceptance  and  if achieved  will sustain that acceptance  that products developed by others will not render our products non competitive or obsolete or that we will be able to obtain or maintain the rights to use proprietary technologies developed by others which are incorporated in our products 
any failure to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on our company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the introduction of new products may require the expenditure of a significant amount of funds for research and development  tooling  manufacturing processes  inventory and marketing 
in order to achieve high volume production of any new product  we may have to make substantial investments in inventory and expand our production capabilities 
dependence on major customers the economic strength and weakness of our worldwide customers affect our performance 
we sell our wireless control products and proprietary technologies to private label customers  original equipment manufacturers  and 
table of contents companies involved in the subscription broadcasting industry 
we also supply our products to our wholly owned  non us subsidiaries and to independent foreign distributors  who in turn distribute our products worldwide  with europe  asia  south africa  australia  and argentina currently representing our principal foreign markets 
during and  we had sales to one customer that amounted to more than ten percent of our net sales for the respective period 
in addition  for the same periods  we had sales to a customer and its sub contractors  that when combined  exceeded of net sales for the respective period 
the future loss of these customers or any key customer  either in the united states or abroad  due to the financial weakness or bankruptcy of any such customer or our inability to obtain orders or maintain our order volume with our major customers  may have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
simpledevices inc on october   we acquired simpledevices inc for approximately million in cash including direct acquisition costs  plus a performance based payment of our unregistered common stock to be paid in the future  if certain financial objectives are achieved 
simpledevices  a privately held company based in san mateo  california  develops software and firmware solutions that can enable devices such as tvs  set top boxes  stereos  automotive audio systems and other consumer electronic products to wirelessly connect and interact with home networks and interactive services to deliver digital entertainment and information 
while it is our current belief that this acquisition will be accretive in  such success will depend upon i our ability to bring simpledevices products to market in a timely and cost effective manner  ii the market accepting simpledevices products and technology to the extent anticipated by us  iii our ability to integrate simpledevices products and business into our own product offerings and business in a cost effective manner  and iv our ability to control the overall costs associated with simpledevices in the manner we anticipate 
the failure of any of these items could have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
internal investments during we hired people to develop and market additional products that are part of the nevo platform family 
in addition  outside resources were used  and continue to be used  to develop these products 
furthermore  there is certain minimum inventory purchases associated with these products 
since software based media control products are a departure from our traditional business  there is greater risk associated with the sales plans of these products 
competition the wireless control industry is characterized by intense competition based primarily on product availability  price  and speed of delivery  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  and quality and depth of product lines 
our competition is fragmented across our product lines  and  accordingly  we do not compete with any one company across all product lines 
we compete with a variety of entities  some of which have greater financial and other resources 
our ability to remain competitive in this industry depends in part on our ability to successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis  as well as our ability to identify and enter into strategic alliances with entities doing business within the industries we serve 
there can be no assurance that we and our product offerings will be and or remain competitive or that any strategic alliances  if any  which we enter into will achieve the type  extent and amount of success or business that we expect or hope to achieve 
patents  trademarks  and copyrights the procedures by which we identify  document and file for patent  trademark  and copyright protection are based solely on engineering and management judgment  with no assurance that a specific filing will issue  or if issued  will deliver any lasting value to us 
there is no assurance that rights granted under any patent will provide competitive advantages to us or will be adequate to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights 
moreover  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not offer protection on such products and associated intellectual property to the same extent that the us legal system may offer 
in our opinion  our intellectual property holdings and the engineering  production  and marketing skills and experience of our personnel are of equal importance to our market position 
we further believe that none of our businesses is dependent to any material extent upon any single patent  copyright  trademark  or trade secret 

table of contents some of our products include or use technology and or components of third parties 
while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of such products  we believe that  based upon past experience and industry practice  such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms  however  there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained on such terms or at all 
because of technological changes in the wireless and home control industry  current extensive patent coverage  and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  it is possible certain components of our products and business methods may unknowingly infringe upon patents of others 
potential for litigation as is typical in our industry and the nature and kind of business in which we are engaged  from time to time various claims  charges and litigation are asserted or commenced by third parties against us or by us against third parties  arising from or related to product liability  infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights  breach of warranty  contractual relations or employee relations 
the amounts claimed may be substantial  but they may not bear any reasonable relationship to the merits of the claims or the extent of any real risk of court awards assessed against us or in our favor 

table of contents we maintain directors and officers liability insurance which insures our individual directors and officers against certain claims such as those alleged in the above lawsuits  as well as attorney s fees and related expenses incurred in connection with the defense of such claims 
certain additional details regarding these legal actions are set forth in this annual report in part i  item  legal proceedings 
effects on universal due to international operations the risks of doing business internationally could adversely affect our sales  operations  earnings and cash flows due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to changes in a country s or region s economic or political conditions  including inflation  recession  interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military conflicts  currency fluctuations affecting sales  particularly in the euro and british pound  which contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions and also affect our reported results expressed in us dollars  currency fluctuations affecting costs  particularly the euro  british pound and the chinese yuan  which contribute to variances in costs in impacted jurisdictions and also affect our reported results expressed in us dollars  longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers  trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production  pricing and marketing of products  local labor conditions  customs  and regulations  changes in the regulatory or legal environment  differing technology standards or customer requirements  import  export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments  which could affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components or lead to penalties or restrictions  difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax efficient manner and changes in tax laws  fluctuations in freight costs and disruptions at important geographic points of exit and entry  and  natural and medical disasters 

table of contents general economic conditions general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  have an impact on our business and financial results 
the global economy remains uncertain 
as a result  individuals and companies may delay or reduce expenditures 
weak global economic conditions and or softness in the consumer and telecommunications sector could result in lower demand for our products  resulting in lower sales  earnings  and cash flows 
terrorism and acts of war terrorism and acts of war wherever occurring throughout the world may cause damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors  resellers or customers  which could significantly impact our revenue  costs  expenses  and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that have taken place and continue to take place throughout the world have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business and results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts or acts of war  including the ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan  have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  results of operations and stock price in ways that we cannot presently predict 
in addition  as a multi national company  actions taken against or by the united states may impact our business 
we are predominately uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
impact of oil prices we have an exposure to oil prices in two forms 
the first is in the prices of the oil based materials that we use in our products  which are primarily the plastics and other components that we include in our finished remotes and audio video accessories 
the second form is in the cost of delivery and freight  which would be passed on by the carriers that we use in the form of higher rates 
we record freight in as cost of sales  and freight out in operating expenses 
rising oil prices may have an adverse effect on cost of sales and operating expenses 
leased property we leased all of the properties used in our business and during  our properties located in cypress california  twinsburg ohio  and san mateo california will expire 
we are currently negotiating new or renewal leases for each of these properties and we believe that new or renewed leases will be entered into before the current leases expire and that when entered into  the leases will be satisfactory for our needs and purposes 
however  we can give no assurance that we will enter into the new or renewal leases or that  if entered into  the new lease terms will be similar to the existing terms or that the terms of any such new or renewal leases will not have a significant and material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
technology changes in wireless control we currently derive substantial revenue from the sales of wireless remote controls based on infrared ir technology 
other control technologies exist or could be developed that could compete with ir 
if other technology gains acceptance and starts to be integrated into home electronics devices currently controlled through our ir remote products  sales of our current line of ir based products may decrease 
failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to grow and meet key objectives 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend  in part  on our success in recruiting and retaining highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  and marketing personnel 
our corporate office  including our advance technology engineering group is based in southern california  where the high cost of living makes it difficult to attract talent from outside the region and may also put pressure on overall employment expenses 
we have also experienced difficulties in attracting qualified  technical personnel in our advanced technology software group 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineering and sales personnel  could 
table of contents make it difficult to meet key objectives  such as timely and effective product introductions 
change in competition and pricing we rely on third party manufacturers to build our universal wireless control products  based on our extensive ir code library and patented technology 
price is always an issue in winning and retaining business 
if customers become increasingly price sensitive  new competition could arise from manufactures who decide to go into direct competition with us or from current competitors who perform their own manufacturing 
if such a trend develops  we could experience downward pressure on our pricing or lose sales  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
more complex products could increase our support costs our kameleon and nevo line of products has more features and is more complex than our older products and therefore may require more end user technical support 
for our nevo product line  we currently rely  and intend to continue to rely  on the distributor or dealers to provide first line technical support to the end users 
however  we provide the second level of technical support for bug fixes and other issues at no additional charge 
therefore  as the mix of our products includes nevo and other more complex product lines  support costs could increase  which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
transportation costs we ship product from our foreign manufacturers via ocean and air transport 
however  it is sometime difficult to forecast swings in demand and therefore  products may be shipped via air which is more costly than ocean shipments 
often  we cannot recover the increased cost of airfreight from our customers 
the inability to predict demand swings can increase the cost of freight which could have a material adverse effect on our product margins 
our proprietary technologies may include design or performance defects and may not achieve their intended results we produce highly complex products that incorporate leading edge technology  including hardware  firmware  and software 
firmware and software may contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with operations 
there can be no assurance that our testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects  either defects in individual products or defects that could affect numerous shipments  which might interfere with customer satisfaction  reduce sales opportunities  or increase returns 
an inability to cure a product defect or the cost to repair a defect could result in the failure of a product line  temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market  damage to our reputation  inventory costs  or product reengineering expenses  any of which could have a material impact on revenues  margins  and net income 
acquisitions we may  from time to time  pursue acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that complement or expand our existing business  including those that could be material in size and scope 
acquisitions involve a number of risks  including the diversion of management s attention from day to day operations to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and the incorporation of acquired operations  customer bases  products or technologies 
such acquisitions could also have adverse short term effects on our operating results  and could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and the loss of key employees 
in addition  business acquisitions must be accounted for as purchases and  because most technology related acquisitions involve the purchase of significant intangible assets  these acquisitions typically result in substantial amortization charges and charges for acquired research and development projects  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will occur or  if such acquisitions do occur  the acquired businesses  customer bases  products or technologies will generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or effects 

table of contents outlook our focus is to build technology and products that make the consumer s interaction with devices and content within the home easier and more enjoyable 
the pace of change in the home is increasing 
the growth of new devices  such as dvd players  pvr dvr technologies and home theater solutions  to name only a few  has transformed control of the home entertainment center into a complex challenge for the consumer 
the more recent introduction and projected growth of digital media technologies in consumers lives will further increase this complexity 
we have set out to create the interface for the connected home  building a bridge between the home devices of today and the networked home of the future 
we intend to invest in new products and technology  particularly in the connected home space  which will expand our business beyond control of devices to the control of and access to content  such as digital media  to enrich the entertainment experience 
we will continue enhancing our leadership position in our core business by developing custom products for our subscription broadcasting  oem  retail  and computing customers  growing our capture expertise in existing infrared technology and emerging radio frequency standards  adding to our portfolio of patented or patent pending technologies and developing new platform products 
we also are developing new ways to enhance remote controls and other accessory products 
during  we continued to develop new products featuring our kameleon interface technology  a display technology that provides ease of use by illuminating only the keys needed to control each entertainment device 
we also continued development of our nevo technology  an embedded solution that transforms an electronic display such as hp s ipaq pocket pc into a sophisticated and easy to use wireless home control and automation device 
we are continuing to seek ways to integrate these platform technologies into other forms and devices 
nevo was launched in july of as a feature on a series of hp s handheld devices 
building on this platform  we will use nevo technology in a new product named nevo sl which we expect to ship in the second quarter of this product is designed for use in the home 
in addition  we are working on product line extensions to one for all audio video accessories which include digital antennas  signal boosters  television brackets and a v cleaning products 
we are also seeking ways to increase our customer base worldwide  particularly in the areas of subscription broadcasting  oem  and one for all international retail 
we will continue to work on strengthening existing relationships by working with customers to understand how to make the consumer interaction with products and services within the home easier and more enjoyable 
we intend to invest in new products and technology to meet our customer needs now and into the future 
simpledevices has developed connected device technology solutions that link the home computer and the internet to existing consumer electronic devices in the home and car 
the company provides upnp compatible software to power and connect devices  new media applications to make devices unique  and hardware reference designs 
the simpleware tm technology includes intelligent software for customizing  scheduling  and synchronizing specific content to designated devices 
this means that the technology can adapt to new products and emerging technology trends from playing mp files on the home stereo and in the car to streaming movies to the tv and the internet connected alarm clock 
in addition to capitalizing on the growing adoption of wi fi technology  these products also leverage the exploding popularity of digital media 
in  we will evaluate acceptable acquisition targets and strategic partnership opportunities in our core business lines as well as in the networked home marketplace 
we caution  however  that no assurance can be made that any suitable acquisition target or partnership opportunity will be identified and  if identified  that a transaction can be consummated 
moreover  if consummated  no assurance can be made that any such acquisition or partnership will profitably add to our operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
the interest payable under our revolving credit facility with our bank is variable and based on either i the bank s cost of funds or ii the libor rate plus a fixed margin of  the rate is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   we had no borrowings on our credit line 
the interest rate in effect on the credit line as of december  using the libor rate option plus a fixed margin of was 
at december  we had wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the netherlands  united kingdom  germany  france  argentina and spain 
sales from these operations are typically denominated in local currencies including euros  british pounds and argentine pesos  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
changes in local currencies exchange rates relative to the us dollar  and in some cases  to each other  may positively or negatively affect our sales  gross margins  net income and retained earnings 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange agreements to manage our exposure arising from fluctuating exchange rates that affect cash flows 
contract terms for the foreign currency exchange agreements normally last less than six months 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the sensitivity of earnings and cash flows to variability in exchange rates is assessed by applying an approximate range of potential rate fluctuations to our assets  obligations and projected results of operations denominated in foreign currencies 
based on our overall foreign currency rate exposure at december   we believe that movements in foreign currency rates could have a material affect on our financial position 
we estimate that if the exchange rates for the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar fluctuate from december   first quarter net income and cash flows would fluctuate by approximately million and million  respectively 
we estimate that if the exchange rates for the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar fluctuate from december   net income and cash flows for the year ending december  would fluctuate by approximately million and million  respectively 
the value of our net balance sheet positions held in foreign currencies can also be impacted by fluctuating exchange rates 
it is difficult to estimate the impact of fluctuations on reported income  as it depends on the opening and closing rates as well as the average net balance sheet positions held in a foreign currency 
we routinely forecast what these net balance sheet positions may be and we take steps to minimize exposure as management deems appropriate 
as a result of the foregoing factors discussed under this caption quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and above under the caption factors that may affect financial condition and future results  as well as other variables that affect our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods
