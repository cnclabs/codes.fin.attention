for the fiscal years discussed in this item  msc reports results on the basis of two business segments  msc engineered materials and solutions group ems and msc electronic materials and devices group emd 
ems s acoustical thermal material based solutions consist of layers of metal and other materials used to manage noise and thermal energy for the automotive  lighting and appliance markets 
ems s coated metal material based solutions include coil coated and electrogalvanized eg products primarily used in the automotive  building and construction  appliance  hvac and lighting markets 
ems s electronic material based solutions consist primarily of coated metal and laminated noise reducing materials used in the electronics market 
emd s electronic material based solutions include field effect technology for sensors  switches and interface solutions in the consumer electronics and transportation markets 
on june   msc sold substantially all the assets of emd and  therefore  only operates in one business segment after the first quarter of fiscal the general state of the principal industries in which the company operates presents a number of risks including overcapacity the domestic coil coating market is approximately over capacity resulting in extreme competition in pricing  terms of sale and facility utilization in the market place

critical accounting policies msc s significant accounting policies are presented within the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies included elsewhere in this form k 
while all of the significant accounting policies affect the company s consolidated financial statements  some of the policies may be viewed to be critical 
these policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
management bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of judgments and estimates form the basis for making judgments about the company s value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title msc s value added content in the case of toll processing and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company records shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due customers are recognized as earned and reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of income loss 
the company s revenue recognition policies comply with the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
the company also records expenses for manufacturing claims for product defects based upon historical experience and upon specific claims issues as they arise 
any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs are recorded on a monthly basis and are reflected in the historical experience prospectively 
the company had claims reserves of  as of february  a increase in the company s manufacturing claims experience would have the effect of increasing the reserve by long lived assets 
long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projections of cash flows on a non discounted basis 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference 
fair value is determined based on market quotes  if available  or is based on valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows 
the valuation techniques utilize certain assumptions made by the company including  but not limited to  estimated fair market value of assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as public market data  depreciation factors for orderly liquidation  including allowances such as dismantlement and removal  and the relationship between replacement cost new and market value based on the age of the assets 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate the actual current tax exposure state  federal and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent the company determines the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
the management of the company periodically estimates the probable tax obligations of the company using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company transacts business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 

table of contents defined benefit retirement plans 
the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans including the non contributory supplemental pension plans for some msc officers are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements entitled retirement plans 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting actuaries using a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate at which the obligation could be effectively settled and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts  results could be adversely affected 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the estimated future return on plan assets would have a relative effect on fiscal net pension expense 
the estimated future return on plan assets for the fiscal pension benefit income calculation is
