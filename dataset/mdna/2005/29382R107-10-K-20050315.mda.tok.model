item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december   and and consolidated financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a diversified spanish language media company with a unique portfolio of television  radio and outdoor advertising assets  reaching approximately of all hispanics in the united states 
we operate in three reportable segments television broadcasting  radio broadcasting and outdoor advertising 
as of the date of filing this report  we own and or operate primary television stations that are located primarily in the southwestern united states 
we own and operate radio stations fm and am located primarily in arizona  california  colorado  florida  nevada  new mexico and texas 
our outdoor advertising segment consists of approximately  advertising faces located primarily in los angeles and new york 
the comparability of our results between  and is significantly affected by acquisitions and dispositions in those periods 
in those years  we primarily acquired new media properties in markets where we already owned existing media properties 
while new media properties contribute to the financial results of their markets  we do not attempt to measure their effect as they typically are integrated into existing operations 
we generate revenue from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations and advertising on our billboards 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each medium s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast and when outdoor advertising services are provided 
we do not obtain long term commitments from our advertisers and  consequently  they may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalties 
we pay commissions to agencies for local  regional and national advertising 
for contracts directly with agencies  we record commissions as deductions from gross revenue 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting and outdoor advertising industries and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers 
our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staffs  commissions paid to our national representative firms  as well as expenses for marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist primarily of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets 
highlights despite a relatively difficult economic environment  we experienced growth for the year ended december   and net revenue of million 
of that amount  revenue generated by our television segment accounted for  revenue generated by our radio segment accounted for and revenue generated by our outdoor segment accounted for 
our television segment led our success again in  generating million in net revenue as we continued to sustain solid ratings across our station group 
we also launched an aggressive local sales initiative early in the year 
as a result  for the first time in our company s history  local advertising revenue growth exceeded national advertising revenue growth in three of the four quarters of the year 
local advertising now accounts for about half of our total television revenue 
our television results were driven by continued growth in our top advertising categories  including automotive  retail services  fast food restaurants and political advertising 
we were particularly pleased with the success of our telefutura group in telefutura is now vying with telemundo to be the second ranked spanish language station in several of our markets  behind our top ranked univision affiliates in those markets 
revenue from our telefutura stations in increased over although this contribution is still relatively small compared to our overall television revenue  we believe that it is an important source of future growth for our company 
in the first quarter of  we launched new telefutura affiliates in the two important border markets of mcallen and laredo  texas  giving us univision telefutura duopolies in of our television markets 
our radio segment also had a solid  contributing million in net revenue as we strengthened our sales efforts on both the national and local sales fronts 
early in the year we successfully completed the relocation of our radio network headquarters to los angeles and consolidated our outdoor division s corporate offices in that same facility 
this move has based our radio division in the nation s largest hispanic market  and its proximity to our outdoor division offers increased opportunities for cross selling and cross promotion between these two businesses 
in october  we purchased an fm radio station in the sacramento  california market  which increased our cluster to four stations in this important us hispanic market 
during the year we also completed the divestiture of non core radio stations in chicago and fresno  two markets where we did not see the opportunity to grow to scale and build out full clusters 
the sale of these properties  along with the disposition of a non core am radio station in dallas  allowed us to redeploy capital to markets with greater growth and earning potential 
one of our key challenges in was to replace a popular spanish language personality who left our radio network in although this has been an ongoing process  we believe that we made great strides this year by restructuring our radio programming department  including the appointment of a new programming director 
in total  we changed the formats of of our radio stations  with five of those stations successfully switching to our super estrella format  a pop and alternative spanish rock format that provides a musical home for young hispanics 
we also recently entered into a three year network affiliation agreement for the broadcast of renan alemendarez coello s popular el cucuy de la ma ana program on our radio tricolor network 
our outdoor segment rebounded from a challenging  providing million of our net revenue in in addition to benefiting from an overall improvement in the national advertising market in both new york and los angeles during the second half of the year  we also attribute the improvement in our outdoor business to several internal factors 
during the first half of the year  we replaced the head of the division and sales management in new york  los angeles and chicago in order to execute a more aggressive sales strategy throughout the segment 
we also initiated a maintenance program during the first half of to upgrade the quality of our and sheet poster inventory  which we believe helped to bolster advertisers interest in our posters 
looking ahead  we believe that the momentum that our outdoor segment created during the second half of will continue as we head further into we also took several key steps in toward strengthening our balance sheet and improving our capital structure 
in august  we refinanced our former bank credit facility with a new million senior secured facility 
we also repurchased all of our series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in two separate transactions during the third quarter 
finally  we converted all of our series u preferred stock held by univision into shares of our new class u common stock  so that by the end of we had no preferred stock outstanding 
acquisitions and dispositions during  we sold the assets of five radio stations three in chicago  illinois  one in fresno  california and one in dallas  texas for an aggregate of approximately million 
in september  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of diamond radio  inc  the owner and operator of radio station kbmb fm in the sacramento  california market for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we evaluated the transferred set of activities  assets  inputs  outputs and processes associated with this acquisition and determined that it constituted a business 
please see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in february  we acquired television stations kvtf ca and ktfv ca in the mcallen  texas market and television station ketf ca in the laredo  texas market  for an aggregate of approximately million 
also in february  we acquired the assets of radio station kaiq fm in the lubbock  texas market for approximately million 
we evaluated the transferred set of activities  assets  inputs  outputs and processes from each of our completed acquisitions and determined that the items excluded were significant and that each of these acquisitions was not considered a business 
pending acquisition in october  in combination with certain of our mexican affiliates and subsidiaries  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of the licensee of television station xhrio tv in matamoros  tamaulipas  mexico  serving the mcallen  texas market  as well as substantially all of the assets related to such station  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we currently expect this acquisition to close in the second quarter of relationship with univision univision currently owns approximately of our common stock on a fully converted basis 
in connection with its merger with hispanic broadcasting corporation in september  univision entered into an agreement with the us department of justice  or doj  pursuant to which univision agreed  among other things  to ensure that its percentage ownership of our company will not exceed by march  and by march  also pursuant to univision s agreement with doj  in september univision exchanged all of its shares of our class a and class c common stock that it previously owned for shares of our series u preferred stock 
the series u preferred stock was mandatorily convertible into common stock when and if we created a new class of common stock that generally had the same rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions as the series u preferred stock other than the nominal liquidation preference 
our stockholders approved the creation of such a new class of common stock  our class u common stock  during the second quarter of  and the shares of our series u preferred stock held by univision were converted into  shares of our new class u common stock effective as of july  neither the original exchange of univision s class a and class c common for our series u preferred stock  nor the subsequent conversion of such series u preferred stock into our new class u common stock  changed univision s overall equity interest in our company  nor did either have any impact on our existing television station affiliation agreements with univision 
the class u common stock has limited voting rights and does not include the right to elect directors 
however  as the holder of all of our issued and outstanding class u common stock  univision currently has the right to approve any merger  consolidation or other business combination involving our company  any dissolution of our company and any assignment of the federal communications commission  or fcc  licenses for any of our company s univision affiliated television stations 
each share of class u common stock is automatically convertible into one share subject to adjustment for stock splits  dividends or combinations of our class a common stock in connection with any transfer to a third party that is not an affiliate of univision 
results of operations separate financial data for each of our operating segments is provided below 
segment operating profit loss is defined as operating profit loss before corporate expenses and non cash stock based compensation 
we evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on the following years ended december  change to change to net revenue television radio outdoor consolidated direct operating expenses television radio outdoor consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses television radio outdoor consolidated depreciation and amortization television radio outdoor consolidated segment operating profit loss television radio outdoor consolidated corporate expenses loss gain on sale of assets non cash stock based compensation operating income broadcast cash flow television radio outdoor consolidated ebitda as adjusted capital expenditures television radio outdoor consolidated total assets television radio outdoor assets held for sale consolidated footnotes on next page footnotes from preceding page percentage not meaningful 
broadcast cash flow means operating income before corporate expenses  gain loss on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation 
ebitda as adjusted means broadcast cash flow less corporate expenses 
we use the term ebitda as adjusted because that measure does not include non cash stock based compensation 
we evaluate and project the liquidity and cash flows of our business using several measures  including broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted 
we consider these measures as important indicators of liquidity relating to our operations  as they eliminate the effects of non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation awards 
we use these measures to evaluate liquidity and cash flow improvement from year to year as they eliminate non cash expense items 
we believe that our investors should use these measures because they may provide a better comparability of our liquidity to that of our competitors 
our calculation of ebitda as adjusted included herein is substantially similar to the measures used in the financial covenants included in our bank credit facility and in the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
in those instruments  ebitda as adjusted is referred to as operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow  respectively 
under our bank credit facility  our ratio of debt to operating cash flow may not exceed to on a pro forma basis for the prior full four quarters 
under the indenture  the corresponding ratio of indebtedness to consolidated cash flow cannot exceed to on the same basis 
the actual ratios of indebtedness to each of operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow were as follows in each case as of december  to   to  and  to we entered into our new bank credit facility in august and issued our senior subordinated notes in march  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
for consistency of presentation  however  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definitions had been applied for all periods 
while we and many in the financial community consider broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted to be important  they should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
in addition  our definitions of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted differ from those of many companies reporting similarly named measures 
broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted are non gaap measures 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to each of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted is net income loss 
a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to net income loss follows unaudited  in thousands broadcast cash flow corporate expenses ebitda as adjusted loss gain on sale of assets non cash stock based compensation depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense interest income income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense income loss before equity in net earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates equity in net earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates income loss before discontinued operations gain on disposal of discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated operations net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the overall increase came mainly from our television and radio segments  which together accounted for million of the increase 
the increase from these segments was attributable to increased advertising sold referred to as inventory in our industry and increased rates for that inventory  partially offset by a decrease from our chicago and fresno radio stations sold 
the overall increase in net revenue also came from an increase in net revenue from our outdoor segment  which accounted for million of the increase 
we currently anticipate that the number of advertisers purchasing spanish language advertising will continue to rise and will result in greater demand for our inventory 
we expect that this increased demand will  in turn  allow us to continue to increase our rates  resulting in continued increases in net revenue in future periods 
direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the overall increase came mainly from our television and radio segments  which together accounted for million of the increase 
the increase from these segments was primarily attributable to an increase in commissions and national representation fees associated with the increase in net revenue and an increase in news costs due to the addition or expansion of newscasts in certain markets  partially offset by our chicago and fresno stations sold 
the overall increase also came from an increase in outdoor direct operating expenses  which accounted for million of the overall increase 
as a percentage of net revenue  direct operating expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  direct operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased because direct operating expense increases were outpaced by increases in net revenue 
we currently anticipate that  as our net revenue increases in future periods  our direct operating expenses correspondingly will continue to increase 
however  on a long term basis  we expect that net revenue increases will continue to outpace direct operating expense increases such that direct operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue will continue to decrease in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
our television segment accounted for a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a one time recovery of prior year expenses of million in accordance with the terms of an amendment to our marketing and sales agreement with univision and a reduction of losses incurred by our telefutura stations under our marketing and sales agreement with univision 
the overall decrease was partially offset by an increase from our radio and outdoor segments of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries  an increase in rent expense and severance amounts paid to the former president of our outdoor division  partially offset by our chicago and fresno stations sold 
as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased because selling  general and administrative expenses decreased while net revenue increased 
on a long term basis  although we currently anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods  we expect that net revenue increases will outpace any selling  general and administrative expense increases such that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue will continue to decrease in future periods 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase was mainly attributable to a million reimbursement from univision during the year ended december  offset by million of univision related expenses in that same period for legal and other costs associated with the third party information request that we received in connection with the merger between univision and hispanic broadcasting corporation 
the increase was also attributable to higher legal expenses related to financing the repurchase of our series a preferred stock  higher legal expenses related to our outdoor segment and higher expenses associated with our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  partially offset by lower insurance expenses 
as a percentage of net revenue  corporate expenses remained unchanged at for each of the years ended december  and excluding the prior year univision reimbursement and related expenses  corporate expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we currently anticipate that corporate expenses will continue to increase in future periods  primarily due to higher accounting and other costs associated with our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  including internal controls compliance 
nevertheless  we expect that these increases will be outpaced by net revenue increases such that corporate expenses as a percentage of net revenue will decrease in future periods 
gain loss on sale of assets

income tax expense 
our expected tax rate is approximately of pre tax income or loss  adjusted for permanent tax differences

as of december   million was outstanding under our bank credit facility and million was available for future borrowings 
we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit as of that date  which reduced the amount otherwise available for future borrowings 
our bank credit facility contains customary events of default 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we might be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the bank credit facility 
lenders holding more than of the loans and commitments under the bank credit facility may elect to accelerate the maturity of loans upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default 
our bank credit facility contains a mandatory prepayment clause  triggered in the event that we liquidate any assets if the proceeds are not utilized to acquire assets of the same type within days  receive insurance or condemnation proceeds which are not fully utilized toward the replacement of such assets within days 
in addition  if we have excess cash flow  as defined in our bank credit facility  in any year starting in  then of that excess cash flow must be used to reduce our outstanding loan balance 
our bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to maximum total debt ratio  minimum total interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenants become increasingly restrictive in the later years of the bank credit facility 
our bank credit facility also requires us to maintain our fcc licenses for our broadcast properties and contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  the payment of dividends  the making of acquisitions and the sale of assets over a certain limit 
additionally  we are required to enter into interest rate agreements if our leverage exceeds certain limits 
we can draw on our revolving facility without prior approval for working capital needs and for acquisitions having an aggregate maximum consideration of million or less 
acquisitions having an aggregate maximum consideration of greater than million but less than or equal to million are conditioned upon our delivery to the agent bank of a covenant compliance certificate showing pro forma calculations assuming such acquisition had been consummated and revised revenue projections for the acquired properties 
for acquisitions having an aggregate maximum consideration in excess of million  majority lender consent of the bank group is required 
debt and equity financing on april   we issued  shares of our class a common stock as a portion of the purchase price for the three radio stations we acquired from big city radio 
on may   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to register up to million of equity and debt securities  which we may offer from time to time 
that shelf registration statement has been declared effective by the sec 
we have not yet issued any securities under the shelf registration statement 
we intend to use the proceeds of any issuance of securities under the shelf registration statement to fund acquisitions or capital expenditures  to reduce or refinance debt or other obligations and for general corporate purposes 
on march   we issued million of our senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes bear interest at per year  payable semi annually on march and september of each year

broadcast cash flow means operating income before corporate expenses  gain loss on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation 
ebitda as adjusted means broadcast cash flow less corporate expenses 
we use the term ebitda as adjusted because that measure does not include non cash stock based compensation 
we evaluate and project the liquidity and cash flows of our business using several measures  including broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted 
we consider these measures as important indicators of liquidity relating to our operations  as they eliminate the effects of non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation awards 
we use these measures to evaluate liquidity and cash flow improvement from year to year as they eliminate non cash expense items 
we believe that our investors should use these measures because they may provide a better comparability of our liquidity to that of our competitors 
our calculation of ebitda as adjusted included herein is substantially similar to the measures used in the financial covenants included in our bank credit facility and in the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
in those instruments  ebitda as adjusted is referred to as operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow  respectively 
under our bank credit facility  our ratio of debt to operating cash flow may not exceed to on a pro forma basis for the prior full four quarters 
under the indenture  the corresponding ratio of indebtedness to consolidated cash flow cannot exceed to on the same basis 
the actual ratios of indebtedness to each of operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow were as follows in each case as of december  to   to  and  to we entered into our new bank credit facility in august and issued our senior subordinated notes in march  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
for consistency of presentation  however  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definitions had been applied for all periods 
while we and many in the financial community consider broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted to be important  they should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
in addition  our definitions of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted differ from those of many companies reporting similarly named measures 
broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted are non gaap measures 
for a reconciliation of each of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted to net income loss  their most directly comparable gaap financial measure  please see page cash flow net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net cash flow provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash flow used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we received proceeds of million from the sale of assets  primarily our radio stations in the chicago  illinois and fresno  california markets 
we also received a return on capital from lotus entravision reps llc in the amount of million 
we spent million on the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of diamond radio  inc  the owner and operator of radio station kbmb fm in the sacramento  california market 
we also spent million on capital expenditures and acquisition of intangibles and million to upgrade the signal of our radio station kdld fm in the los angeles  california market

we spent an aggregate of million to repurchase all  shares of our series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock from tsg capital fund iii  lp we received net proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options issued under our omnibus equity incentive plan and from the sale of shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
during  we anticipate that our maintenance capital expenditures will be approximately million  including approximately million in digital television and digital radio capital expenditures 
we anticipate paying for these capital expenditures out of net cash flow from operations 
as part of the mandated transition from analog to digital television  full service television station owners may be required to stop broadcasting analog signals and to relinquish one of their paired analog digital channels to the fcc at the end of  if the market penetration of digital television receivers reaches certain congressionally mandated levels by that time 
we currently expect that the cost to complete construction of digital television facilities for all of our full service television stations  which we are required to do by july   or face losing the stations protected coverage areas  will be approximately million 
in addition  we are required to broadcast separate digital and analog signals throughout this transition period 
we do not expect the incremental costs associated with dual transmission streams to be significant 
we intend to finance the conversion to digital television out of net cash flow from operations 
the amount of our anticipated capital expenditures may change based on future changes in business plans  our financial condition and general economic conditions 
we continually review  and are currently reviewing  opportunities to acquire additional television and radio stations  as well as other broadcast or media opportunities targeting the hispanic market in the united states 
we expect to finance any future acquisitions through funds generated from operations  borrowings under our bank credit facility and additional debt and equity financing 
any additional financing  if needed  might not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all 
any failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and our acquisition strategy 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a common stock 
repurchase of series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock during the third quarter of  we repurchased all  shares of our series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock from tsg capital fund iii  lp in two separate transactions for an aggregate of million

the final  shares were repurchased in september for million  funded by activating the multiple draw term loans available under our new bank credit facility  which loans were included in the facility specifically for the purpose of repurchasing the remaining shares of series a preferred stock 
the price of each repurchase reflected a small premium to the liquidation value at the time of such repurchase 
having now consummated the entire repurchase  no shares of our series a preferred stock remain issued and outstanding  and we have retired this series of preferred stock

application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are the most important to the accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require management s subjective judgment and may produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed and approved our related disclosure in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following are our critical accounting policies goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets effective january  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and determined each of our operating segments to be a reporting unit 
upon adoption  we assigned all of our assets and liabilities to our reporting units and ceased amortizing goodwill and our indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that our broadcast licenses and long term time brokerage agreements are indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and our estimates of the useful lives of our long lived assets are critical accounting estimates because goodwill and other intangible assets are our most significant assets  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as on our results of operations  could be material 
accordingly  the assumptions about future cash flows on the assets under evaluation are critical 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
assumptions about future revenue and cash flows require significant judgment because of the current state of the economy and the fluctuation of actual revenue and the timing of expenses 
we develop future revenue estimates based on projected ratings increases  planned timing of signal strength upgrades  planned timing of promotional events  customer commitments and available advertising time 
estimates of future cash flows assume that expenses will grow at rates consistent with historical rates 
alternatively  some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions about cash flows after conversion reflect estimates of how these stations are expected to perform based on similar stations and markets and possible proceeds from the sale of the assets 
if the expected cash flows are not realized  impairment losses may be recorded in the future 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit s carrying value  then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit s goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the impairment evaluation for indefinite life intangible assets is performed by a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
in addition  each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is determined to have a finite useful life  the asset will be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as intangible assets subject to amortization 
long lived assets  including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using accelerated and straight line methods over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances  such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
deferred taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
we have recorded a million tax benefit for net operating losses that are expected to offset future taxable income 
our net operating loss benefits will expire from to in order to realize the value of those assets  we would need to generate an aggregate of approximately million of taxable income prior to their expiration 
we currently estimate that we will recognize adequate taxable income over the next five to ten years sufficient to realize the value of these assets 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income  resolution of tax uncertainties and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
revenue recognition television and radio revenue related to the sale of advertising is recognized at the time of broadcast 
revenue for outdoor advertising space is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically less than months 
revenue contracts with advertising agencies are recorded at an amount that is net of the commission retained by the agency 
revenue from contacts directly with the advertisers is recorded at gross 
cash payments received prior to services rendered result in deferred revenue  which is then recognized as revenue when the services are actually provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable consist of a homogeneous pool of relatively small dollar amounts from a large number of customers 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
additional information for additional information on our significant accounting policies  please see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires that the measurement of all share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options and stock purchased through an employee stock purchase plan  be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value based method 
sfas no 
r is effective for all interim and annual periods beginning after june   and so will be effective for us at the beginning of our third quarter of we currently anticipate applying sfas no 
r using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized for i all awards granted after the required effective date and for awards modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date and ii the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
the impact of sfas no 
r for us in and beyond will depend upon various factors  including our future compensation strategy 
the pro forma compensation costs presented in our consolidated financial statements and in our prior filings have been calculated using the black scholes option pricing model and may not be indicative of the expense in future periods 
sensitivity of critical accounting estimates we have critical accounting estimates that are sensitive to change 
the most significant of those sensitive estimates relate to the impairment of intangible assets 
our television reporting unit fair value significantly exceeds its carrying value  but our impairment analysis for each of our radio and outdoor reporting units is sensitive to change as described below 
radio we performed an internal valuation of our radio reporting unit and did not find impairment of the reporting unit 
however  since our estimated fair value was not significantly greater than the carrying value in our internal valuation  we engaged an independent appraiser experienced in valuing radio broadcast properties to conduct an appraisal of the fair value of our radio reporting unit 
the appraiser combined radio properties into market clusters and used two different discounted cash flow models for its valuation 
in markets where we had mature stations with established cash flows  the model was based on our actual historical results and expected future cash flows 
in markets where stations were not mature and did not have established cash flows  the model was based on the station s projected ability to serve its market based on its signal coverage of the market 
based on the assumptions and projections included in the appraiser s analysis  the appraiser concluded that our radio reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately million as of october  upon receipt of the appraisal  we interviewed representatives of the appraiser at length regarding their findings and the methodologies used in the appraisal  and concluded that their methodologies were among several acceptable methodologies for valuing radio broadcast properties and that the results suggested that no impairment should be recorded with respect to our radio reporting unit 
however  if any of the estimates of future cash flows  discount rates or multiples used by the appraiser were to change in any future appraisal  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an expense for impairment 
outdoor we performed an internal valuation of our outdoor reporting unit and as a result of that valuation we believed that the estimated fair value of the outdoor reporting unit was below its carrying value by million  suggesting potential impairment 
since we had an indicator of potential impairment  as required under sfas no 
we estimated the fair value of the entire outdoor reporting unit and allocated the estimated fair value among its components  which consist primarily of fixed assets  customer list and goodwill 
after allocating the estimated fair value to the components  our estimated allocation of the implied fair value of the goodwill component exceeded its carrying value  so we determined that there is no impairment of goodwill 
we then evaluated the fixed assets and customer list of our outdoor reporting unit in accordance with sfas no 
 as they are classified as long lived assets 
as required under sfas no 
 we compared the outdoor reporting unit s undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the reporting unit s assets 
we determined that the sum of its projected undiscounted cash flows  including the estimated value of our billboards  exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit s assets  resulting in the recovery of its value and no impairment of the long lived assets 
in the calculation of the estimated fair value of our outdoor reporting unit  we used a combination of valuation techniques that rely on various assumptions such as estimated discounted future cash flows and multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our estimates of future cash flows assume that we will significantly increase our outdoor revenues as compared with our outdoor expenses  and that our billboards will also increase in value 
if those estimates of future cash flows  discount rates or multiples were to change  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an expense for impairment 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into four no fee interest rate swap agreements covering an aggregate of of the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility  described more fully in item a below 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the potential loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in the financial markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the base rates on our variable rate debt 
under our bank credit facility  if we exceed certain leverage ratios we are required to enter into derivative financial instrument transactions  such as swaps or interest rate caps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to risk from changes in interest rates 
under no circumstances do we enter into derivatives or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rates our term loan bears interest at libor plus a margin of  for a total interest rate of at december  our revolving facility bears interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to based on our leverage 
as of december   we had million of variable rate bank debt outstanding 
our bank credit facility requires us to enter into interest rate agreements if our leverage exceeds certain limits as defined in our credit agreement 
we have four interest rate swap agreements  two with a notional amount of million and two with a notional amount of million 
the first million agreement provides for a libor based rate floor of and rate ceiling of and terminates on march  the second million agreement  which begins after the first agreement expires  provides for a libor based rate floor of and rate ceiling of and terminates on march  the two million agreements  which begin after the second million agreement expires  provide for a libor based rate floor of and rate ceiling of and terminate on october  because this portion of our long term debt is subject to interest at a variable rate  our earnings will be affected in future periods by changes in interest rates 
in the event that the libor rate falls below the floor rate  we would still have to pay the floor rate plus the margin based on our leverage at such time 
if the libor rate falls near or below the floor rate during the swap agreement period  we would record the fair market value of the swap agreement as a liability on the balance sheet and interest expense on the income statement 
in the event that the libor rate rises above the ceiling rate  we would only have to pay the ceiling rate plus the applicable margin 
if the libor rate rises near or above the ceiling rate during the swap agreement period  the fair market value of the swap agreement would be recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and a reduction of interest expense on the income statement 
due to the short term nature of these agreements and our current anticipation that the interest rate floors or ceilings will not be approached during their terms  the estimated fair value of these agreements is not significant as of december  a one percent increase in our variable interest rate would increase interest expense on an annual basis by approximately million 
this amount is determined by calculating the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change on our floating rate debt after giving consideration to our swap agreements 
this estimate does not include the effects of other possible occurrences such as actions to mitigate this risk or changes in our financial structure
