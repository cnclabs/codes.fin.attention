item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item contains forward looking statements  which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of management overview we are a leading provider of contract services to the north american oil and natural gas industry 
our services primarily involve the drilling  on a contract basis  of land based oil and natural gas wells and to a lesser extent  we provide pressure pumping services and drilling and completion fluid services 
in addition to the aforementioned contract services  we also engage in the development  exploration  acquisition and production of oil and natural gas 
for the three years ended december   our operating revenues consisted of the following dollars in thousands contract drilling pressure pumping drilling and completion fluids oil and natural gas we provide our contract services to oil and natural gas operators in many of the oil and natural gas producing regions of north america 
our contract drilling operations are focused in various regions of texas  
table of contents new mexico  oklahoma  louisiana  mississippi  colorado  utah  wyoming and western canada while our pressure pumping services are focused primarily in the appalachian basin 
our drilling and completion fluids services are provided to operators in texas  southeastern new mexico  oklahoma  the gulf coast region of louisiana and the gulf of mexico 
our oil and natural gas operations are primarily focused in west texas  south texas  southeastern new mexico  utah and mississippi 
we have been a leading consolidator of the land based contract drilling industry over the past several years increasing our drilling fleet to rigs as of december  based on publicly available information  we believe we are the second largest owner of land based drilling rigs in north america 
our most significant transaction occurred in may when we merged with uti energy corp 
in a merger of equals which basically doubled our drilling fleet and added the pressure pumping services business 
growth by acquisition has been a corporate strategy intended to expand both revenues and profits 
the profitability of our business is most readily assessed by two primary indicators our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day 
during  our average number of rigs operating increased to from in and our average revenue per operating day increased to  from  in primarily due to these improved operating results  we experienced an increase of approximately million in consolidated net income in our revenues  profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon the market prices of oil and natural gas 
during periods of improved commodity prices  the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand  which results in increased demand for our contract services 
conversely  in periods of time when these commodity prices deteriorate  the demand for our contract services generally weakens and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services 
in addition  our operations are highly impacted by competition  the availability of excess equipment  labor issues and various other factors which are more fully described as risk factors in our forward looking statements and cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of contained on page of this report 
management believes that the liquidity of our balance sheet as of december   which includes approximately million in working capital including million in cash  no long term debt and a million line of credit with availability of million net of outstanding letters of credit totaling million provides us with the ability to pursue acquisition opportunities  expand into new regions  make improvements to our property and equipment and survive downturns in our industry 
commitments and contingencies we have no commitments or contingencies which require disclosure in our financial statements other than letters of credit of approximately million at december   maintained for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which may become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts 
no amounts have been drawn under the letters of credit 
net income for the year ended december   includes a charge of million related to the financial failure in of a workers compensation insurance carrier that had provided coverage for us in prior years 
trading and investing we have not engaged in trading activities that include high risk securities  such as derivatives and non exchange traded contracts 
we invest cash primarily in highly liquid  short term investments such as overnight deposits  money markets and highly rated municipal and commercial bonds 
description of business we conduct our contract drilling operations in texas  new mexico  oklahoma  louisiana  mississippi  colorado  utah  wyoming and western canada 
as of december   we owned drilling rigs 
we provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in the appalachian basin 
these services consist primarily of well stimulation and cementing for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells 
we provide drilling fluids  completion fluids and related services to oil and natural gas operators in texas  southeastern new mexico  oklahoma  the gulf coast region of louisiana and the gulf of mexico 
drilling and completion fluids are used by oil and natural gas operators during the drilling process to control pressure when drilling oil and natural gas wells 
we are also 
table of contents engaged in the development  exploration  acquisition and production of oil and natural gas 
our oil and natural gas operations are focused primarily in producing regions in west texas  south texas  southeastern new mexico  utah and mississippi 
the north american land drilling industry has experienced many downturns in demand over the last several years 
during these periods  there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand 
as a result  drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins 
in addition to adverse effects that future declines in demand could have on us  ongoing factors which could adversely affect utilization rates and pricing  even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity  include movement of drilling rigs from region to region  reactivation of land based drilling rigs  and new construction of drilling rigs 
we cannot predict either the future level of demand for our contract drilling services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling business 
critical accounting policies in addition to established accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment  oil and natural gas properties  goodwill  revenue recognition and the use of estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment  including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset  are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred 
we provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle  we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight line basis 
no provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment 
we review our assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain assets either exceed their respective fair values or may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives 
the cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time 
management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will fluctuate 
based on management s expectations of future trends  we estimate future cash flows in our assessment of impairment assuming the following four year industry cycle one year projected with low utilization  one year projected as a recovery period with improving utilization and the remaining two years projecting higher utilization 
provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are less than the asset s net book value 
impairment charges are recorded based on discounted cash flows 
there were no impairment charges to property and equipment during the years  or oil and natural gas properties oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  exploration costs which result in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves and all development costs are capitalized to the appropriate well 
exploration costs which do not result in discovering oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense when such determinations are made 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  sfas no 
costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized to wells in progress until the outcome of the drilling is known 
we review wells in progress quarterly to determine the related reserve classification 
if the reserve classification is uncertain after one year following the completion of drilling  we consider the costs of the well to be impaired and recognize the costs as expense 
geological and geophysical costs  including seismic costs and costs to carry and retain undeveloped properties  are charged to expense when incurred 
the capitalized costs of both developmental and successful exploratory type wells  consisting of lease and well 
table of contents equipment  lease acquisition costs and intangible development costs  are depreciated  depleted and amortized on the units of production method  based on engineering estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves of each respective field 
we review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment when an event occurs such as downward revisions in reserve estimates or decreases in oil and natural gas prices 
proved properties are grouped by field and undiscounted cash flow estimates are provided by an independent petroleum engineer 
if the net book value of a field exceeds its undiscounted cash flow estimate  impairment expense is measured and recognized as the difference between its net book value and discounted cash flow 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed quarterly to determine impairment 
our intent to drill  lease expiration and abandonment of area are considered 
assessment of impairment is made on a lease by lease basis 
if an unproved property is determined to be impaired  then costs related to that property are expensed 
impairment expense of approximately million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  is included in depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment in the accompanying financial statements 
goodwill goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized 
as such  we assess impairment of our goodwill annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
with respect to our drilling and completion fluids business  the determination that no impairment existed as of december   was based on the segment s improved operating results in and on our expectations that these improved results will continue 
if the improved results do not continue  all or part of the goodwill of approximately million associated with that business segment may be determined to be impaired 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when services are performed  except for revenues earned under turnkey contract drilling arrangements which are recognized using the completed contract method of accounting  as described below 
we follow the percentage of completion method of accounting for footage contract drilling arrangements 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates are relied upon in the determination of the total estimated expenses to be incurred drilling the well 
due to the nature of turnkey contract drilling arrangements and risks therein  we follow the completed contract method of accounting for such arrangements 
under this method  revenues and expenses related to a well in progress are deferred and recognized in the period the well is completed 
provisions for losses on incomplete or in process wells are made when estimated total expenses are expected to exceed estimated total revenues 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 we recognize reimbursements received from third parties for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenues and account for out of pocket expenses as direct costs 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
key estimates used by management include allowance for doubtful accounts  total expenses to be incurred on footage and turnkey drilling contracts  depreciation  depletion  and amortization  asset impairment  reserves for self insured levels of insurance coverages  and fair values of assets and liabilities assumed

table of contents related party transactions we operate certain oil and natural gas properties in which certain of our affiliated persons have participated  either individually or through entities they control  in the prospects or properties in which we have an interest 
these participations  which have been on a working interest basis  have been in prospects or properties we originated or acquired 
at december   affiliated persons were working interest owners in of total wells we operated 
we make sales of working interests to reduce our economic risk in the properties 
generally  it is more efficient for us to sell the working interests to these affiliated persons than to market them to unrelated third parties 
sales of working interests were made at cost  including our costs of acquiring and preparing the working interests for sale 
these costs were paid by the working interest owners on a pro rata basis based upon their working interest ownership percentage 
the price at which working interests were sold to affiliated persons was the same price at which working interests were sold to unaffiliated persons 
production revenues and joint interest costs of each of the affiliated persons during for all wells operated by us in which the affiliated persons have working interests are presented in the table below 
these amounts do not necessarily represent their profits or losses from these interests because the joint interest costs do not include the parties related drilling and leasehold acquisition costs incurred prior to january  these activities resulted in a payable to the affiliated persons of approximately million and  and a receivable from the affiliated persons of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million including cash and cash equivalents of million 
for  our sources of cash flow included million from operations  million from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and million from the sale of property and equipment 
we used approximately million to make capital expenditures for the betterment and refurbishment of our drilling rigs  for the acquisition and procurement of drilling equipment  to fund capital expenditures for our pressure pumping and drilling and completion fluids divisions  and to fund leasehold acquisition and development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties 
additionally  million was used to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock  million was used to buy  shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock buyback program authorized by our board of directors on june  and issuance costs of  were incurred during relating to our new million credit facility 
as of december   million of cash was pledged as collateral for losses which could become payable under the terms of our workers compensation insurance contracts and was therefore restricted as to use 
in february  we completed the acquisition of tmbr in which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired of the remaining outstanding shares of tmbr for a net cash payment of million million paid to tmbr shareholders less million in cash acquired in the transaction and the issuance of million shares of our common stock valued at per share adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split on june  
the assets of tmbr included land based drilling rigs and related equipment  shop facilities  equipment yards and their oil and natural gas properties 
the transaction was accounted for as a business combination and the purchase price was allocated among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values 
we replaced our prior credit facility in december with a five year  million unsecured revolving line of credit loc 
interest is to be paid on outstanding loc balances at a floating rate ranging from libor plus to or the prime rate 
this arrangement includes various fees  including a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount at december  
there are customary restrictions and covenants associated with the loc 
financial covenants provide for a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
we do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will restrict our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise 
availability under the loc is reduced by outstanding letters of credit which totaled million at december  there were no outstanding borrowings under the loc at december  we incurred approximately  in costs to terminate the previous million credit facility 
these costs were expensed in 
table of contents in december  we entered into an agreement to acquire the us land drilling assets of key energy services  inc for approximately million 
the assets include active and stacked land based drilling rigs  related drilling equipment  four yard facilities and a rig moving fleet consisting of approximately trucks and trailers 
this transaction was completed in january using approximately million of cash 
in february  our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend on the company s common stock to per share from per share 
the next quarterly cash dividend is to be paid to holders of record on february  and paid on march  we believe that the current level of cash and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet our capital needs 
from time to time  acquisition opportunities are evaluated 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition and the associated capital commitments are unpredictable 
should opportunities for growth requiring capital arise  we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital  cash generated from operations  our existing credit facility and additional debt financing or equity financing 
however  there can be no assurance that such capital would be available

volatility of oil and natural gas prices our revenue  profitability and rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  with respect to all of our operating segments 
for many years  oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile 
prices are affected by market supply and demand factors as well as international military  political and economic conditions  and the ability of opec  to set and maintain production and price targets 
all of these factors are beyond our control 
natural gas prices fell from an average of per mcf in the first quarter of to an average of per mcf for the same period in during this same period  the average number of our rigs operating dropped by approximately 
the average market price of natural gas improved from in to in and in  resulting in an increase in demand for our drilling services 
our average number of rigs operating increased from in to in and in we expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition and operations and ability to access sources of capital 
the north american land drilling industry has experienced many downturns in demand over the last several years 
during these periods  there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand 
as a result  drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins

our exposure to interest rate risk due to changes in libor is not expected to be material 
we conduct some business in canadian dollars through our canadian land based drilling operations 
the exchange rate between canadian dollars and us dollars has fluctuated over the last several years 
if the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar weakens  revenues and earnings of our canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our canadian net assets in us dollars may decline
