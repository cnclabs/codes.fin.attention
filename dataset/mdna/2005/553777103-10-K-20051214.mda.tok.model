table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
additional information relative to these risks is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
foreign currency exchange risk the company is directly exposed to the financial impact of market changes in currency exchange rates on orders  revenue  and net income  as well as on the translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars 
this is in addition to the indirect impact of changes in currency exchange rates on interest rates and overall business activity 
gains and losses from the settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions are recorded within other expense income  net in the consolidated statements of income included in item of this form k 
currency gains and losses on specifically identified currency hedge transactions  as well as changes in the translated values of long term assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency  are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet 
when a gain or loss is recognized on the hedged exposure or the hedge is determined to be ineffective  associated mark to market gains and losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to other expense income  net on the consolidated statement of income 
the following table restates financial results utilizing currency exchange rates from the prior year to hypothetically estimate the impact of currency on the following financial items expressed in thousands increase from currency translation on orders    revenue    net income   transaction loss gain included in other expense income  net   a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies increases the value of foreign currency denominated revenue and earnings translated into us dollars 
conversely  a strengthening of the us dollar decreases the value of foreign currency denominated revenue and earnings 
during fiscal year  the us dollar generally strengthened against other major currencies  increasing by approximately against the euro and by approximately against the japanese yen 
however  the net effect of currency translation on orders  revenue  and net income during the year was favorable due to the delayed effect of currency changes relative to the calculation of the weighted average income statement rates used to translate the consolidated statements of income 
gains and losses attributed to translating the financial statements for all non us subsidiaries are included in the currency translation adjustments recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet 
a hypothetical appreciation in foreign currencies against the us dollar  assuming all other variables were held constant  would have resulted in an increase in fiscal year revenue and asset balances of approximately million 
a hypothetical depreciation in foreign currencies against the us dollar  assuming all other variables were held constant  would have resulted in a decrease in fiscal year revenue and asset balances of approximately million 
the company regularly assesses its exposure to changes in market currency rates and employs certain practices to mitigate possible adverse effects of this risk 
the company utilizes forward currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the functional currency value of foreign currency denominated transactions
