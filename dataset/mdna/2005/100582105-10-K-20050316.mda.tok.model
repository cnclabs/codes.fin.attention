item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations overview we develop products and services that enable wireless operators to fully realize the potential of their networks 
our access management  billing  payment and network solutions help operators rapidly deploy and manage innovative voice and data services for subscribers 
available as licensed products and fully managed services  our solutions power wireless operators and enable mvno s with market leading implementations of prepaid wireless  postpaid billing  wireless account funding and m commerce 
we provide our fully managed services and licensed products domestically to us wireless operators 
internationally  we offer our products to wireless operators on a licensed basis 
we sell our products and services to our wireless operator customers through our direct sales force in the united states and both direct and indirect channels internationally 
we generate revenues from real time billing as a managed service principally by charging operators for each minute of use processed through our platform 
we record real time billing services revenues net of outage penalties that we may incur based on contracted service level agreements with the wireless operators 
we also generate revenues from other transactions processed  including sms  ptt and other data services 
additionally  whether deployed on a managed service basis or licensed basis  we generate revenues from software licensing  implementations and special development services 
these revenues are typically recognized over the term of the contract for managed services customers and at the time of shipment for licensed sales 
our voyager billing revenues are earned by generating a monthly subscriber s bill 
while there were no bcgi access management revenues in  we expect that we will generate revenues from this product by charging wireless operators as a percentage of their revenues or on a monthly per subscriber or account basis 
for bcgi payment  we typically generate revenue by charging wireless operators a transaction fee for the services performed and paying the financial partners a fee for enabling the transaction 
bcgi network is expected to generate revenues on a managed services basis by charging wireless operators a fee for each transaction processed or as a percentage of revenue 
licensed sale revenues currently comprise about of revenue and are generally recognized when the system is shipped  with installation and maintenance recorded as the services are performed 
our total revenues increased to million in compared to million in in  total revenues increased from million in our operating income of million in is an increase of over million in operating income in increased million from operating income of million in we anticipate that earnings per share for the first quarter of will decrease from the fourth quarter of  due to lower revenues and increased cost of revenues  sales and marketing costs and legal costs to support the freedom wireless lawsuit 
we have not provided guidance for the remainder of since we cannot anticipate the rate and timing of verizon wireless and cingular wireless subscriber departure from our real time billing platform and therefore  the corresponding rate of revenue decline 
in addition  verizon wireless may terminate our existing prepaid wireless services agreement upon days written notice 
we plan to continue to focus on our customer and product diversification strategy that includes investment in all of our new and existing products that we are marketing on a global basis 
in march  we ceased providing our roamerplus solution  effectively discontinuing our roaming services segment 
during the quarter ended september  we began a phased shut down of our tulsa operation  which housed much of the operations that support our prepaid systems business and began to integrate the prepaid 
table of contents systems business into our massachusetts locations 
the expenses we have incurred to close this facility are reflected in our operating results 
as a result  beginning with the fourth quarter of  we no longer reported the prepaid systems business as a separate segment 
revenues our total revenues increased to million in compared to million in and million in in  total revenues increased by over the revenue increase in was due primarily to additional revenue from nextel communications  partially offset by lower revenues from verizon wireless 
the increase was also attributable to an increase in the average billed minutes of use per subscriber per month to for compared to in these increases were partially offset by an decrease in our average billed rate per minute 
our us subscriber base remained consistent with million subscribers as of december  and the revenue increase in compared to was due primarily to additional revenues from verizon  cingular and nextel 
the increase was also attributable to an increased subscriber base of million in compared to million in along with an increase in the average billed minutes of use per subscriber per month to an average of for compared to in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our average billed rate per minute in compared to we expect the number of subscribers and corresponding revenues to decrease in due to the subscriber reductions from verizon wireless and cingular wireless 
gross margin gross margin increased to of revenues in from in and in the improvement in and was primarily due to increased revenues as well as our predominantly fixed cost infrastructure 
our gross margin is expected to decrease to about to in the first quarter of due to lower revenues  along with additional costs for resources to support our licensed sale business and international expansion

the increase in er d expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in compared to resulted from additional personnel and the corresponding wage increase of million principally to support the development of bcgi access management  along with the enhancement of the features and functionality of our existing and other new products 
this increase was partially offset by an approximate  decrease in bonuses earned by employees relating to our financial performance compared to 
table of contents the increase in er d expenses in absolute dollars in compared to resulted from additional personnel and the corresponding wage increase of approximately million to support the development of bcgi access management and the voyager billing product acquired in october  along with the enhancement of the features and functionality for our existing products 
additionally  the increase was a result of approximately  in additional bonuses earned by employees relating to our financial performance compared to er d expenses in absolute dollars are expected to remain consistent in the first quarter of compared with the million incurred in the fourth quarter of sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include direct sales and product management salaries  commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  in addition to the cost of trade shows  direct mail and other promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses in increased in absolute dollars over due to higher commissions of approximately  resulting from higher revenues along with increased trade show costs of approximately  and increased promotional costs of approximately  to support mobile guardian and other diversification efforts 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of approximately  for bonuses earned relating to our financial performance compared to sales and marketing expenses increased in as compared to due to additional wages of approximately  reflecting our investment in new products and our revenue diversification strategy as well as the full year of expenses from the isc acquisition 
in addition  the increase was due to higher bonuses approximately  earned by employees relating to our financial performance compared to  increased wages of approximately  supporting our investment in the bcgi payment business and increased commissions of approximately  due to higher revenues 
sales and marketing expenses of million in the fourth quarter of are expected to increase by more than million in the first quarter of the increase reflects certain first quarter only events including the investment in our rebranding effort and our participation in two major tradeshows  as well as our long term focus on expanding our product offerings on a global scale 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses include salaries and benefits of employees and other expenses that provide our administrative support 
the increase in g a expenses in absolute dollars in compared to was due to higher costs associated with expanded regulatory requirements and related costs for public companies totaling approximately  which was partially offset by decreases of approximately  for bonuses earned by employees relating to our financial performance compared to the increase in g a expenses in absolute dollars in compared to was due to additional bonuses of  relative to our financial performance compared to  higher costs associated with new regulatory requirements for public companies of  a full year of expenses about  from our isc acquisition and approximately  in wages for additional personnel to support our growth 
g a expenses in absolute dollars are expected to remain consistent in the first quarter of compared with million from the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses legal charges general and administrative legal expenses primarily represent legal expenses to defend the patent infringement suit initiated by freedom wireless 
we expect to incur approximately to million in legal expenses in the first quarter of as a result of the commencement of the trial  and  on average  million per quarter thereafter  until the freedom wireless matter is resolved 
however  this cost will likely continue to vary from quarter to quarter  depending on the timing of proceedings 
there can be no assurance that costs to defend the freedom wireless suit will not exceed our estimate 
if freedom wireless prevails in this case  the amount of damages could be substantial and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of telecommunications systems and software  building  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
we provide for depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to twenty years 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as compared to was attributable to additional telecommunication equipment and software to enhance our managed services platform as well as further develop our licensed products 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in absolute dollars in compared to was due to more capital deployed to support growth and continued enhancements in our managed services business and  to a lesser extent  due to a full year of depreciation expense related to the purchase of our bedford  massachusetts facility and a full year of amortization of intangible assets from the isc acquisition 
depreciation expense is expected to increase slightly in the first quarter of as compared to million in the fourth quarter of interest income interest income remained consistent at million in compared to million in and decreased from million in interest income was earned primarily from investments  which were purchased using the cash generated from operations  from the sale of our teleservices business in and from the proceeds from our public offerings 
although our combined cash and investment positions increased in and  lower average interest rates during the periods resulted in decreased levels of interest income compared to the previous years 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  and was compared to for the year ended december  the income tax rate was in primarily due to the recognition of certain state investment tax credits in the fourth quarter of the income tax rate decreased in due to the utilization of state net operating loss carryforwards that had not been valued 
acquisitions in october  we completed the acquisition of isc  a privately held provider of billing software solutions for the wireless marketplace  providing us with an outsourced postpaid billing service for wireless operators 
we paid million in cash to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of isc 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill 
management determined the fair value of the assets acquired by considering the anticipated cash flows to be generated from the existing products  the valuation of customer relationships  the estimated life of the technology acquired and other factors 
identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired technology and customer contracts and are being amortized over five years 
we accrued  at december  for contingent consideration payable to isc based on qualified revenues earned in under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
this compares to contingent consideration of  accrued at december  and paid in both of these accruals were recorded as increases to goodwill 
we may be required to pay additional contingent cash consideration based on isc attaining certain defined annual revenue targets in  which will be accounted for as additional goodwill 
the results of operations of isc are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
in november  we acquired the assets of airada  a privately held provider of payment management software solutions for the wireless marketplace 
we paid million in cash for airada 
management determined the fair value of the assets acquired by considering the anticipated cash flows to be generated from the existing products  the valuation of customer relationships  the estimated life of the technology acquired and other factors 
identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired technology and customer contracts and are being 
table of contents amortized over five years 
we may be required to pay additional contingent cash consideration based on attaining certain defined annual revenue and operational targets through  most of which will be accounted for as additional goodwill 
the results of operations of airada are included in our consolidated statement of operations from the date of acquisition 
selected quarterly operating results the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of our operations for the eight quarters in the two year period ended december   including such amounts expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
this quarterly information is unaudited  prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of our management  reflects all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring accruals  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented

the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  capitalized software and labor  long lived assets  goodwill and intangible asset impairment  legal expenses  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be our most critical policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts legal costs research and development  software development costs and costs capitalized for internal use impairment of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill accounting for income taxes revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts our revenue recognition policy is critical because revenue is a key component affecting our operations 
in addition  revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and bonuses 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in recognizing revenue  however  certain judgments relating to the elements required for revenue recognition affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are 
table of contents difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue  changes in judgments concerning recognition of revenue  changes in uncollectible or bad debt estimates  changes in mix  amount of international sales or delays in recognizing revenue  could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we recognize our revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and application of emerging issues task force issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we earn revenues in various ways  depending on the type of transaction 
for our managed services business  we earn revenues in the following ways for real time billing  we earn revenues principally by processing prepaid wireless minutes  net of any penalties incurred related to outages on our platform 
for bcgi payment  we earn revenues by processing transactions on behalf of wireless operators subscribers 
for voyager billing  we earn revenues by generating a postpaid subscriber s monthly bill 
each of these revenues is recognized when the service is provided 
for license fees  special projects and implementation services related to our managed services business  revenues are typically recognized ratably over the remaining life of the contract with the wireless operator 
for multiple element arrangements  we determine the fair value of each element based on our specific objective evidence for that element and allocate total revenue from these arrangements to each element based on its fair value 
for our licensed systems business  we typically recognize revenue from the sale of systems at the time the systems are shipped or delivered to the customer  depending on shipping terms 
in the event there are acceptance terms  we defer revenue until acceptance has occurred 
installation revenue is deferred until the entire installation is complete 
revenues from maintenance and support and other services are based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support contract period or when the services are performed 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance and support is based upon the amount charged when the service is sold separately  which is typically the contract s renewal rate 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for installation and other services is based upon standard pre established rates 
in addition to recording revenues net of any penalties incurred related to outages on our managed services platform and estimated amounts that may be disputed  we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet their financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit scores  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in addition  we record reserves based on the length of time the receivables are past due and on historical experience 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet their financial obligations  estimates of amounts recoverable could be adversely affected 
we believe that our allowance for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts fairly represents the potential amount of bad debt we could incur 
legal costs we accrue the costs of settlements  damages and  under certain conditions  costs of defense when such costs are probable and estimable  otherwise  such costs are expensed as incurred 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are expensing legal costs related to the freedom wireless lawsuit as incurred due to the lengthy and unpredictable proceedings which had made it difficult to reasonably estimate legal costs for the lawsuit 
research and development  software development costs and costs capitalized for internal use research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
however  costs incurred for the development of computer software or for the deployment of assets for internal use are capitalized 
the direct labor and payroll related costs of development of computer software  primarily for coding and testing of software  are capitalized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of 
table of contents position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the direct labor  travel and payroll related costs to deploy assets for internal use are capitalized until the asset is placed in service 
we make judgments regarding the specific time that can be capitalized based upon the type of project and type of work being performed 
the capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on management s judgment  which contemplates the anticipated future undiscounted net cash flows and changes in hardware and software technologies 
internally capitalized costs totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  amortization of capitalized software development costs begins when the solution is made available for general release and amortization of internal use costs begins when the related asset is first placed into service 
these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over a three year period 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which result in an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when indicators of impairment exist and the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets  other than goodwill  may not be recoverable  we compare the projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets  which are determined considering a number of factors including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends and solution development cycles  to their carrying value 
if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the asset is considered impaired and the carrying value is then compared to the asset s fair value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded immediately in the statement of income 
fair value is determined by either a quoted market price or use of a present value technique  which requires judgments to be made by management regarding estimating future cash flows  economic life and discount rates  among other assumptions 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
for impairment tests of goodwill  we utilize the enterprise wide approach  which is based on the aggregate market value of our common stock  to determine the fair value of our reporting segment and compare that to our consolidated net book value to determine if an impairment loss exists 
in october  we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of isc and determined the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the principal asset acquired was completed technology of million related to billing software solutions for the wireless marketplace as well as customer contracts of  in november  we acquired the assets of airada and determined the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the principal asset acquired was completed technology of million related to a payment management software solution for the wireless marketplace as well as customer contracts of  management determined the fair value of the assets acquired by considering the anticipated cash flows to be generated from the existing products  the valuation of customer relationships  the estimated life of the technology acquired and other assumptions 
the valuation of completed technology was primarily based on future cash flow projections over the estimated economic life adjusted for an incremental obsolescence rate discounted to present value 
we estimated that the useful life of the acquired technology is five years 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the fair market value of assets acquired and their useful lives 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 

table of contents income taxes our current and deferred income taxes  and associated tax reserves  are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with special and non recurring items 
assessment of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes is dependent on several factors  including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing of income tax payments 
actual collections and payments may materially differ from these estimates as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated future transactions impacting related income tax balances 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  statement r permits public companies to adopt the new requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt statement using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were  million  and  in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million compared to million at december   primarily due to cash generated by operations 
the net cash provided by operations of million resulted from million in net income  along with adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million and deferred income taxes of million 

table of contents our investing activities utilized million of net cash for the year ended december  we spent approximately million for the purchase of telecommunication equipment and software to enhance our managed services platform as well as further develop our licensed products and  to a lesser extent  for the renovation of our bedford  ma corporate headquarters 
in addition  we purchased million in short term investments  net of sales  million in purchases of long term investments and we acquired a business for approximately million 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately to million for the full year we expect to contribute approximately million to fund our defined benefit plan assets in the second quarter of  and we intend to continue to make such contributions for the foreseeable future 
we intend to finance such investments from our short term investments 
our financing activities used cash of million during primarily for the repurchase of million of common stock  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the corresponding issuance of common stock 
subject to the outcome of the freedom wireless lawsuit  we believe that our cash and short term investments will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
we have non cancelable operating lease commitments for office space and equipment  many of which are renewable at our option as well as various other commitments for equipment and telecommunications services under which we are contractually obligated beyond the current period 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payment due by period total within year years years more than years contractual obligations operating leases purchase commitments total off balance sheet arrangements during  we did not engage in material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or special purpose entities  material trading activities in non exchange traded commodity contracts  or material transactions with persons or entities that benefit from their non independent relationship with us 
certain factors that may affect future results verizon wireless and cingular wireless  our two largest customers using our real time billing managed services in  are currently also utilizing in house and or our competitors prepaid solutions  which will result in the continued loss of existing subscribers and fewer subscriber additions to our platform 
verizon wireless may terminate our existing prepaid wireless services agreement upon days written notice 
verizon wireless continues to convert subscribers from our platform to its internal platform  and is expected to be completed with conversions by the third quarter of in addition  because cingular wireless has substantially reduced marketing for our real time billing offering and begun offering prepaid service on their gsm network through one of our competitors  we expect that subscribers from cingular wireless tdma 
table of contents prepaid service that we currently support will churn off of our platform over time 
thus  revenues from verizon and cingular will substantially decrease  resulting in a reduction of overall revenue from our real time billing business from these two customers 
the loss or significant reduction of business from one of our major customers  including verizon wireless  cingular wireless or nextel communications  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period has been attributable to a limited number of customers in the wireless telecommunications business 
the following table summarizes the percentage of our total revenue received from verizon wireless  cingular wireless and nextel communications for the three and twelve months ended december  three months ended year ended verizon wireless cingular wireless nextel communications most of our customer contracts are not exclusive 
therefore  our wireless operator customers have used and or tested and continue to use and or test their own services or services of our competitors in certain markets 
in addition  certain of our contracts are up for renewal in and beyond 
if and when each of the contracts is renewed  some contractual rates may be lower than in previous years and at lower rates than we have estimated 
in addition  we depend on our wireless customers to market and sell our solutions to consumers 
we can provide no assurance that they will do so successfully  and therefore  that there will be a significant market for our mobile services platform 
as verizon and cingular revenues decline and if revenue generated from nextel continues to grow as expected  nextel will become our largest customer 
thus  our customer concentration may intensify and we can provide no assurance that nextel will continue to use our services beyond the term of their contract with us  which is not due to expire within the next year 
if we were to lose nextel as a customer and not replace the revenue  our business would be materially and adversely impacted 
an unfavorable judgment in the freedom wireless lawsuit would have a material adverse impact on our business 
in march  freedom wireless  inc filed a suit against us and a number of our wireless carrier customers claiming that we and the other defendants infringe a patent of freedom wireless 
in march  freedom wireless amended the complaint to include a continuation patent 
freedom wireless seeks injunctive relief and damages 
in addition  we are contractually obligated to indemnify the other defendants for any damages that they incur as a result of any infringement by our technology 
the trial began on february  we cannot yet assess our potential liability  if any 
any adverse outcome  including the following  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations injunctive relief against us  which could significantly restrict our ability to conduct our business  an adverse judgment against us for significant monetary damages  a settlement on unfavorable terms  obligations to the other defendants to indemnify them for damages  obligations to customers for breach of a contractual warranty of non infringement  and or a requirement to reengineer our prepaid processing solution to avoid patent infringement  which would likely result in additional expense and delay 

table of contents regardless of the outcome  we will continue to incur significant expenses to defend this lawsuit 
we have incurred approximately million in legal costs as of december  to defend this lawsuit  and expect to incur approximately to million in legal expenses in the first quarter of and  on average  million per quarter thereafter  until the freedom wireless matter is resolved 
however  this cost will likely continue to vary from quarter to quarter  depending on the timing of proceedings 
there can be no assurance that costs to defend the freedom wireless suit will not exceed our estimate 
freedom wireless is seeking damages in excess of million from us and the other remaining co defendants  who bcgi has agreed to indemnify 
if freedom wireless prevails in this case and is awarded the amount of damages which they are seeking from us and the other co defendants  this amount would exceed our ability to pay 
finally  we may become subject to additional patent infringement lawsuits in the future 
our future success depends partly on the global acceptance of our new products  including bcgi access management  payment manager and bcgi network 
we have recently introduced bcgi access management  payment manager and bcgi network product offerings to the marketplace 
the acceptance of these new products is critical to our strategy to diversify and grow our revenue base 
our success in gaining acceptance of these offerings will depend on our ability to integrate these products into existing wireless operator billing platforms 
in addition  the success of bcgi access management will depend on wireless operator and subscriber acceptance of the capabilities of this product 
the failure or delay of any of these offerings to be accepted in the marketplace could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate  which may result in significant fluctuations in our stock price 
we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and such fluctuations may continue and could intensify 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the lack of acceptance or delayed acceptance of our newest solutions  including bcgi access management and payment manager  decreased demand for our licensed solutions  caused by reductions in capital budgets of our customers  changing technologies and other reasons beyond our control  delays in recognizing revenue on any transaction  delays or deferrals of customer shipments and or implementations of our products  variations in volumes of minutes of use generated by our wireless customers subscribers  the number and significance of network outages in a particular quarter and the severity and timing of penalties that result from such outages  rates charged and paid by our customers  impact and acceptance of existing solutions or the introduction of competing solutions by wireless operators  including those who are currently our customers  our wireless customers ability to generate additional prepaid subscribers using our solutions  the extent of our wireless customers emphasis on promoting prepaid solutions and the timing of related marketing initiatives  including our wireless operators allocation of marketing resources for initiatives other than prepaid wireless services  such as data services  new technologies  etc  
table of contents our and our wireless customers ability to minimize churn the percentage of total prepaid subscribers that terminate service on our network  the relatively long sales cycles for many of our products  changes in the mix of solutions we provide  seasonal trends  particularly in the second and third quarters when wireless operators are not usually marketing and selling prepaid services as aggressively as in the first and fourth quarters of the year  and consolidation within the wireless industry  which could lead to the loss of a major customer or the reduction in rates per minute paid by our customers 
we expect that our revenues and net income will decline in future quarters  as verizon and cingular generate less revenue 
also  a significant portion of our expenses is fixed 
accordingly  our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
if our revenues fall below our expectations  we would most likely not be able to reduce our fixed or other expenses in time to sufficiently respond to such a shortfall 
additionally  due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter our results of operations will be below our expectations and or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not continue to develop and offer more desirable functionality and features in our solutions at competitive prices  including bcgi billing  bcgi access management  bcgi payment  bcgi network and the new solutions currently in our pipeline  we will not be able to compete effectively and our business will be materially and adversely affected 
our business will not be successful if we do not develop and offer more functionality and features in our solutions than those available in competitive offerings or if we are unable to develop new solutions to offer our wireless customers 
also  there can be no assurance that we will successfully support and enhance our real time billing platform effectively or that our network will successfully support current and future growth 
in addition  we may be unable to leverage our existing infrastructure to provide enhancements to our current solutions or new solutions cost effectively 
if we cannot develop and provide more desirable functionality and features than our competitors  if we cannot sell our new solutions  including bcgi access management  bcgi network or bcgi payment  or if we are unable to keep our costs down to provide new and enhanced solutions at competitive prices  we would likely lose market share or be required to reduce our pricing  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we do not successfully continue to upgrade our software and hosting environment as new wireless technologies evolve  including but not limited to g technology  we may lose existing and prospective customers 
our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
we are expanding our operations internationally and expect to derive a greater portion of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including general economic conditions in each country or region  the overlap of different tax regimes  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries  the difficulty of managing an organization operating in various countries  compliance with a variety of international laws and regulations  including trade restrictions  local labor ordinances and changes in tariff rates  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  import and export licensing requirements  
table of contents political unrest  terrorism and the potential for other hostilities  particularly in areas in which we have facilities  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and address these risks 
we cannot guarantee that these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or operating results 
if we experience outages in our network  we will be subject to financial penalties that could adversely affect our business and operating results 
each quarter  we have experienced network outages  some of which have resulted in significant reductions in revenue due to penalty clauses contained in certain of our wireless customer contracts 
any failure to successfully support current and future growth  or an increase in the frequency or duration of outages would reduce our revenue and damage our reputation 
our operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and other telecommunications equipment and systems in effective working order and to protect our systems against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  computer viruses or similar events 
our bedford and woburn  massachusetts facilities are redundant and each facility is able to provide all significant processing functions of our network 
we still may not be protected from a natural disaster within the greater boston  massachusetts area 
our business would be materially adversely impacted if we cannot protect our intellectual property 
our success and ability to compete depends in part upon our proprietary technology and our ability to protect such technology 
we have a number of patent applications pending to protect our proprietary technology in the united states and internationally 
if these patent applications are not approved  we may not be able to prevent others from using similar technologies and we may be subject to additional patent infringement lawsuits or royalty payments to use the technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures  and patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these legal protections afford only limited protection and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property that may result in the loss of customers 
in addition  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technology or to obtain and use our proprietary information 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources with no assurance of success and could seriously harm our business and operating results 
we may never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions 
a key part of our growth and diversification strategy is to engage in acquisitions 
we regularly review future acquisition opportunities and have acquired companies in the recent past 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify any appropriate acquisition candidates or that any identified acquisition opportunities will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  among other things possible decreases in capital resources or dilution to existing stockholders  difficulties and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions and the subsequent assimilation of the operations and the services or products of the acquired company  difficulties of operating a new business  potential inherited liability for the past actions of the acquired company  risk that any acquired company s internal controls may not be adequate  
table of contents diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  limited ability to predict future operating results of the acquired company  and potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company 
in the event that the operations of an acquired business do not meet expectations  we may be required to restructure the acquired business or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business 
there can be no assurance that any acquisition will be successfully integrated into our operations or will have the intended financial or strategic results 
we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our business  which would adversely impact our ability to offer competitive solutions and grow 
we have expanded our operations rapidly and continue to invest in new products and features  including expanding internationally 
this has created significant demands on our technical  management  operational  development and administrative personnel and other resources 
any additional expansion by us may further strain our management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that our systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of our operations or that we will be successful in our expansion strategy 
inability of our management to manage operational changes effectively  would materially and adversely affect the quality of our solutions  our ability to retain key personnel and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 
competition for employees with the skills we require is intense 
our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key employees  including members of the executive management team as well as those employees in crucial technical  marketing and staff positions 
the loss of one or more key employees  our inability to attract additional qualified employees  or the delay in hiring key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for our solutions is very competitive and depends on the growth and health of the wireless industry and wireless carriers 
we have historically provided our solutions almost exclusively to wireless carriers 
the market for solutions to wireless carriers is highly competitive and subject to rapid change as new technologies are continually introduced in the wireless marketplace 
we anticipate continued growth and competition in the wireless services industry and  consequently  the entrance of new competitors in the future 
our competitors include independent providers of prepaid and other solutions to wireless carriers and the wireless carriers themselves who provide  or can provide  in house services similar to ours 
these wireless carriers  and many of the independent service providers  have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  the wireless industry is subject to consolidation  which could potentially result in the loss of carrier customers and or subscribers 
competitive pressures may make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers and may require us to reduce the price of our service solutions 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position would limit our ability to retain and increase our market share  resulting in serious harm to our business and operating results 
to provide our solutions  we depend on a number of third party software  hardware and service vendors  and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if we are unable  or are delayed in our ability to obtain these components and applications 
our operations are supported by many hardware components and software applications from third party vendors  sometimes licensed from single vendors 
there can be no assurance that these vendors will continue to license these components and applications to us or that they will do so at reasonable prices 
in addition  there can 
table of contents be no assurance that these hardware components and software applications will function in accordance with specifications agreed upon by us and our vendors 
if we cannot obtain these components and applications from our existing vendors  we may not be able to timely procure or develop replacement software and hardware at commercially reasonable costs  or at all 
if we are unable to do so  we may be required to delay the development or sale of our current or future solutions  which would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business 
any significant system or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks 
all information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including but not limited to computer viruses  security breaches  natural disasters  terrorism  war and telecommunication failure 
there may also be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not installed properly 
we have implemented various measures to guard against these risks 
however  there can be no assurance that a system or network failure or significant disruption will not have a material adverse impact on our business and our operating results 
in addition  in the event of such a disruption or failure  we may incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by such a situation 
changes in government regulations could adversely impact our business 
proposals to intensify or reduce government regulations of the wireless telephone industry continue to be discussed at both the federal and state levels 
such changes may decrease the growth of the wireless telephone industry  result in new competitors or industry consolidation  limit the number of potential customers for our solutions or impede our ability to offer competitive solutions to the wireless market or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  since our investments are generally conservative in nature and are of a relatively short duration and some are held to maturity  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for either hedging foreign currency exposure risk or speculative trading purposes 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
