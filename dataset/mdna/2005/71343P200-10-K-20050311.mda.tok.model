in the caribbean  our territories include puerto rico  jamaica  barbados  the bahamas  and trinidad and tobago 
our key financial results worldwide average net selling prices improved percent  increasing net sales to billion in fiscal year worldwide volume declined percent in fiscal year  compared to the prior year  which included the lapping of the rd week 
the additional week contributed percent to the volume decline 
we increased gross margins by basis points to percent in fiscal year we generated operating income of million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the rd week contributed million to operating income in fiscal year we recorded net special charges of million in fiscal year  compared to net special charges of million in the prior year 
we generated cash from operating activities of million in fiscal year  which included a million benefit from our accounts receivable securitization program 
we reported diluted earnings per share of for the fiscal year  compared to diluted earnings per share of in the prior year 
our focus in we manage our business to optimize shareholder value through our focus on the balance between volume and pricing  improved cost performance  strong execution in the marketplace  and enhanced utilization of our international infrastructure 
the challenges and opportunities we faced in our geographic segments are summarized as follows in the us the most significant challenges we faced were volume declines in trademark pepsi and higher raw material costs 
us volume declined percent in  while trademark pepsi  which accounted for approximately percent of our total volume  declined in the mid single digits 
in addition  we experienced higher aluminum  resin and fuel costs in we were able to offset the effects of volume softness and higher raw material costs through our pricing initiatives 
for the second consecutive year  pricing drove our top line growth 
non carbonated and diet categories were the strongest contributors to volume in  while our core trademarks continued to be supported through innovative line extensions and our diet categories 
we addressed changing consumer preferences through our focus on our non carbonated beverages  water  and diet categories 
we successfully launched the tropicana flavor lines and capitalized on the popularity of aquafina water to drive sales 
we maintained our focus on higher margin single serve packages 
we completed the rollout of the fridge mate package  to ensure that we are competitive with this consumer preferred package 
additionally  pepsi connect  our dedicated call center in fargo  north dakota has positively impacted our business  specifically in the growth of our single serve package 
this call center allows us to provide service to smaller customers in a cost efficient manner 
lastly  we substantially completed our conversion to our next generation selling system in  which enabled us to increase distribution through the use of a dedicated sales team and decrease costs associated with handling products and optimize our delivery route structure 
upon conversion to our next generation selling system  we moved from a conventional route system to an upgraded pre sell system 
in the conventional route sales system  a route driver simultaneously takes the customer s order and delivers product to the customer 
in the pre sell environment  a dedicated sales person takes the customer s order and a delivery person subsequently delivers the pre determined order to the customer 
our international operations 
for the second consecutive year  we achieved profitability in our combined international operations due to our focus on pricing  managing costs  and leveraging our infrastructure 
in fiscal year  we generated a total of million in operating income in central europe and the caribbean  which included the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and approximately million in special charges 
this compares to operating income in our international operations of million in fiscal year  which included net special charges of million 
in the past  profitability in our international operations has been a challenge due to macroeconomic and political conditions  as well as the competitive environments in which we operate 
these challenges still exist  particularly the strong competition in our markets due to pricing pressures from existing competitors on our core and lower cost brands  as well as the entry of new competitors into our markets 
in central europe  we were faced with the additional challenges of the accession of our markets into the european union in upon entry into the eu  volume was negatively impacted by the temporary compression of consumers disposable income as a result of higher retail prices for many consumer goods 
as the economy began to stabilize  we saw a gradual recovery with improved volume trends in central europe in the second half of the year 
volume declined percent in the second quarter  percent in the third quarter  and percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  for an overall volume decline of percent for fiscal year we increased pricing in late and early in anticipation of higher sugar costs  as a result of the entry of our markets into the eu 
in addition  we experienced higher resin costs 
operating income improved in fiscal year to million in central europe  compared to million in  despite the immediate challenges of the entry of our markets into the eu  due to our higher net pricing  our continued efforts to rationalize our operations to achieve improved cost performance  and our product portfolio expansion 
our higher net pricing strategy and focus on promotions helped to offset some of the effects of the volume declines and higher raw material costs 
our efforts to migrate to an alternative sales and distribution system in central europe in certain territories was substantially completed during fiscal year this strategy involves the use of third party distributors in the less densely populated rural areas  and is expected to result in estimated annual cost savings of approximately million 
in addition  early in fiscal year  we implemented a standard organization structure in central europe to reduce redundancies and streamline operations  which resulted in a headcount reduction and expected annual cost savings of approximately million 
furthermore  in the fourth quarter of  we consolidated certain production lines in poland and finalized plans to further consolidate production lines and facilities in hungary and republic of slovakia in the first quarter of we also plan to reduce our headcount in our central european headquarters and record a special charge accordingly  in the first quarter of once completed  these programs are expected to drive annual cost savings between million and million 
in addition  our top line benefited from the expansion of our product portfolio in  including our introduction of tropicana juice  lipton iced tea and gatorade in selected markets  and the distribution of frito lay snack foods in the czech republic 
in the caribbean  we continue to be challenged by the unique competitive environment  and the macroeconomic and political conditions that exist at each location 
in addition  in  we overcame the challenges of a very active hurricane season 
despite these challenges  operating income in the caribbean grew by million to million in  due to solid execution of our initiatives 
in  we drove strong top line growth through our continued expansion of our product portfolio and of our export sales in jamaica 
in addition  we leveraged our infrastructure with the distribution of frito lay products in trinidad and tobago 
focusing on in looking ahead to  we are focused on continuing to drive top line growth and finding an appropriate balance between volume and price 
pricing  with a focus on both rate and mix  continues to be a driving factor in achieving our top line growth 
our plans include increased emphasis on volume with an emphasis on the growth categories based on the continued shift in consumer demands and increased interest in products related to health and wellness  including non carbonated beverages  energy drinks  water  and diet categories 
in addition  we continue to focus on the single serve  immediate consumption business across all channels and products 
we continue to focus on product and product line expansion  as well as packaging innovation 
volume should benefit from our innovation calendar and product line extensions and enhancements  in particular in the us we are in the process of rolling out aquafina flavor splash and aquafina sparkling in our us markets to bring expansion to the water category  and appeal to those consumers who want a greater choice of water 
in fiscal year  we plan to rollout a new reformulated wild cherry pepsi  and pepsione will be enhanced with the new sweetening product  splenda 
our new packaging will include ounce  pack cans and ounce pet multi pack packages 
in addition  we will build on the growing demand for non carbonated beverages by extending the tropicana line with both regular and sugar free tropicana orangeade  and we will now compete with the wider portfolio in the tea category at all price points 
in central europe and the caribbean  we seek to continue to grow our top line through the utilization of our existing infrastructure  which includes the distribution of frito lay snack foods in selected markets in an effort to increase our relevancy to our customers 
in addition  we have introduced the slice trademark into all four markets in central europe 
lastly  we plan to grow our top line through the integration of central investment corporation cic  which we acquired in january this acquisition provides opportunities for incremental growth  and complements our existing markets in ohio and gives us a presence in florida  which currently has a higher population growth than our other markets and provides an opportunity to gain market share 
we expect this acquisition to be accretive to earnings per share in in  we expect to achieve diluted earnings per share of to  a growth of approximately to percent on an as reported basis  compared to diluted earnings per share of 
this includes the expected per share accretive impact of the cic acquisition 
on a constant territory basis  we expect worldwide volume to increase in the range of to percent and to improve average net selling price by to percent 
cost of goods sold per unit is expected to increase to percent  and selling  delivery and administrative expenses are expected to be higher by to percent compared to overall  we expect to generate operating income growth on a constant territory basis of to percent  excluding special charges 
our success in achieving operating income growth  combined with our efforts in driving lower borrowing costs and effectively managing our capital spending  drove adjusted operating cash flow of million in fiscal year our ability to generate significant adjusted operating cash flow makes available several options  including increasing our dividends  repurchasing stock  investing in the business and pursuing acquisitions with appropriate economic returns 
we continue to examine the optimal uses of cash 
the above overview should not be considered by itself in determining full disclosure  and should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k 
the following discussion and analysis includes six major categories critical accounting policies  related party transactions  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  recently issued accounting pronouncements  and discussion of our market risks which appears in item a 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in our results for the period in which the actual amounts or revisions become known 
presented in our notes to the consolidated financial statements is a summary of our most significant accounting policies used in the preparation of such statements 
significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements include goodwill impairment  environmental liabilities  income taxes and casualty insurance costs which are described in further detail below goodwill impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  using a two step approach at the reporting unit level us  central europe and the caribbean 
first  we estimate the fair value of the reporting units primarily using discounted estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the potential loss 
goodwill impairment is measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
the impairment evaluation requires the use of considerable management judgment to determine the fair value of the reporting units using discounted future cash flows  including estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of cash flows  cost of capital and growth rates 
environmental liabilities 
we continue to be subject to certain indemnification obligations under agreements related to previously sold subsidiaries  including potential environmental liabilities see environmental matters in item and note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have recorded our best estimate of our probable liability under those indemnification obligations with the assistance of outside consultants and other professionals 
the estimated indemnification liabilities include expenses for the remediation of identified sites  payments to third parties for claims and expenses including product liability and toxic tort claims  administrative expenses  and the expenses of on going evaluations and litigation 
such estimates and the recorded liabilities are subject to various factors  including possible insurance recoveries  the allocation of liabilities among other potentially responsible parties  the advancement of technology for means of remediation  possible changes in the scope of work at the contaminated sites  as well as possible changes in related laws  regulations  and agency requirements 
we do not discount environmental liabilities 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect management s best estimate of the outcome of future tax audits 
we have established valuation allowances against substantially all of the non us net operating losses to reflect the uncertainty of our ability to fully utilize these benefits given the limited carryforward periods permitted by the various jurisdictions 
the evaluation of the realizability of our net operating losses requires the use of considerable management judgment to estimate the future taxable income for the various jurisdictions  for which the ultimate amounts and timing of such estimates may differ 
the valuation allowance can also be impacted by changes in the tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in determining our contingent tax liabilities 
we have established contingent tax liabilities using management s best judgment and adjust these liabilities as warranted by changing facts and circumstances 
a change in our tax liabilities in any given period could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows for that period 
casualty insurance costs 
due to the nature of our business  we require insurance coverage for certain casualty risks 
we are self insured for workers compensation  product and general liability up to million per occurrence and automobile liability up to million per occurrence 
the casualty insurance costs for our self insurance program represent the ultimate net cost of all reported and estimated unreported losses incurred during the fiscal year 
we do not discount casualty insurance liabilities 
our liability for casualty costs is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are based on the best data available to us 
these estimates  however  are also subject to a significant degree of inherent variability  including the relatively recent increases in medical costs 
we evaluate these estimates with our actuarial advisors on an annual basis and we believe that they are appropriate and within acceptable industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the estimates or economic events outside our control could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of these costs may vary significantly from the estimates included in our consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions transactions with pepsico pepsico is considered a related party due to the nature of our franchise relationship and pepsico s ownership interest in us

our purchases from such other bottlers in fiscal years   and were not material 
results of operations in the discussions of our results of operations below  the number of cases sold is referred to as volume

items impacting comparability fiscal year 
our us operations report using a fiscal year that ends on the saturday closest to december and as a result  a rd week is added every five to six years 
fiscal years and consisted of weeks ended on january  and december   respectively 
fiscal year consisted of weeks ended on january  our central europe and caribbean operations fiscal years end on december st and therefore were not impacted by the rd week in the following table illustrates the approximate dollars in millions and percentage points of growth that the incremental week contributed to our operating results dollars percentage points net sales gross profit selling  delivery and administrative expenses operating income impact of emerging issues task force issue no 
in the first quarter of  we prospectively adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf issue no 
concludes that certain consideration received by a customer from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the price of the vendor s products  and therefore  should be recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold when recognized in the customer s income statement  unless certain criteria are met 
this presumption is overcome if the consideration paid to the customer is directly attributable offsetting to incremental and separately identifiable expenses incurred elsewhere in the income statement 
prior to the adoption of eitf issue no 
 bottler incentives marketing support programs from brand owners were recognized as an increase to net sales or as a reduction in sd a expenses based on the objectives of the programs and initiatives 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we recorded certain bottler incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold beginning in the first quarter of to properly account for new agreements 
bottler incentives that are directly attributable to incremental expenses incurred are reported as either an increase to net sales or a reduction to sd a expenses  commensurate with the recognition of the related expense 
all other bottler incentives are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related products are sold based on the agreements with vendors 
assuming that eitf issue no 
had been in place at the beginning of fiscal year  the following adjustments would have been made to our fiscal year reported results in millions net sales as reported  eitf issue no

adjustment adjusted comparison  sd a expenses as reported eitf issue no 
adjustment adjusted comparison  operating results compared with volume 
sales volume growth declines for and were as follows us central europe caribbean worldwide in  worldwide volume decreased percent compared to the prior year  mainly attributable to volume declines of percent in the us and percent in central europe partially offset by caribbean volume growth of percent 
the decline in worldwide volume for the year was mainly due to the lapping of the rd week in in the us  lower volumes in our core pepsi trademark  and the impact of the entry of our markets into the eu in may the decline in us volume of percent in fiscal year reflected the lapping of the rd week in and continued softness in our pepsi and mountain dew brands  partially offset by high single digit volume growth in our non carbonated beverage portfolio 
the lapping of the incremental rd week contributed percent to the us volume decline in fiscal year trademark pepsi experienced mid single digit declines  driven mainly by lower volumes in brand pepsi  offset  in part  by continued strength in the diet pepsi brands and growth from product innovation during fiscal year volume in trademark mountain dew was relatively flat in compared to the prior year  driven by growth in brand diet mountain dew and the introduction of mountain dew pitch black during the third quarter of  offset by the impact of lapping our mountain dew livewire product launch in the first quarter of trademark pepsi and trademark mountain dew comprise approximately percent of our total volume 
non carbonated beverage growth was driven by double digit growth in aquafina volume and the introduction of tropicana juice drinks in february volume in central europe decreased percent during fiscal year this decline was driven primarily by market wide increases in costs related to the accession of our markets into the eu  including increases in retailer prices  higher raw material costs  increased value added taxes and higher utility costs as a result of privatization of those industries 
we also experienced cold weather conditions in the late spring and early summer that negatively impacted volume 
despite these challenges  the rate of volume decline slowed with each sequential quarter since the accession to the eu  and we expect this improvement in volume to continue into fiscal year in central europe  carbonated soft drinks account for approximately percent of total volume  while the water category and other non carbonated beverages comprise our remaining volume 
our carbonated soft drink business declined in the low double digits driven primarily by a high single digit volume decline in trademark pepsi and double digit volume declines in other carbonated soft drinks 
our water category experienced double digit volume declines during fiscal year despite successful promotional activity in the first quarter 
volume in the caribbean increased percent compared to the same period last year  primarily driven by the percent volume contribution from the consolidation of the bahamas 
the volume growth of for the remainder of the caribbean was mainly driven by volume growth in puerto rico  offset by volume declines in jamaica as a result of higher pricing 
the introduction of the essential water brand contributed to the volume growth  as well as our continued expansion of our product portfolio 
net sales 
net sales and net pricing statistics for and were as follows dollar amounts in millions net sales change us   central europe caribbean worldwide   net pricing growth decline us central europe caribbean worldwide net sales in increased million  or percent  to  million compared to  million in the percent increase in worldwide net sales primarily reflected an increase in net average selling prices in all three geographic segments  offset  in part  by the impact of volume declines in both the us and central europe 
net sales in the us in fiscal year increased million  or percent  to  million from  million in the prior year 
this increase occurred despite the lapping of the incremental rd week  which contributed million to net sales in fiscal year the increase in us net sales was the result of improved net selling prices of percent  which offset the impact of the lower volumes in the improvement in net pricing was driven by rate increases of approximately percent and package mix contribution of percent 
the top line growth has been driven by our continued focus on our single serve packages and our disciplined approach to pricing across all geographic segments  as well as strong contributions from our non carbonated beverage category  most notably double digit growth in aquafina and the introduction of tropicana juice drinks 
net sales in central europe decreased million  or percent  to million in from million in the prior year 
the decrease resulted from a volume decrease of percent  which was partially offset by a percent increase in net pricing  aided by the impact of foreign currency translation 
foreign currency translation contributed million to net sales  which accounted for approximately percent of the net pricing growth in fiscal year as a result of the cost pressures associated with our markets accession into the eu  we increased our net pricing starting in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of promotional efforts in the first quarter of enabled us to maintain volume while we continued to maintain pricing during this period 
the reduction of these promotional activities after the first quarter of and the impact of the accession of our markets into the eu contributed to the decreases in volume during the balance of fiscal year  as consumers were impacted by the higher price points on many consumer products 
customers appeared to be adjusting to the higher pricing during the balance of the year  as the rate of volume declines slowed with each sequential quarter in caribbean net sales increased million  or percent  to million in compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in net sales resulted from the million contribution from the consolidation of the bahamas beginning in the first quarter of the remainder of the increase in net sales was mainly due to the increase in net pricing in puerto rico  jamaica  and trinidad and tobago 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for and were as follows dollar amounts in millions change us   central europe caribbean worldwide   cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to  million compared to  million last year 
the increase was driven primarily by higher raw material costs  as worldwide cost of goods sold per unit increased percent during fiscal year the primary drivers of the increase in raw material costs were increases in aluminum and resin costs 
in the us  cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to  million from  million in in fiscal year  the rd week resulted in an additional million in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold per unit increased percent in the us  primarily driven by price increases in aluminum and resin 
we were able to mitigate  in part  the increase in aluminum costs with our hedging program 
in addition  concentrate costs  which represent approximately percent of total product costs in the us  were higher as pepsico concentrate prices increased on average by approximately percent beginning in february in central europe  cost of goods sold decreased million  or percent  to million compared to million in the previous year 
this decrease was primarily due to volume declines of percent  offset by higher raw material costs and the million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 
higher sugar prices after the accession of our markets into the eu  as well as higher resin costs  contributed to the percent increase in cost of goods sold per unit during fiscal year in the caribbean  cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to million compared to million in  driven mainly by the consolidation of the bahamas beginning in the first quarter of which contributed more than half of the increase in cost of goods sold 
the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in volume of percent for the remainder of the caribbean and a higher cost of goods sold per unit  primarily due to higher operating costs 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses for and were as follows dollar amounts in millions change us central europe caribbean worldwide   in  sd a expenses increased million  or percent  to  million from  million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  sd a expenses increased to percent in  compared to percent in in the us  sd a expenses increased million to million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
in fiscal year  the rd week resulted in an incremental million of sd a expenses

sd a expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to percent in fiscal year  compared to percent in the prior year 
the decrease in sd a expenses can be mainly attributed to cost savings related to our efforts to better leverage our infrastructure  including the completion of our migration to an alternative sales and distribution strategy in the rural areas in central europe  and the implementation of a standard organization structure  which reduced headcount and streamlined operations 
sd a expenses in the caribbean increased million to million in  compared to million in this increase was mainly due to the incremental sd a costs of million due to the consolidation of the bahamas in the first quarter of  as well as higher operating costs in puerto rico 
special charges 
during  we recorded special charges  net  of million in central europe  as we continued to rationalize our infrastructure to better fit our business model and the changing market conditions  including the accession of our markets into the eu 
the special charges included a charge of million  primarily for severance costs and related benefits  related to a reduction in the workforce in central europe as a result of the standardization of the organizational structure in all countries and is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately million 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a special charge of million related to the consolidation of certain production lines and facilities in poland and hungary  as we take advantage of the opportunities that now exist with the entry of our markets into the eu to improve the efficiencies of our supply chain in central europe 
this special charge consisted primarily of asset write downs and the acceleration of depreciation 
this charge was net of a million reversal recorded in the fourth quarter of due to revisions of estimates of certain liabilities related to previous special charges  as we substantially completed the plans to modify our distribution strategy in all of our markets in central europe 
we anticipate additional special charges of approximately million in the first half of related to continued consolidation of production lines in republic of slovakia and functional realignment of our organizational structure as a result of changing market conditions 
we anticipate these plans  collectively  will result in annual savings in central europe in the range of million to million once such plans noted above are completed

operating income in our international operations was million in fiscal year  compared to million in the prior year 
operating income in central europe increased million to million in  compared to million in the prior year 
foreign currency translation contributed approximately million to the operating income growth in  which helped to partially offset higher raw material costs and the impact of lower volumes 
we continued to achieve efficiencies and lower sd a costs in local currency as a result of our new alternatives sales and distribution system and other cost reduction efforts 
in the caribbean  operating income increased million to million in  compared to million in the prior year 
the operating income improvement in the caribbean was primarily due to higher net pricing  reflecting strong single serve and liter pricing 
operating income in included million of losses from the consolidation of the bahamas beginning in the first quarter 
interest and other expenses 
interest expense  net  decreased million to million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
this decrease was due to lower borrowing costs in due  in part  to financing activities and lower debt levels 
interest expense  net in fiscal year includes million of interest income related to a state income tax refund and the settlement of various income tax audits 
included in interest expense  net  in fiscal year was a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of million  offset  in part  by a million increase in interest income due to the favorable resolution of a tax refund case related to our previous esop 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we recorded other income  net  of million in compared to other expense  net  of million reported in included in other income  net  in was a gain of million related to the sale of a parcel of land in downtown chicago in the gain reflected the settlement and final payment on the promissory note related to the initial land sale  for which we had previously provided a full allowance 
in  we recorded an additional gain of million on the same land sale related to the favorable resolution of certain contingencies

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the significant items recorded in income taxes 
net income 
net income increased million to million in  compared to million in the factors affecting the improved performance were previously discussed 
operating results compared with volume 
sales volume growth declines for and were as follows us central europe caribbean worldwide in  worldwide volume decreased percent compared to the prior year  mainly attributable to volume declines of percent in the us and percent in central europe offset by caribbean volume growth of percent 
the decline in worldwide volumes for the year was mainly due to the weak performance in the first quarter of in the us and central europe  the continued impact of lower single serve package volumes  and the impact of volume declines in trademark pepsi and trademark mountain dew  offset partially by the percent incremental benefit of the rd week 
however  volume declines slowed throughout ending the year with an increase in worldwide volume of percent in the fourth quarter and an increase in us volume of percent in the fourth quarter 
fourth quarter volume growth also benefited from the incremental rd week 
the decline in us volume of percent in fiscal year  which included a percent benefit from the rd week  reflected the weak performance in the first quarter of  as well as continued softness in single serve package volume and trademark pepsi and trademark mountain dew  as consumer demands shifted and higher net selling prices were maintained 
we experienced softness across all channels  including continued volume declines in the small format channel 
from a brand perspective  the decline in us volume included mid single digit declines in trademark pepsi  driven mainly by lower volumes in brand pepsi  offset  in part  by the introduction of pepsi vanilla in the third quarter of the low single digit declines in trademark mountain dew reflected lower volumes in brand mountain dew  offset  in part  by the introduction of livewire in the second quarter of and volume increases in diet mountain dew 
trademark pepsi and trademark mountain dew comprise almost percent of our total volume 
during  we continued to achieve growth in sierra mist and trademark lipton 
trademark aquafina volumes were relatively flat compared to the same period in the prior year 
total volume in central europe decreased percent during fiscal year  and reflected volume declines in all four countries 
volume declined year over year in central europe due to several factors  including continued competitive pressures in the water and carbonated soft drink categories and poor weather conditions in the first quarter of in certain markets 
in central europe  carbonated soft drinks account for approximately percent of total volume  while the water category comprises approximately percent of our volume 
a new market entrant in the value priced water segment negatively impacted our volume trends as we maintained our pricing structure 
overall  we maintained a similar disciplined pricing structure in central europe as we have in the us  despite the competitive pressures  which negatively impacted our volume trends  but positively contributed to our operating profit 
total volume in the caribbean increased percent compared to the prior year primarily reflecting volume improvements in puerto rico and trinidad and tobago 
net sales 
net sales and net pricing statistics for and were as follows dollar amounts in millions net sales change us   central europe caribbean worldwide   net pricing growth decline us central europe caribbean worldwide net sales in decreased million  or percent  to  million compared to  million in the decrease in net sales was due primarily to the adoption of eitf issue no 
in fiscal year  offset by the incremental benefit of the rd week of million in the us had we adopted eitf issue no 
in fiscal year  net sales for fiscal year would have been million lower than reported 
the remainder of the decrease in worldwide net sales primarily reflected volume declines in both the us and central europe  offset partially by an increase in worldwide net average selling prices of percent  driven by increased pricing in the us and central europe and favorable exchange rates in central europe 
in addition  our caribbean operations contributed positively to net sales growth in net sales in the us in decreased million to  million from  million in the prior year 
net sales were impacted by the incremental benefit of million from the rd week and the adoption of eitf issue no 
in fiscal year had we adopted eitf issue no 
in fiscal year  net sales in the us for fiscal year would have been million lower than reported 
the remainder of the decrease in us net sales was the result of lower volumes in versus  offset partly by an improved net selling price per unit of percent 
the improvement in net pricing was driven by price increases of approximately percent and a package mix contribution of percent 
a favorable change in our can mix  including the eight ounce cans introduced in the fourth quarter of  as well as a reversal in declining trends in our ounce single serve business in the fourth quarter of  contributed to the positive mix impact 
net sales in central europe increased million  or percent  to million in from million in the prior year 
the increase was attributed to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates of approximately million and an increase in net pricing  offset by the impact of the percent volume declines 
net sales in compared to the same period in the prior year were also negatively impacted by lower co packing revenue in the czech republic in of approximately million due to new packaging legislation in germany 
this new legislation negatively impacted the sales of products in returnable bottles due to deposit requirements 
caribbean net sales increased percent to million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in net sales resulted mainly from volume growth of percent and increased net pricing in puerto rico and trinidad  offset  in part  by jamaica s decline in net pricing due  in part  to unfavorable foreign exchange rates

in fiscal year  cost of goods sold in the us for fiscal year would have been million lower than reported 
we experienced increases in cost of goods sold per unit in the us  which reflected higher concentrate costs and increased costs related to product mix 
more of our products are being sold in non returnable pet packages versus can packages  which is a trend we expect to continue 
concentrate prices from pepsico beginning in february were approximately percent higher than the prior year 
in central europe  cost of goods sold decreased million  or percent  to million compared to million in the previous year 
the decrease was due primarily to the impact of the adoption of eitf issue no 
in fiscal year had we adopted eitf issue no 
in fiscal year  cost of goods sold in central europe for fiscal year would have been million lower than reported 
the remainder of the decrease was due to a volume decline of percent and lower costs related to the decline in the german co packing business in the czech republic  partly offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately million 
in the caribbean  cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to million compared to million in  driven mainly by the increase in volume of percent and unfavorable foreign exchange rates in jamaica  offset  in part  by a lower cost of goods sold per unit

special charges 
during fiscal year  we recorded special charges  net  of million  including the million charge  net  in the us related to the reduction in workforce  and net charges of million related to the changes in the production  marketing and distribution strategies in our international operations 
the us special charge  net  of million consisted mainly of severance related costs  including the acceleration of restricted stock awards  associated with the announced reduction in our us workforce in the first quarter of during fiscal year  we recorded special charges of million in central europe related to the modification of the distribution method in poland  the czech republic  and republic of slovakia  offset by a million reversal of special charges recorded in the third quarter of related to the favorable outcomes associated with lease obligations and severance payments 
in the caribbean  we recorded special charges of million that consisted mainly of asset write downs related to the shutdown of the barbados manufacturing facility 
similar to the distribution changes we are making in central europe  we have rationalized our operation in barbados 
we are now outsourcing our distribution through a local partner and sourcing production from another manufacturing location we operate 
operating income 
operating income for and was as follows dollar amounts in millions change us central europe caribbean worldwide calculation of percentage change is not meaningful 
operating income increased million  or percent  to million compared to million in  driven mainly by an increase in operating income in our international operations of million 
the significant factors impacting us operating income in were the improvements in net pricing and the million contribution from the rd week  offset  in part  by a special charge  net  of million related to the reduction in the us workforce and the impact of volume declines and slightly higher sd a expenses as a percentage of net sales 
for the first time  we achieved operating profitability in our combined international operations in fiscal year operating income in our international operations was million in fiscal year  compared to a combined operating loss of million in the prior year 
operating income in central europe increased million to million in  compared to a loss of million in the prior year  while  in the caribbean  operating income increased million to million in  compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
approximately million of the caribbean improvement in operating income was related to a change in estimate regarding the lives of certain fixed assets 
historically  the profitability of our international operations had been a challenge 
the infrastructure of our central europe and caribbean operations anticipated a certain growth in market share for pepsico branded products  however  the competitive environment  stronger than anticipated preferences to local branded products  as well as the overall macroeconomic and political conditions did not allow us to generate sufficient volume and revenue growth to cover the operating costs present in our current distribution infrastructures 
over the past several years  we addressed the lack of profitability in our international operations in several ways 
in central europe  first  we expanded the portfolio of products we distribute beyond carbonated soft drink brands owned by pepsico and cadbury schweppes 
in  we acquired a local brand in central europe  toma  which allowed for the distribution of juices  still drinks and water under the toma brand to leverage our existing infrastructure 
second  we modified our distribution method in central europe beginning in from a conventional direct store delivery model to an alternative model using distributors in rural areas 
this change both expanded our revenue by increasing our points of contact with the end customer and reduced costs 
as it relates to the caribbean markets  we have better leveraged our infrastructure in the caribbean in several ways  including the outsourcing of production for barbados from an already existing manufacturing location and the utilization of a third party distributor beginning in  as well as expanding our portfolio of products for distribution in trinidad and tobago  including frito lay snack foods 
interest and other expenses 
net interest expense in was million  compared to million in the prior year 
included in net interest expense during was a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of million  offset  in part  by a million increase in interest income due to the favorable resolution of a tax refund case related to our previous employee stock ownership plan esop  both recorded in the first quarter 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition  our borrowing costs benefited from overall lower interest rates  a slight shift in our fixed and floating rate debt mix with approximately percent of our total debt being fixed and the remaining floating  and the refinancing of a portion of our fixed rate debt in the first quarter of we recorded other expense  net of million in compared to other expense  net of million reported in included in other expense  net in was a pretax gain of million resulting from the sale of a parcel of land in downtown chicago 
in  we recorded an additional gain on the same land sale of million related to the reduction of certain accruals due to the favorable resolution of related contingencies 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate  which is income tax expense expressed as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes  was percent in compared to percent in several significant items impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal year we recorded additional tax accruals of million  million of tax benefit related to the favorable tax settlement associated with our previous esop in the first quarter  and a net reversal of tax accruals of million related primarily to the conclusion of various income tax audits through the tax year 
collectively  these significant items for fiscal year reduced our effective income tax rate by approximately percent 
the further reduction in our effective income tax rate  compared to the effective income tax rate in  was due primarily to a lower effective state income tax rate in the us see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the significant items recorded in income taxes 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase can mainly be attributed to the increase in the operating profit performance of our international operations of million  the impact of the rd week in the us operations of million  lower borrowing costs resulting from lower interest rates  and the realization of certain tax benefits 
net income 
net income increased million to million in  compared to million in the factors affecting the improved performance were previously discussed 
in addition  net income in was reduced by a charge to discontinued operations of million after taxes 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased by million to million in  compared to million in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year can be mainly attributed to our million improvement in net income to million in and the increase in our accounts receivable securitization program 
in fiscal year  we increased our securitized receivables by million compared to the reduction of sales into our accounts receivable securitization program by million in fiscal year these cash inflows in fiscal year were offset by cash outflows from primary working capital of million mainly due to the increase in accounts receivable and decrease in accounts payable 
primary working capital is comprised of inventory  accounts payable and accounts receivable  excluding securitized receivables 
significant cash outlays for operating activities included our contribution of million to our pension plan in fiscal year and million in fiscal year we expect to fund a comparable amount to our pension plan in fiscal year as was contributed in we are million underfunded in our pension plans as of the end of fiscal year we do not believe that any known trends or uncertainties related to our pension plan will result in a material change in our results of operations  financial condition  or our liquidity 
investing activities 
investing activities during included capital investments of million  down million from capital investments of million in capital spending in decreased due to lower spending on vending equipment  coolers  machinery and equipment  and fleet 
the lower spending was partly attributable to improved capital discipline and full utilization of our vending refurbishment capability 
these reductions were offset by increased spending in for the completion of the rollout of our next generation selling system 
capital spending in  excluding potential acquisitions  is expected to be in the range of million to million

in the third quarter of  we made a million payment to gemcorp for  shares of cabcorp stock 
pursuant to the agreement and subject to certain performance requirements by gemcorp  we will make two additional payments  each for million in consideration for  shares

in the first quarter of  we issued million of notes due in march with a coupon rate of percent 
net proceeds from these notes were million  which reflected the reduction for discount and issuance costs totaling million  as well as a treasury rate lock settlement payment of million 
the proceeds were used to redeem million of notes that were issued in march in february  the investors of the million of notes issued in march notified us that they wanted to exercise their option to purchase and remarket the notes pursuant to the remarketing agreement  unless we elected to redeem the notes 
in march  we redeemed the notes pursuant to the agreement 
we paid approximately million for the fair value of the debt to be extinguished  net of the reverse treasury rate lock settlement of million 
in addition  we repaid the million percent notes that came due during the first quarter of we have a revolving credit agreement with maximum borrowings of million  which acts as back up for our commercial paper program 
accordingly  we have a total of million available under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility combined 
we had million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings as of the end of fiscal year  compared to million at the end of fiscal year in august  we announced that we would resume purchasing our common stock under a previously authorized repurchase program 
in december  the board authorized an additional million shares for our repurchase program 
as of fiscal year end  million shares remained available for repurchase under the authorization 
during fiscal year  we executed an accelerated stock repurchase program in which we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
during fiscal year  after the completion of the accelerated stock repurchase program  we repurchased an additional million shares of our common stock for million 
during fiscal year  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for million 
in addition  during we paid million relating to treasury stock purchases that were unsettled and included in other accrued expenses at the end of in the consolidated balance sheet 
beginning in fiscal year  our board of directors instituted a practice of reviewing dividend declarations on a quarterly basis 
the board declared quarterly dividends of per share on pepsiamericas common stock for each quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  we paid cash dividends of million based on four quarterly dividends of per share 
during fiscal year  we paid cash dividends of million based on one annual dividend of per share 
on february   we announced that our board of directors declared a first quarter dividend of per share on pepsiamericas common stock 
the dividend is payable april  to shareholders of record on march  we believe that our operating cash flows are sufficient to fund our existing operations for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we believe that our operating cash flows  available lines of credit  and the potential for additional debt and equity offerings will provide sufficient resources to fund our future growth and expansion 
there are a number of options available to us and we continue to examine the optimal uses of our cash  including increasing dividends  repurchasing stock and investing in the business or acquisitions  assuming a high economic return 
in january  we completed the acquisition of the capital stock of cic  which was the seventh largest pepsi bottler in the us  for a purchase price of million plus an adjustment for working capital 
in addition  we issued million of notes in january with a coupon rate of percent due january  the proceeds of the january debt issuance were used to fund the acquisition of cic 
the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of the end of fiscal year  by due date 
long term debt obligations do not include amounts related to the fair value adjustment from interest rate swaps and unamortized discount premium 
our short term and long term debt  lease commitments  purchase obligations and advertising and exclusivity rights are more fully described in notes  and  respectively  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our interest obligations relate to our contractual obligations under our fixed rate long term debt 
payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter commercial paper and notes payable long term obligations  interest obligations advertising commitments and exclusivity rights raw material purchase obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total contractual cash obligations  discontinued operations 
we continue to be subject to certain indemnification obligations  net of insurance  under agreements related to previously sold subsidiaries  including indemnification expenses for potential environmental and tort liabilities of these prior subsidiaries 
there is significant uncertainty in assessing our potential expenses for complying with our indemnification obligations  as the determination of such amounts is subject to various factors  including possible insurance recoveries and the allocation of liabilities among other potentially responsible and financially viable parties 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement and timing of cash requirements related to such indemnification obligations may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements 
at the end of fiscal year  we had recorded million in liabilities for future remediation and other costs arising out of our indemnification obligations 
this amount excludes possible insurance recoveries and is determined on an undiscounted cash flow basis 
in addition  we have funded coverage pursuant to an insurance policy purchased in fiscal year see finite funding discussion in environmental matters in item  which reduces the cash required to be paid by us for certain environmental sites pursuant to our indemnification obligations 
the finite funding amount recorded was million at the end of fiscal year  of which million is expected to be received in based on our expenditures  and is thus  included as a current asset in the consolidated balance sheet 
during fiscal years and  we paid approximately million and million  respectively  related to such indemnification obligations  net of insurance settlements of million and million  respectively  as well as the benefit of taxes 
we expect to spend approximately million to million in fiscal year for remediation and other related costs  excluding possible insurance recoveries

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment 
among its provisions  sfas r will require us to measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize the cost over the requisite service period 
sfas r becomes effective for us beginning in the third quarter of as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we currently use the intrinsic value method to account for stock based employee compensation 
as a result  adoption of sfas r is expected to reduce our net income in interim and annual periods after adoption 
we believe the best indication of the approximate impact of adopting the provisions of sfas r may be determined by reviewing note to the consolidated financial statements 
this note shows that net income would have decreased by  and per diluted share for fiscal years  and  respectively 
also  upon adoption we will be allowed to  but not required to  restate prior interim periods or prior years in accordance with a prescribed modified retrospective method 
we have not yet determined whether we will restate prior periods 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility  freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
becomes effective for us beginning in fiscal year we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued staff position fsp fas no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp no 
clarifies sfas no 
s guidance that applies to the new tax deduction for qualified domestic production activities 
fsp no 
became effective upon issuance and we believe this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are subject to various market risks  including risks from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
commodity prices 
the risk from commodity price changes relates to our ability to recover higher product costs through price increases to customers  which may be limited due to the competitive pricing environment that exists in the soft drink business 
we use derivative financial instruments to hedge price fluctuations for a portion of anticipated purchases of certain commodities used in our operations  including aluminum  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
because of the high correlation between such commodity prices and our cost of these products  we consider these hedges to be highly effective 
at the end of  we have hedged a portion of our anticipated aluminum can and natural gas purchases through november  while we have hedged a portion of our anticipated diesel fuel purchases through december interest rates 
our floating rate exposure relates to changes in the six month london interbank offered rate libor and the overnight federal funds rate 
assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held as of fiscal year end  a basis point change in each of these rates would have an impact of approximately million on our annual interest expense 
in the third quarter of and the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate 
in  we had short term investments throughout a majority of the year  principally invested in money market funds and commercial paper  which were most closely tied to the overnight federal funds rate 
the amount of these investments was not significant throughout the year 
assuming a basis point change in the rate of interest associated with our short term investments  interest income would not have changed by a significant amount 
currency exchange rates 
because we operate in non us franchise territories  we are subject to exposure resulting from changes in currency exchange rates 
currency exchange rates are influenced by a variety of economic factors including local inflation  growth  interest rates and governmental actions  as well as other factors 
we currently do not hedge the translation risks of investments in our non us operations 
any positive cash flows generated have been reinvested in the operations  excluding repayments of intercompany loans from the manufacturing operations in poland 
based on net sales  non us operations represented approximately percent of our total operations in changes in currency exchange rates impact the translation of the non us operations results from their local currencies into us dollars 
if the currency exchange rates had changed by ten percent in  we estimate the impact on reported operating income would have been approximately million 
our estimate reflects the fact that a portion of the non us operations costs are denominated in non us dollars  including concentrate purchases 
this estimate does not take into account the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains in one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category 
equity prices 
we were subject to equity price risk due to the repurchase of our common stock through our accelerated stock repurchase program see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
at the end of the program  we were required to receive or pay a price adjustment based on the difference between the weighted average price of our stock over the life of the program and the initial purchase price of per share 
at our election  any payments we were obligated to make pursuant to the settlement of the forward contract could either be in cash or in shares of our common stock 
changes in the fair value of our common stock impacted the final settlement of the program 
at the end of  the investment bank had acquired million shares at an average price of per share  which included our payment of a price adjustment of million 
we paid the price adjustment in cash 
as this program was settled in the fourth quarter of  we were not subject to equity price risk associated with this transaction as of fiscal year end
