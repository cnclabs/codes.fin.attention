item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview to facilitate your review and understanding of this section of our report and the financial statements that follow  we are providing this overview of what management believes are the most important considerations for understanding our company and its business the key factors that drive our business and the principal associated risks 
the company we are a public equity reit that invests in senior housing and long term care properties 
passive investments our investments are passive ie  we do not operate the properties  investor flexibility liquidity investors desiring to invest in this real estate sector can do so with an investment flexibility and liquidity that is not available in most direct investments  and no double taxation our income is not taxed at the corporate level as long as we continue to distribute to our stockholders at least of our taxable income and meet other reit tax requirements 
business purpose our long term corporate goal is clearly defined to provide stockholders with an attractive total return based on a secure dividend 
our business model for achieving this goal is based on a foundation of proactive capital and portfolio management and quality ffo growth  and is equally straightforward 
we invest passively in geographically diversified senior housing and long term care properties primarily assisted and independent living facilities and skilled nursing facilities  drawing on our extensive management expertise and operational experience in this real estate sector 
our focus remains on this sector because we continue to believe in its growth potential  as evidenced by the favorable demographics of a rapidly growing elderly population and the corresponding recognized need for additional and improved senior housing and long term care alternatives 
operations we primarily make our investments by acquiring an ownership interest in facilities and leasing them to unaffiliated operators under triple net master leases that pass all facility operating costs insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance  capital improvements  etc 
through to the tenant operator 
in addition  but intentionally to a much lesser extent because we view the risks of this activity to be greater  from time to time we extend mortgage loans and other financing to operators 
currently  about of our revenues are derived from our leases  with the remaining from our mortgage loans and other financing 
last three years in  we continued the de leveraging program started in early which included a dividend reduction of about with a goal of creating a more conservative capital structure  providing greater financial flexibility to reliably finance growth and establishing a more secure base for our dividend 
we accomplished this primarily by raising approximately  in net new equity  expanding our credit line by  to  and lowering our dividend payout ratio from in to in and in the fourth quarter 
as a result  we believe we have enhanced our credit statistics and balance sheet  helped preserve and strengthen our investment grade credit ratings which moody s investors service  standard poor s ratings services and fitch ratings affirmed in and positioned ourselves for further growth from a conservative base 
our diluted funds from operations increased in over by over 
this increase in ffo primarily relates to a record year of  in new investments and the completion of a  independent and assisted living facility  greater internal growth and reduced interest expense as a result of our 
table of contents de leveraging program and a low interest rate environment 
we define funds from operations or ffo  the key measurement tool that most reit managements looks to in running their businesses  as net income excluding extraordinary items  less preferred stock dividends  plus depreciation and amortization  less gains losses on sales of facilities 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our funds from operations may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other reits or as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states funds from operations does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and  therefore  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
below we have listed some of the factors that have adversely impacted our ffo in the recent past and may again in the future 
to help better anticipate and mitigate potential problems in the future  in we established a formal portfolio management program and hired a senior vice president and chief portfolio officer that reports directly to our chief executive officer 
portfolio management now joins capital management and quality ffo growth at center stage as the three drivers of our business 
operator financial problems in early s 
as has demonstrated  largely marked the end of what had been a very challenging period for many of our operators as they worked through  with varying degrees of success  financial problems largely caused by skilled nursing facility and assisted and independent living facility capital market excesses in the late s and government reimbursement issues 
overly enamored with the sector s long term favorable demographics  a wide range of debt and equity investors flooded this market with large sums of readily available capital that led to excessive levels of operator debt and overbuilding primarily in assisted and independent living in the late s 
this in turn led to a large number of bankruptcies including five of the seven largest publicly traded skilled nursing facility operators and several assisted and independent living operators  including our largest tenant  alterra healthcare corporation and restructurings in the early s 
our net income and ffo were adversely affected as a result of lost revenues from i negotiated rent reductions in restructured leases  ii rent reductions or rent deferrals on facilities taken back from tenants through lease terminations in and out of bankruptcy that were leased to new operators and iii facility closures 
our net income and ffo were also adversely impacted by bankruptcy related expenses and other costs  including substantially increased general and administrative expenses 
for the first time in many years  we ended with no operators in bankruptcy 
capital redeployment from mortgage loan payoffs and purchase option exercises 
we experienced an increase in mortgage loan payoffs and purchase option exercises 
the mortgage payoffs largely resulted from a program we initiated to make our asset base more secure by increasing the relative mix of leased versus mortgaged properties 
unlike leases  in bankruptcy a debtor does not need to determine timely whether to assign  affirm or reject the mortgage in its entirety nor is it required to make mortgage payments until it makes that determination  but rather can ignore its obligations  challenge the economics of the mortgage and cram down terms including principal amount  interest rate and payment terms to those reflecting typically distressed market levels 
to lower our overall exposure to this scenario  we encouraged prepayments by waiving any prepayment fees 
while our goal of improving our risk profile was met  our net income and ffo were adversely affected by the mortgage loan payoffs and purchase option exercises because we were unable to replace the significant lost revenues from the higher yielding leases and loans 
rather  because there were not any desirable new investments available to us at that time in fact  desirable new investments first became available in  we instead were forced to re deploy the capital to fulfill existing construction commitments for new assisted and independent living facilities that were not yet yielding revenue and otherwise pay down our lower cost debt 
restricted growth in early s 
because of the factors noted above  we had no net internal growth in revenues from our existing portfolio and saw our net income and ffo decrease until similarly  with the exception of  we had only modest external growth in revenues from acquisitions until 
table of contents in  a number of attractive investment opportunities became available largely as a result of industry wide restructurings 
to supplement our capital sources and take advantage of these opportunities  we formed a joint venture with an institutional investor 
by the end of  we had made a total of about  in new investments   for our own account and  by our joint venture  which has contributed to our net income and ffo growth 
focus and outlook for our focus for is to increase our net income and ffo on an absolute and per share basis 
in that regard  we remain cautiously optimistic about both our internal and external growth prospects for we believe that the worst of the restructurings is behind us and  accordingly  like  the annual rent increases built into our leases should overcome any reasonably foreseeable further restructurings 
we expect same store internal growth to increase for largely as a result of investments in and rent escalators in our leases 
this is likely to be offset this year  however  from lost revenues from loan payoffs in and potentially significant lost rent from likely purchase option exercises in while the market is extremely competitive at this point  we also are seeing a fair number of potentially attractive investment opportunities that we will carefully evaluate 
in management s view  there are four principal near term challenges we face in achieving our business objectives 
the first is the continued availability of competitively priced capital 
this in turn is largely dependent on external factors such as interest rates and equity market volatility 
if these factors end up being more adverse than we expect for  it could adversely impact our ability to grow 
the second is increasing interest in our sector from new reits and other larger capital providers  which in turn is increasing competition and reducing spreads or limiting attractive investment opportunities 
the third principal challenge is consolidation at either or both of the reit or operator levels which is likely to result in better capitalized competitors and fewer customers 
finally  there may end up being more serious operator financial problems that lead to more extensive restructurings or tenant disruptions than we currently expect 
this could be unique to a particular operator or it could be more industry wide  such as further federal or state governmental reimbursement reductions in the case of our skilled nursing facilities as governments work through their budget deficits  continuing reduced occupancies or slow lease ups for our assisted and independent living facilities due to general economic and other factors  continuing increases in liability  insurance premiums and other expenses 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact our most critical accounting policies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our rental revenue is accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for leases sfas no 
and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
among other authoritative pronouncements 
these pronouncements require us to account for the rental income on a straight line basis unless a more appropriate method exists 
we believe that the method most reflective of the use of a healthcare facility with fixed rate increases is the straight line method 
straight line accounting requires us to calculate the total fixed rent to be paid over the life of the lease and recognize that revenue evenly over that life 
in a situation where a lease calls 
table of contents for fixed rental increases during the life of a lease or there is a period of free rent at the beginning of a lease  rental income recorded in the early years of a lease is higher than the actual cash rent received which creates an asset on the balance sheet called deferred rent receivable 
at some point during the lease  depending on the rent levels and terms  this reverses and the cash rent payments received during the later years of the lease are higher than the rental income recognized  which reduces the deferred rent receivable balance to zero by the end of the lease 
the majority of our leases do not contain fixed increases or provide for free or reduced rent at the beginning of the lease term 
however  certain leases for facilities we have constructed have had free rent for the first three to six months and certain leases we entered into  primarily with regard to facilities returned to us by operators in bankruptcy have had reduced or free rent in the early months of the lease or fixed increases in future years 
we record the rent for these facilities on a straight line basis in accordance with sfas no 
however  we also assess the collectibility of the deferred portion of the rent that is to be collected in a future period in accordance with sab no 
this assessment is based on several factors  including the financial strength of the lessee and any guarantors  the historical operations and operating trends of the facility  the historical payment pattern of the facility and whether we intend to continue to lease the facility to the current operator  among others 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not receive the rent payments due in the future  we provide a reserve against the current rental income as an offset to revenue  and depending on the circumstances  we may provide a reserve against the existing deferred rent balance for the portion  up to its full value  that we estimate will not be recovered 
this assessment requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating the future rent payments may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the rent that will not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding a lease change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the rental revenue recognized and or deferred rent receivable balance 
we recognized  of cash received in excess of revenues during   of revenues in excess of cash received during and  of revenues in excess of cash received during there is  at december   and  at december   of deferred rent receivables  net of reserves  recorded under the caption other assets on the balance sheets 
the ultimate amount of deferred rent we realize could be less than amounts currently recorded 
additional rents are generally computed as a percentage of facility revenues in excess of base amounts or as a percentage of the increase in the consumer price index 
we do not straight line rent contingent on revenue increases or increases in the consumer price index 
additional rents are generally calculated and payable monthly or quarterly  and most of our leases contain provisions such that total rent cannot decrease from one year to the next 
while the calculations and payments of additional rents contingent upon revenue are generally made on a quarterly basis  sab no 
does not allow for the recognition of this revenue until all possible contingencies have been eliminated 
most of our leases with additional rents contingent upon revenue are structured as quarterly calculations so that all contingencies for revenue recognition have been eliminated at each of our quarterly reporting dates 
depreciation and useful lives of assets we calculate depreciation on our buildings and improvements using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging up to years  generally from to years 
a significant portion of the cost of each property is allocated to building generally approximately 
the allocation of the cost between land and building  and the determination of the useful life of a property  are based on management s estimates 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on equipment and lease costs using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of up to five years or the lease term  whichever is appropriate 
we review and adjust useful lives periodically 
if we do not allocate appropriately between land and building or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our assets  our computation of depreciation and amortization will not appropriately reflect the usage of the assets over future periods 
if we overestimate the useful life of an asset  the depreciation expense related to the asset will be understated  which could result in a loss if the asset is sold in the future 
asset impairment we review our long lived assets individually on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
table of contents sfas no 

indicators may include  among others  the tenant s inability to make rent payments  operating losses or negative operating trends at the facility level  notification by the tenant that it will not renew its lease  a decision to dispose of an asset or changes in the market value of the property 
for operating assets  if indicators of impairment exist  we compare the undiscounted cash flows from the expected use of the property to its net book value to determine if impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is higher than the current net book value  in accordance with sfas no 
 we conclude no impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is lower than the current net book value  we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair market value 
to the extent we decide to sell an asset  we recognize an impairment loss if the current net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value less costs to sell 
the above analyses require us to determine whether there are indicators of impairment for individual assets  to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows from operating assets and to determine the fair value of assets that are impaired or held for sale 
if our assumptions  projections or estimates regarding an asset change in the future  we may have to record an impairment charge to reduce or further reduce the net book value of such asset 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment of assets charge of  in discontinued operations related to one of our assets held for sale 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment of assets charge of  in discontinued operations related to three of our assets held for sale 
collectibility of receivables we evaluate the collectibility of our mortgage loans and other receivables on a regular basis 
we evaluate the collectibility of receivables based on factors including  among others  payment history  the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors  the value of the underlying collateral  the operations and operating trends of the underlying collateral  if any  and current economic conditions 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not recover the full value of the receivable  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate will not be recovered 
this analysis requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating a receivable may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the receivable that will not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of a receivable change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the carrying value of the receivable 
during  we reserved  of delinquent rent and interest receivable from one tenant 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb released interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
in april  the fasb released sfas no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in may  the fasb released sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
in december  the fasb released sfas no 
revised share based payment 
we adopted the original sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation in and have recognized all stock based compensation in our income statement since that time 
the effect of these pronouncements on our financial statements is not expected to be material 
operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  rental income increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to rental income from facilities acquired and one facility that was completed during and rent increases at existing facilities 
the increase was partially offset by rent reductions on certain facilities that were returned to us during and reserves against certain receivables that may not be collectible 
interest and other income decreased  or in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the early payoff of eight mortgage loans  the payoff at maturity of two mortgage loans  and partial repayments of four others during interest and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payoff of  of fixed rate medium term notes in  the 
table of contents payoff of  of fixed rate medium term notes during and a decrease in the weighted average balance on our unsecured credit facility versus last year 
the decrease was almost entirely offset by interest related to  of assumed mortgage debt secured by eight facilities acquired during and interest on a  mortgage secured by one existing building financed during third quarter depreciation and amortization increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily related to depreciation on the facilities acquired and one facility that completed development during general and administrative expenses increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to a one time charge of  for retirement compensation related to our retiring chief executive officer   of expense related to the lease up of a restructured skilled nursing facility  the addition of a chief portfolio officer position  an increase in legal fees  sarbanes oxley related expenses and increases in other general corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses in to be relatively consistent with income from unconsolidated joint venture represents our share of the income generated by the joint venture and our management fee of of the revenues of the unconsolidated joint venture 
please see the caption investment in unconsolidated joint venture below for more information regarding the unconsolidated joint venture 
discontinued operations reflects income of  in versus a loss of  in discontinued operations consists of gain loss on sale of facilities and income loss from discontinued operations 
the gain on sale of facilities in of  resulted from the sale of two skilled nursing facilities  two assets held for sale and one land parcel for total cash proceeds of  and the recognition of  of deferred gain upon the payoff of three mortgage loans 
the loss on sale of facilities in of  resulted from the sale of ten facilities  four buildings held for sale and four land parcels held for sale 
the loss in discontinued operations of  is a reduction of  from the income of  for the same period in the loss for is comprised of revenues of  less depreciation on the facilities sold in of  general and administrative expenses related to assets held for sale of  and an impairment of  related to one asset held for sale 
the income for is comprised of  of rental income offset by  of depreciation and amortization   of general and administrative expenses and an impairment of assets charge of  related to three assets held for sale 
the difference in the composition of the loss from discontinued operations was primarily caused by the fact that the facilities sold in had income in  but do not have income in  the facilities sold in had income in but had income for only a portion of and the assets held for sale generate expenses  but generally do not produce income 
any future income loss in discontinued operations would result from future sales of facilities or reclassifications of facilities to assets held for sale 
we expect to receive increased rent and interest at individual facilities because our leases and mortgages generally contain provisions under which rents or interest income increase with increases in facility revenues and or increases in the consumer price index 
if revenues at our facilities and or the consumer price index do not increase  our revenues may not continue to increase 
sales of facilities or repayments of mortgage loans receivable would serve to offset revenue increases  and if sales and repayments exceed additional investments this could actually reduce revenues 
our leases could renew below or above the aggregate existing rent level  so the impact of lease renewals may cause a decrease or an increase in the total rent we receive 
we currently have only three leases covering six facilities expiring in several of our tenants have purchase options that may be exercised in  and we believe a number of these will be exercised 
the exercise of purchase options by tenants would also cause a decrease in the total rent we receive 
we currently have no scheduled mortgage loan maturities in additional investments in healthcare facilities would increase rental and or interest income 
as additional investments in facilities are made  depreciation and or interest expense will also increase 
we expect any such increases to be at least partially offset by rent or interest income associated with the investments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  rental income increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to rental income from three facilities acquired during and facilities acquired during  rental income 
table of contents from five facilities we acquired during that previously had an aggregate mortgage loans receivable balance of  and rent increases at existing facilities 
the increase was partially offset by rent reductions on certain facilities that were returned to us and leased to other operators in and interest and other income decreased by  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payoff at par of mortgage loans receivable totaling  securing six facilities  acquiring title to five facilities previously having an aggregate mortgage loans receivable balance of  during and regular principal repayments of notes receivable during and the decrease was partially offset by interest earned on a new mortgage loan with a balance of  in and a new mortgage loan with a balance of  in interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the issuance of  of fixed rate medium term notes in third quarter  the assumption of a  mortgage note on one facility acquired during second quarter and obtaining a  mortgage secured by one existing facility in third quarter the increase was partially offset by the payoff of  of fixed rate medium term notes during  the payoff of  of fixed rate medium term notes during  a reduction in the average balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility during and a reduction in the average interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
depreciation and amortization increased  or  in as compared to the increase was due primarily to depreciation on the facilities acquired during  the acquisition of three facilities during and acquiring title to five facilities previously having an aggregate mortgage loans receivable balance of  during general and administrative expenses increased  or  in as compared to primarily due to expenses related to facilities returned to us and leased to other operators in  increases in legal fees related to operators in bankruptcy  the addition of a chief operating officer position and increase in other general corporate expenses 
income from unconsolidated joint venture represents our share of the income generated by the joint venture and our management fee of of the revenues of the unconsolidated joint venture 
the increase of  or  in as compared to is due to the joint venture owned facilities generating revenue for all of  versus facilities producing revenue from april to september and facilities producing revenue from october to december please see the caption investment in unconsolidated joint venture below for more information regarding the unconsolidated joint venture 
discontinued operations reflects a loss of  in versus a loss of  in discontinued operations consists of gain loss on sale of facilities and income loss from discontinued operations 
the loss on sale of facilities of  in is due to the sale of ten facilities  four buildings held for sale and four land parcels held for sale 
the gain on sale of facilities of  in is due to the sale of six facilities  five buildings held for sale and one land parcel held for sale 
the income from discontinued operations in reflects the revenues less the depreciation and amortization and other expenses related to the facilities sold and those classified as held for sale during offset by an impairment of assets charge of  related to three assets held for sale 
the loss from discontinued operations in reflects an impairment of assets charge of  related to assets held for sale partially offset by the revenues less the depreciation and amortization and other expenses related to the facilities sold and those classified as held for sale during and the income from discontinued operations in of  is significantly higher than the loss from discontinued operations in of  primarily due to the impairment of assets charge of  in versus an impairment of assets charge of only  in  the facilities disposed of in being included in income from discontinued operations for only the portion of prior to their sale while they were included for all of and the facilities disposed of in being included in income from discontinued operations for the portion of prior to their sale 
information regarding certain operators as of december   none of our tenant operators remained in chapter reorganization bankruptcy proceedings 

table of contents investment in unconsolidated joint venture during  we entered into a joint venture with jer senior housing  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of jer partners  an institutional investor 
the joint venture was established to invest up to  of which over  was invested  in healthcare facilities similar to those already owned by us 
we hold a equity interest in the venture 
the financial statements of the joint venture are not consolidated with our financial statements and our investment is accounted for using the equity method 
no investments were made by or into this joint venture prior to during  the joint venture sold two facilities for cash proceeds of  resulting in a loss of  which is included in discontinued operations 
the joint venture owns assisted living facilities in states that are leased to alterra 
the joint venture was financed with secured non recourse debt of approximately  capital contributions from our co joint venturer of approximately  and capital contributions from us of approximately  we do not expect to make any additional contributions to the joint venture related to the facilities it acquired during the joint venture sold one facility during  however the impact of the sale is not material to us 
the joint venture agreement contains reciprocal buy sell provisions that allow either of us at any time to offer to buy out the other s interest in the venture 
if such an offer is made  the recipient then has the choice to either accept the offer and sell its interest on those terms or reject the offer and buy the offeror s interest on the same economic terms 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash provided by operating activities for increased  over this was primarily due to increased revenues of  discussed above  partially offset by increases in interest expense and general and administrative expenses 
there have been no significant changes in the underlying sources and uses of cash provided by operating activities 
investing activities during  we acquired skilled nursing facilities  assisted and independent living facilities and five specialty hospitals in separate transactions for an aggregate investment of  including the assumption of  of mortgage financing 
we also completed the development of a  independent and assisted living facility  of which  was funded in  and funded  in expansions  construction and capital improvements at certain facilities in accordance with existing lease provisions 
such expansions  construction and capital improvements generally result in an increase in the minimum rents earned by us on these facilities either at the time of funding or upon completion of the project 
at december   we have committed to fund additional expansions  construction and capital improvements of approximately  on february   we acquired skilled nursing facilities in one transaction with a purchase price of  during  we sold two skilled nursing facilities to the operators of the facilities pursuant to purchase options  two assets held for sale and one land parcel for cash proceeds of  these sales resulted in a gain of  that is included in gain on sale of facilities in discontinued operations 
we also sold the skilled nursing portion of a continuing care retirement community  at net book value  for which we provided a mortgage loan to the buyer of  in addition  gain on sale for includes  of deferred gain related to the payoff of three purchase financing mortgage loans 

table of contents during  eight mortgage loans receivable were prepaid in full and two were repaid at maturity with principal balances totaling  and partial principal prepayments of  were received related to other mortgage loans 
the payoff of three of these mortgage loans receivable resulted in a gain of  that is included in gain on sale of facilities in discontinued operations 
financing activities during  we repaid  of fixed rate medium term notes that bore interest at a weighted average rate of 
the repayments were funded by borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by cash on hand 
we anticipate repaying maturing medium term notes with a combination of proceeds from borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and cash on hand 
borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility would be repaid by potential asset sales and mortgage loans receivable payoffs  the potential issuance of debt or equity securities under the shelf registration statements discussed below or cash from operations 
our medium term notes have been investment grade rated since our current ratings are baa from moody s investors service  bbb from standard poor s ratings services and bbb from fitch ratings 
on april   our new  unsecured revolving credit facility became effective and replaced our previous  credit facility 
at december   we had  available under our  unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on april   which we may extend for an additional year 
the new credit facility  including the required financial covenants  is substantially the same as the prior credit facility with the only significant changes being the total amount available for borrowing  the new maturity date of april   an increase in the maximum secured debt ratio from to and a reduction in our libor borrowing spread from basis points to basis points 
in november  we obtained an amendment to the credit facility that excludes borrowings under the credit facility from the floating rate debt covenant 
under covenants contained in the credit agreement  we are required to maintain  among other things i a minimum net asset value of  ii a ratio of total indebtedness to capitalization value of not more than  iii an interest coverage ratio of at least to  iv a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to  v a secured indebtedness ratio of not more than  vi an unsecured interest coverage ratio of at least to  vii floating rate debt  excluding credit facility borrowings  of no more than of total debt  viii an unencumbered asset value ratio of no more than  and ix a minimum rent mortgage interest coverage ratio of at least to as of december   we were in compliance with all of the above covenants 
we believe we have sufficient margin in the various debt covenants that we expect to remain in compliance throughout in january  we issued  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of per share 
this issuance resulted in net proceeds of approximately  after underwriting discounts and legal and other fees of approximately  the net proceeds were used to repay all of the then outstanding borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility of  and the remaining proceeds of approximately  were initially invested as cash and cash equivalents and ultimately used to fund acquisitions subsequent to the public offering and for other general corporate purposes 
in july  we issued  shares of series b cumulative convertible preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share 
the combined issuances resulted in net proceeds of approximately  after underwriting discounts and other fees of approximately  the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
each share of series b preferred stock is convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder at an initial conversion price of per share upon the occurrence of certain events  including our stock reaching a price of per share 
we may redeem the series b preferred stock after july  at the redemption price of per share  reducing each year by  until reaching par  or in july 
table of contents during  we adopted a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
this plan enables existing stockholders to purchase additional shares of common stock by automatically reinvesting all or part of the cash dividends paid on their shares of common stock 
the plan also allows investors to acquire shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations  including a maximum monthly investment of  at a discount ranging from to  determined by us from time to time in accordance with the plan 
the discount during and at december  was 
during the year ended december   we issued approximately  shares of common stock  at an average price of  resulting in net proceeds of approximately  that were used to repay borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
at december   we had shelf registration statements on file with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue a up to  in aggregate principal amount of medium term notes and b up to approximately  of securities including debt  convertible debt  common and preferred stock 
in addition  at december   we had approximately  shares available for issuance under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
we did not utilize any off balance sheet financing arrangements nor have any unconsolidated subsidiaries prior to second quarter the only off balance sheet financing arrangement that we currently utilize is the unconsolidated joint venture discussed above under the caption investment in unconsolidated joint venture 
financing for future investments and for the repayment of the obligations and commitments noted above may be provided by borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility discussed above  private placements or public offerings of debt or equity either under the shelf registration statements discussed above or under new registration statements  the assumption of secured indebtedness  obtaining mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures 
we believe the combination of the available balance on the unsecured revolving credit facility and the availability under the shelf registration statements is sufficient to meet our expected cash requirements for we anticipate the possible sale of certain facilities  primarily due to purchase option exercises  and the potential repayment of certain mortgage loans receivable during in the event that there are facility sales or mortgage loan receivable repayments in excess of new investments  revenues may decrease 
we anticipate using the proceeds from any facility sales or mortgage loans receivable repayments to provide capital for future investments  to reduce the outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility or to repay other borrowings as they mature 
any such reduction in debt levels would result in reduced interest expense that we believe would partially offset any decrease in revenues 
we believe the combination of the available balance on our new  unsecured revolving credit facility and the availability under the shelf registration statements provides sufficient liquidity and financing capability to finance anticipated future investments  maintain our current dividend level and repay borrowings at or prior to their maturity  for at least the next months 
contractual obligations and cash requirements as of december   our contractual obligations are as follows thereafter total in thousands contractual obligations long term debt operating leases commitments capital expenditures 
table of contents the long term debt amount shown maturing in includes the current balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility of  that expires on april  we have the ability to unilaterally extend the facility for one additional year 
prior to  or upon expiration  we expect to replace the facility rather than repay the outstanding balance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our mortgage loans receivable and debt 
we do not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analyses is to provide a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in these paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 

table of contents we provide mortgage loans to operators of healthcare facilities as part of our normal operations 
the majority of the loans have fixed rates 
three of our mortgage loans have adjustable rates  however  the rates adjust only once or twice over the term of the loans and the minimum adjusted rates are equal to the then current rates 
therefore  all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
we utilize debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in healthcare facilities 
historically  we have made short term borrowings on our variable rate unsecured revolving credit facility to fund our acquisitions until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
a portion of our secured debt is variable rate debt in the form of housing revenue bonds that were assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain healthcare facilities 
pursuant to the associated lease arrangements  increases or decreases in the interest rates on the housing revenue bonds would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the rent received by us on the properties securing this debt 
therefore  there is substantially no market risk associated with this variable rate secured debt 
during the twelve months ended december   the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility have increased from  to for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt other than the housing revenue bonds described above  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
we generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  and including the bank borrowings as variable rate debt due to its nature  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  the table below details the principal amounts and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates 
certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity 
maturity date thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable  net average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate unsecured revolving credit facility average interest rate

any future interest rate increases will further increase the cost of borrowings on our bank line of credit and any borrowings to refinance long term debt as it matures or to finance future acquisitions
