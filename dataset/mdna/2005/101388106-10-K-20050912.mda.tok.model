table of contents the non gaap presentation above consists of a reconciliation of our net income or loss before the cumulative effect of accounting changes and income taxes to a measure of non gaap net income or loss 
we present this supplemental information  in the form of non gaap financial measures  which excludes certain non cash items specifically in process research and development charges  amortization of intangible assets and stock compensation expense 
we believe that this supplemental  non gaap presentation is useful to investors because it allows for an evaluation of bottomline with a focus on the performance of its core operations 
our executive management team  including our chief operating decision makers  use this same non gaap measure internally to assess the on going performance of bottomline 
since the presentation above is not a gaap measurement of financial performance  there are material limitations to its usefulness on a stand alone basis  including the lack of comparability of this presentation to the gaap financial results of other companies 
accordingly the non gaap information should not be used in isolation to  or as a substitute for  our gaap results 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to comply with recent accounting pronouncements and for comparative purposes 
to ensure comparability  these reclassifications also reflect changes in where certain classes of employees are now reported within our operating expense categories

this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the statements contained in this annual report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of without limiting the foregoing  the words may  will  should  could  expects  plans  intends  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential  continue and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements included in this annual report on form k are based on information available to us up to  and including the date of this document  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and certain factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this form k 
you should carefully review those factors and also carefully review the risks outlined in other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we provide software products and services for business payments and invoice management 
our solutions enable organizations to automate  manage  standardize and control transaction based processes across the enterprise  particularly those that involve making payments  sending and receiving invoices  receiving payments  
table of contents generating business documents and conducting electronic banking 
we offer software designed to run on site at the customer s location as well as hosted solutions 
our products are sold on either a perpetual license or subscription basis 
in fiscal year  we improved our operating results through continued revenue growth and management of expenses 
our revenue increased from million to million 
this revenue increase was attributable to an increase in our uk business as a result of the bacstel ip initiative in the uk  a full year s revenue contribution from createform during the year  an increase in foreign exchange rates and two months revenue contribution as a result of our acquisition of hmsl in april we derived approximately of our revenue from international subsidiaries 
we expect revenue to grow during fiscal year as a result of market opportunities such as purchases by both new and existing banking and financial institution customers in north america  the continued market adoption of our legal exchange product in the us  revenue contribution from hmsl  and the contribution of revenue from new products 
our net income of million in is a significant improvement over our net loss of million in this improvement was principally due to our revenue growth and our ability to manage expenses  decreases in amortization expense of intangible assets and the absence of charges associated with in process research and development 
our fiscal year results include approximately million of acquisition related charges in the form of amortization of intangible assets million and stock compensation expense 
revenue sources our revenues are derived from multiple sources  and are reported under the following classifications software license fees 
software license revenues  which we derive from our software applications  are generally based on the number of software applications and user licenses purchased 
fees from the sale of software licenses are generally recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer 
however  certain of our software arrangements  primarily those sold within our tailored solutions segment  are often recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project because they require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods 
service and maintenance fees 
our service and maintenance revenues consist of subscription and transaction fees  professional services fees and customer support and maintenance fees 
transaction revenues relating to our legal exchange product and our other transactional based product offerings are typically recognized at the time transactions are processed 
subscription revenues are recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period 
revenues relating to professional services not associated with customized software solutions are normally recognized at the time services are rendered 
professional services revenues associated with software license arrangements that include significant customization and modification are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project 
software maintenance fees  which are established as a percentage  typically  of the list price for the software license  are recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance period 
certain of our offerings  particularly our outsourced and transactional service offerings  often require customers to pay a non refundable set up or installation fee 
in such cases  since the up front payment does not reflect a separate earnings process by bottomline  these fees are deferred and are recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the customer relationship  which is generally four years 
equipment and supplies revenues 
we derive equipment and supplies revenues from the sale of printers  check paper and magnetic ink character recognition toners 
these revenues are normally recognized at the time of delivery 
equipment and supplies revenue also includes postage and shipping related charges billed to customers 
reclassifications certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance 
we refer to such policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate  and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used 
these critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition and goodwill and intangible assets 
these critical policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are discussed below 
in addition  refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from the sale of both perpetual and subscription based software licenses  transactional based outsourced offerings  professional services  software maintenance and equipment and supplies 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
we consider a non cancelable fully executed agreement or customer purchase order to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to have occurred upon transfer of product title to the customer  or completion of services rendered 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to adjustment  or if we have not granted extended payment terms to the customer 
excluding our long term contract arrangements for which revenue is recorded on a percentage of completion basis  our normal payment terms do not exceed days 
we consider collection to be probable if our internal credit analysis indicates that the customer will be able to pay amounts as they become due under the arrangement 
our sales arrangements can contain multiple revenue elements  such as perpetual or subscription based software licenses  transaction fees  professional services  and software maintenance 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate element treatment is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
revenue allocated to the software element is based on the residual method  under which revenue equal to the fair value of professional services and software support is allocated to those items and recognized as revenue as those items are delivered 
any residual or remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is then allocated to the software license 
revenue is recognized for each element when each of the aforementioned revenue recognition criteria has been met 
certain of our software development arrangements require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods 
these arrangements do not qualify for separate element revenue recognition treatment  as described above  and instead must be accounted for under contract accounting 
under contract accounting  companies must select from two generally accepted methods of accounting the completed contract method and the percentage of completion method 
the completed contract method recognizes revenue only upon contract completion  and all project costs and revenues are reported as deferred items in the balance sheet until that time 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue and costs on a contract as the work progresses 
we have historically used the percentage of completion method of accounting for our long term and custom contracts  since we believe that we can make reasonably reliable estimates of progress toward completion 
progress is measured based on labor hours  as measured at the end of each reporting period  as a percentage of total expected labor hours 
accordingly  the revenue we record in any reporting period for arrangements accounted for on a percentage of completion basis is dependent upon our estimates of the remaining labor hours that will be incurred in fulfilling our contractual obligations 
our estimates at the end of any reporting period could prove to be materially different from final project results  as determined only at subsequent stages of project completion 
to mitigate this risk  we solicit the input of our project professional staff on a monthly basis  as well as at the end of each reporting period  for purposes of evaluating cumulative labor hours incurred and the estimated remaining effort to completion  so that our estimates are always based on the most current projections available 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets effective july   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas relating to goodwill and intangible assets 
we were required to perform a transitional impairment test upon adoption to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
based on the results of this impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million associated with goodwill in bottomline europe 
this amount was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations 
we were required to calculate the fair value of our reporting units in connection with the impairment review 
the principal component of each fair value calculation was the determination of discounted future cash flows  and there were a number of variables that we considered for purposes of projecting these future cash flows 
there is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process  and  while our estimates were consistent with our internal planning assumptions  the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time 
the particularly sensitive components of these estimates included  but were not limited to the selection of an appropriate discount rate  the required return on all assets employed by the valued asset to generate future income streams  our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue  our gross margin estimates which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue  the level of bottomline us products that will be sold by bottomline europe  our software product life cycles  the attrition rate of our customers  particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams such as software maintenance  our planned level of operating expenses  and our effective tax rate 
the use of different assumptions or projections  in some or all of the areas noted above  would likely have resulted in different fair value results  thus affecting our determination of the overall goodwill impairment 
since the adoption of sfas  we test our goodwill at least annually for impairment and for we performed this review during our fourth quarter which is the historic timing of our annual goodwill impairment review 
based on this review  we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment 
our analysis was performed at the reporting unit level 
our analysis of goodwill impairment required an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit  which is an inherently subjective process 
based on the results of our impairment review we concluded that  by a wide margin  none of our reporting units was impaired 
there can be no assurance that there will not be impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of our future periodic impairment reviews 
to the extent that future impairment charges occurred  it would likely have a material impact on our financial results 
at june   the carrying value of goodwill for all of our reporting units was approximately million 
in addition to our annual goodwill review  we also perform periodic reviews of the carrying value of our other intangible assets 
these intangible assets consist of acquired core technology and customer related intangibles such as acquired customer lists and customer contracts 
we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present  including whether there has been a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  whether there has been a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  and whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life 

table of contents if indicators of impairment are present  an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate must be made  to ensure that the carrying value of the asset can be recovered 
these estimates involve significant subjectivity 
at june   the carrying value of our intangible assets  excluding goodwill  was million 
none of these assets were deemed to be impaired 
valuation of acquired intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of createform in september and our acquisition of albion business machines ltd 
abm in may we recorded in process research and development charges of  and  respectively 
for each of these acquisitions  and for the acquisition of hmsl in april  we also recorded several other intangible assets relating to acquired core technology and customer related intangible assets 
the valuation process used to calculate the values assigned to the in process research and development and the acquired intangible assets is complex and involves significant estimation relative to our financial projections 
the principal component of the valuation is the determination of discounted future cash flows  and there are a number of variables that we considered for purposes of projecting these future cash flows 
there is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process  and  while our estimates are consistent with our internal planning assumptions  the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time 
further  the projections required for the valuation process normally utilize a ten year forecast  which exceeds our normal internal planning and forecasting timeline 
the particularly sensitive components of these estimates include  but are not limited to the selection of an appropriate discount rate  the required return on all assets employed by the valued asset to generate future income streams  our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue  our gross margin estimates which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue  our technology and product life cycles  the attrition rate of our customers  particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams such as software maintenance  our planned level of operating expenses  and our effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the guidance of eitf is applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  fiscal for us and companies are permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the adoption of eitf on july  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas provides for alternative methods of voluntary transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and it requires more prominent disclosures  in both interim and annual financial statements  about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported financial results 
sfas is effective for interim periods beginning after december   and for annual periods ending after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  since we elected to continue to account for our stock based compensation 
table of contents using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb however  we have modified the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements as required by the pronouncement 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose was to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the issuance of sab reflects the concepts contained in eitf  the other revenue recognition concepts outlined in sab remain largely unchanged 
the adoption of sab during fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under sfas r  companies will be required to recognize as expense the estimated fair value of all share based payments to employees  including the fair value of employee stock options 
pro forma disclosure of the estimated expense impact of such awards is no longer an alternative to expense recognition within the financial statements 
sfas r is effective for public companies in the first annual reporting period beginning after june  accordingly  we will adopt the provisions of sfas r effective july   the first quarter of our fiscal year 
there are two transition alternatives for public companies adopting the statement the modified prospective method and the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  companies are required to recognize compensation cost for share based payments to employees  based on the grant date estimate of fair value  from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions of sfas r are first applied 
prior period financial information would not be restated under this method 
under the modified retrospective method  companies would restate prior periods to include the recognition of compensation cost based on amounts previously reported in the pro forma disclosures relating to stock based compensation under the existing requirements of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  such as is presented in note to our audited financial statements 
we expect to elect the modified prospective method  upon adoption 
we expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material effect on our financial statements  in the form of additional compensation expense  on a quarterly and annual basis 
we are still in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas r  and have not yet quantified the expense impact of this accounting pronouncement on future financial periods 
however  our historic financial statements  as well as our financial results for the year ended june   are relevant data points for gauging the potential level of expense that might be recorded in future periods 
based on these results  we estimate that quarterly and annual compensation costs  after the adoption of sfas r  could increase by million and million  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the actual expense recognition upon adoption of sfas r will not exceed these estimates

the following table provides our revenue by segment  for the years ended june  and for the year ended june  in thousands increase decrease between periods revenues as of total revenues as of total revenues change licensed technology outsourced solutions tailored solutions during  we experienced revenue increases in our licensed technology and outsourced solutions segments 
the increase in licensed technology segment revenues were driven principally by the revenue contribution from the uk as a result of the bacstel ip initiative  a full year s revenue contribution from createform and increases in foreign exchange rates 
the increase in outsourced solutions revenues was primarily the result of increased revenue from our legal exchange product in the us and from the revenue contribution of hmsl which we acquired in april we expect that revenues for each of our reportable segments will increase during revenues by category fiscal year ended june  increase decrease between periods compared to in thousands revenues software licenses service and maintenance equipment and supplies total revenues the overall revenue increase in was due primarily to growth being driven by the bacstel ip opportunity in the uk  a full year s revenue contribution from createform  increases in the foreign exchange rate in the uk and the revenue contribution from our april acquisition of hmsl  offset in part by a decrease in sales of certain of our legacy payment offerings

software licenses 
the increase in software license revenues was due principally to the increased contribution of revenue from the uk as a result of the bacstel ip initiative and  to a lesser extent  a full year s revenue contribution from createform and an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
this 
table of contents increase was partially offset by a decrease in our webseries licenses in the us and  to a lesser extent a decrease in license fees from certain of our legacy payment products 
based on current plans  we anticipate that software license revenues will increase in fiscal year service and maintenance 
the increase in service and maintenance revenues was due to an increase in professional services revenues in the uk related to bacstel ip deployments  an increase in revenues from our legal exchange product in the us  a full year s revenue contribution from createform and from the revenue contribution of hmsl  partially offset by a decrease in the professional services associated with certain of our legacy products in the us 
based on current plans  we anticipate that service and maintenance revenues will increase in fiscal year equipment and supplies 
the decrease in equipment and supplies revenues was due principally to our continued de emphasis of sales efforts for lower margin products and the continued migration of us and uk customers to our web based products and solutions  which are not equipment and supplies intensive  offset in part by an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
we anticipate that equipment and supplies revenues will remain relatively constant during cost of revenues fiscal year ended june  increase decrease between periods compared to in thousands cost of revenues software licenses service and maintenance equipment and supplies total cost of revenues gross profit software licenses

software license costs remained comparable at of software license revenues for the fiscal years ended june  and the increase in software license cost of revenues in dollar terms was proportional to the increase in software license revenues 
based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year software license costs  as a percentage of revenues  will approximate fiscal year levels 
service and maintenance 
service and maintenance costs include salaries and other related costs for our customer service  maintenance and help desk support staffs  as well as third party contractor expenses used to complement our professional services teams 
service and maintenance costs remained comparable at of service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to of service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended june  the dollar increase in service and maintenance costs over the prior year was primarily the result of higher implementation costs in the uk as a result of the bacstel ip initiative  a full year s expense contribution of createform  expenses of hmsl and an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
equipment and supplies 
equipment and supplies costs include the costs associated with equipment and supplies that we resell  as well as freight  shipping and postage costs associated with the delivery of our products 
equipment and supplies costs decreased to of equipment and supplies revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to of equipment and supplies revenues in the fiscal year ended june  the 
table of contents decrease in equipment and supplies costs as a percentage of equipment and supplies revenues was due primarily to decreases in delivery related costs in the uk  which typically carry no gross margin  and an improvement on the gross margin yield of certain us products

operating expenses fiscal year ended june  increase decrease between periods compared to in thousands operating expenses sales and marketing product development and engineering product development and engineering in process research and development stock compensation expense general and administrative amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  public relations  marketing materials and trade shows 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to increased commission costs as a result of higher revenues  a full year s expense contribution of createform  two months of expense contribution from hmsl  increases in customer conferences and trade show events and increases in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will decrease  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal year product development and engineering 
product development and engineering expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development  which continues to be focused on enhancements and revisions to our products based on customer feedback and general marketplace demands  and expenditure levels remained relatively comparable on a year over year basis

in connection with our acquisition of flashpoint in august  we assumed all of the outstanding common stock options of flashpoint  which were exchanged for our common stock options  and recorded deferred compensation of million at the date of acquisition relating to the intrinsic value of the unvested options 
the deferred compensation was amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period of the options 
the decrease in stock compensation expense was due principally to the forfeiture of unvested stock options as a result of employee separations 
at june  the expense associated with these options had been fully amortized 
in  we expect a significant increase in stock compensation expense based on our adoption of sfas r on july  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting services 
the increase in general and 
table of contents administrative expenses was primarily attributable to compensation cost increases  increased costs associated with sarbanes oxley act compliance and an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
to a lesser extent  the increase was driven by a full year s expense contribution from createform and two months of expense associated with hmsl 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal year amortization of intangible assets 
the decrease in amortization expense was due principally to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized during we anticipate that amortization expense will approximate million for fiscal year other income expense  net fiscal year ended june  increase decrease between periods compared to in thousands interest income interest expense other income expense  net other income  net interest income 
the increase in interest income in was attributable to an increase in rates of return during the year and an increase in our average investment balances throughout the year

other income expense  net consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses and  for  losses on our equity investments 
the other income expense  net included impairment losses on our equity investments  which we judged to be other than temporary  in the amount of  for the fiscal year ended june  there were no such impairment charges recorded during the investments are in non public entities accounted for under the cost method 
the carrying value of all of our equity investments was approximately  at june  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for fiscal consists of a net us tax benefit of  and tax expense associated with our foreign operations of  for a consolidated tax expense of  the net tax benefit recorded in the us is due to a tax refund that we recorded during we do not expect this type of benefit to reoccur in subsequent years 
for fiscal  our tax expense consisted of a small amount of state tax expense in the us  which we incurred irrespective of our net operating loss position  and a provision for income taxes in australia 
based on our current level of operations we may achieve  by the end of fiscal  three years cumulative pre tax income  which under sfas  accounting for income taxes  will require a review of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance to evaluate whether such an allowance is still required 
at june  a full valuation allowance has been maintained on our deferred tax assets associated with our us and uk operations  since it was deemed more likely than not these assets would not be realized 
our deferred tax assets associated with our australian operations have been fully valued at june   as we expect these assets to be realized by our australian subsidiaries 

table of contents if  based on the operating results of and our review of the realizability of our deferred tax assets we were to conclude that some or all of our deferred tax asset reserves were not required  this would likely have a material impact on our financial results  in the form of reduced tax expense 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve cumulative profitability during or that any reduction of our deferred tax asset reserves will actually occur next year 
net income 
the achievement of net income for was primarily due to our revenue growth and our ability to manage expenses  decreases in amortization expenses of intangible assets and the absence of charges associated with in process research and development

in process research and development of  in the fiscal year ended june  represents the expense associated with acquired in process research and development of createform of  and abm of  there was no comparable expense in the fiscal year ended june  the in process research and development projects were valued using an income approach  which included the application of a discounted cash flow methodology 
using this methodology  the value of in process technology is comprised of the total present value of the future cash flow stream attributable to this technology over its anticipated life 
as a basis for the valuation process  we made estimates of the revenue stream to be generated in each future period and the corresponding operating expenses and other charges  such as income taxes  that will be incurred to support this revenue stream 
based upon these assumptions  the projected cash flow streams relating to the in process research and development were discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
stock compensation expense 
in connection with our acquisition of flashpoint in august  we assumed all of the outstanding common stock options of flashpoint  which were exchanged for our common stock options  and recorded deferred compensation of million at the date of acquisition relating to the intrinsic value of the unvested options 
the deferred compensation is being amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period of the options 
the decrease in stock compensation expense was due principally to the forfeiture of unvested stock options as a result of employee separations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting services 
the increase in general and 
table of contents administrative expenses was the result of the expense contribution from createform and an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk  partially offset by lower personnel costs in the us and in the uk resulting from headcount reductions and reduced facility costs in the us as a result of closing certain offices 
amortization of intangible assets 
the decrease in amortization expense was due principally to certain intangible assets of bottomline europe that became fully amortized in the three months ended september  other income expense  net fiscal year ended june  increase decrease between periods compared to in thousands interest income interest expense other  net other income expense  net interest income 
the decrease in interest income was attributable to a decrease in the rate of return  due to declining interest rates  on our investments during fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense relates predominantly to interest associated with a promissory note that we assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of evelocity in may the third and final principal and interest payment on this promissory note was made on february other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses and losses on our equity investments 
the other income expense  net included impairment losses on our equity investments  which we judged to be other than temporary  in the amounts of  and  in the fiscal years ended june  and june  the investments are in non public entities accounted for under the cost method 
the carrying value of all of our equity investments was approximately  at june  and  at june  provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes consists of a small amount of us state tax expense  which will be incurred irrespective of our net operating loss position  and a provision for income taxes in australia 
for the fiscal year ended june   our income tax loss carry back had been fully utilized 
accordingly  we have maintained a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets since  based on the available evidence  we believe that our deferred tax assets are less likely  rather than more likely  to be realized 
net loss 
the decrease in the net loss was primarily due to the contribution of revenue from createform  an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk  cost control initiatives undertaken in recent fiscal years and the adoption of sfas under which goodwill is no longer subject to recurring amortization 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities and the sale of our common stock 
we had net working capital of million at june   including cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
in addition  in july we completed a secondary offering of our common stock generating proceeds  after underwriting discounts  of approximately million

table of contents given that we have no long term debt obligations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future

we also may undertake additional business or asset acquisitions 
operating activities fiscal year ended june  in thousands net income loss non cash adjustments decrease increase in accounts receivable all other  net net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to the generation of net income and increases in deferred revenue

net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by the net loss after non cash items 
as of june  and  our deferred tax assets associated with our us and uk operations had been fully reserved since  given the available evidence  it was deemed more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would not be realized

certain factors that may affect future results investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision involving our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could fall  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
our common stock has experienced and may continue to undergo extreme market price and volume fluctuations stock markets in general  and the nasdaq stock market in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in recent years 
broad market fluctuations of this type may adversely affect 
table of contents the market price of our common stock 
the stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that often have been unrelated to their operating performance 
the market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to undergo extreme fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including general and industry specific business  economic and market conditions  actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  including those arising as a result of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets related to past or future acquisitions  changes in or our failure to meet analysts or investors estimates or expectations  public announcements concerning us  including announcements of litigation  our competitors or our industry  introductions of new products or services or announcements of significant contracts by us or our competitors  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  or capital commitments by us or our competitors  adverse developments in patent or other proprietary rights  and announcements of technological innovations by our competitors 
our fixed costs may lead to operating results below analyst or investor expectations if our revenues are below anticipated levels  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock a significant percentage of our expenses  particularly personnel and facilities costs  are relatively fixed and based in part on anticipated revenue levels 
in recent years we experienced slowing growth rates with certain of our licensed software products 
a decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expense growth could negatively affect our business 
significant revenue shortfalls in any quarter may cause significant declines in operating results since we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner 
quarterly operating results that are below the expectations of public market analysts could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
factors that could cause fluctuations in our operating results include the following economic conditions  which may affect our customers and potential customers budgets for information technology expenditures  the timing of orders and longer sales cycles  the timing of product implementations  which are highly dependent on customers resources and discretion  the incurrence of costs relating to the integration of software products and operations in connection with acquisitions of technologies or businesses  and the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by either us or our competitors 
because of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
our mix of products and services could have a significant effect on our financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock the gross margins for our products and services vary considerably 
our software revenues generally yield significantly higher gross margins than do our service  maintenance  and equipment and supplies revenue 
table of contents streams 
in recent fiscal years we experienced a decrease in our software license fees  particularly in the us 
if software license fees were to again decline  or if the mix of our products and services in any given period does not match our expectations  our results of operations and the market price of our common stock could be significantly affected 
the demand for our bacstel ip product in the uk  which is currently generating significant revenue growth  is expected to decline after the uk mandated conversion date for this new technology has passed 
we have experienced  and are continuing to experience  strong market demand in the uk as a result of demand for our products that address the new payment standard for electronic payments in the uk called bacstel ip 
under the existing regulatory requirements  uk businesses have until the end of december to be in compliance with this standard 
there is a possibility that the current deadline could be extended 
if the deadline is extended  it could extend or delay customer buying decisions  potentially having an impact on our operating results  in which case our stock price could be materially and adversely affected 
we plan to introduce new products to the uk market at the conclusion of the bacstel ip initiative 
in addition  we offer the current bacstel ip solution on a subscription basis to a portion of our customers  which we expect will generate ongoing recurring revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that the combination of new product sales and recurring subscription revenues will be sufficient to offset the revenue from our bacstel ip products in which case our operating results and stock price could be materially and adversely affected 
we face risks associated with our international operations that could harm our financial condition and results of operations in recent periods  a significant percentage of our revenues have been generated by our international operations  and our future growth rates and success are in part dependent on our continued growth and success in international markets 
we have operations in the us  uk and australia 
as is the case with most international operations  the success and profitability of these operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that include  in addition to the risks our business as a whole faces  the following difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  differing regulatory and industry standards and certification requirements  the complexities of foreign tax jurisdictions  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and import or export licensing requirements 
a significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from our payment management offerings and our performance will depend on continued market acceptance of these solutions a significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from the license and maintenance of our payment management offerings and sales of associated products and services 
any significant reduction in demand for our payment management offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future performance could depend on the following factors continued market acceptance of our payment management offerings as a payment management solution  prospective customers dependence upon enterprises seeking to enhance their payment functions to integrate electronic payment capabilities  
table of contents our ability to introduce enhancements to meet the market s evolving needs for secure payments and cash management solutions  and continued acceptance of desktop and enterprise software  and laser check printing solutions 
our future financial results will depend on our ability to manage growth effectively in the past  rapid growth has strained our managerial and other resources 
if rapid growth resumes  our ability to manage that growth will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our operating  financial and management information systems 
presently we are experiencing significant revenue growth and increasing product demand in the uk as a result of the bacstel ip conversion 
while we believe that this creates a significant opportunity  our ultimate ability to capitalize on this opportunity will be dependent on our ability to effectively manage our bacstel ip product deployment  including product installations 
we cannot assure you that our personnel  systems and controls will be adequate to support future growth 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  the quality of our services  our ability to retain key personnel and our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our future financial results will be affected by the acceptance of electronic invoice presentment product offerings in an emerging market our electronic invoice presentment business model is in the early stages of market adoption  even though the product has been generally available from us and our competitors for some time 
customers and potential customers may not be ready to adopt our electronic invoice presentment business model  or may be slower to adopt the model than we  or the public market analysts  anticipate 
if this emerging market does not adopt our business model or the market does not respond as quickly as we expect  our future results could be materially and adversely affected 
we face significant competition in our targeted markets  including competition from companies with significantly greater resources in recent years we have encountered increasing competition in our targeted markets 
we compete with a wide range of companies  ranging from small start up enterprises with limited resources  which compete principally on the basis of technology features or specific customer relationships  to large companies  which can leverage significant customer bases and financial resources 
given the size and nature of our targeted markets  the implementation of our growth strategy and our success in competing for market share generally may be dependent on our ability to grow our sales and marketing capabilities and maintain a critical level of financial resources 
integration of acquisitions could interrupt our business and our financial condition could be harmed we have made several acquisitions of companies and assets in the past  including our acquisitions of createform and abm during fiscal  and hmsl during fiscal and may  in the future  acquire or make investments in other businesses  products or technologies 
any acquisition or strategic investment we have made in the past or may make in the future may entail numerous risks  including the following difficulties integrating acquired operations  personnel  technologies or products  inadequacy of existing operating  financial and management information systems to support the combined organization or new operations  write offs related to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  entrance into markets in which we have no or limited prior experience or knowledge  diversion of management s focus from our core business concerns  
table of contents dilution to existing stockholders and earnings per share  incurrence of substantial debt  and exposure to litigation from third parties  including claims related to intellectual property or other assets acquired or liabilities assumed 
any such difficulties encountered as a result of any merger  acquisition or strategic investment could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of our acquisitions  we could be subject to significant future write offs with respect to intangible assets  which may adversely affect our future operating results we review our intangible assets  including goodwill  periodically for impairment 
at june   the carrying value of our goodwill and our other intangible assets was million and million  respectively 
while we reviewed our goodwill and intangible assets during our fourth quarter of fiscal year and concluded that there was no impairment  we could be subject to future impairment charges with respect to these intangible assets  or intangible assets arising as a result of additional acquisitions in future periods 
such charges  to the extent occurring  would likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
the slowdown in the economy experienced in recent fiscal years has affected the market for information technology solutions  including our products and services  and if this slowdown continues our future financial results could be materially adversely affected as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending by our customers and potential customers  demand for certain of our licensed software products and services has been adversely affected 
in recent years  this has resulted in decreased revenues  particularly software license revenues  and a decline in our historic growth rate 
to date  the us marketplace has been particularly affected but there can be no assurance that this trend will not extend  to the same degree  to the uk marketplace where we also have significant operations 
our future results will be materially and adversely affected if this slowdown continues or worsens and our revenues continue to be adversely impacted 
during recent fiscal years  we implemented several cost reduction initiatives in an attempt to improve our profitability 
if current economic conditions continue or worsen  those cost reductions may prove to be inadequate and we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we depend on key employees who are skilled in e commerce  payment  cash and document management and invoice presentment methodology and internet and other technologies our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and key technical employees who are skilled in e commerce  payment methodology and regulation  and internet  database and network technologies 
the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we currently do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our employees 
while some of our executive officers have employment or retention agreements with us  the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must attract and retain highly skilled personnel with knowledge in e commerce  payment  cash and document management and invoice presentment methodology and internet and other technologies we believe that our success is in part dependent upon our ability to attract  hire  train and retain highly skilled technical  sales and marketing  and support personnel  particularly with expertise in e commerce  payment  cash management and invoice methodology and internet and other technologies 
competition for qualified personnel is intense 
as a result  we may experience increased compensation costs that may not be 
table of contents offset through either improved productivity or higher sales prices 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting  recruiting or retaining existing personnel 
based on our experience  it takes an average of nine months for a salesperson to become fully productive 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in increasing the productivity of our sales personnel  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
an increasing number of large and more complex customer contracts  or contracts that involve the delivery of services over contractually committed periods  may delay the timing of our revenue recognition and affect our operating results  financial condition and the market price of our stock due to an increasing number of large and more complex customer contracts  we have experienced  and will likely continue to experience  delays in the timing of our revenue recognition 
these large and complex customer contracts generally require significant implementation work  product customization and modification resulting in the recognition of revenue over the period of project completion  which normally spans several quarters 
additionally  certain of our products and services are sold on a hosted basis  which can involve contractually defined service periods 
in such cases  revenue is typically recorded over the expected life of the arrangement  rather than at the outset of the arrangement  thus lengthening the period of revenue recognition 
delays in revenue recognition on these contracts could affect our operating results  financial condition and the market price of our common stock 
increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our product solutions the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
some competitors in our targeted markets have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  and marketing resources  greater brand recognition and a larger installed customer base than we do 
we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the markets we address 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to expand their product offerings and to offer more comprehensive solutions 
this growing competition may result in price reductions of our products and services  reduced revenues and gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced software  services and strategic partner relationships the markets in which we compete are subject to rapid technological change and our success is dependent on our ability to develop new and enhanced software  services and strategic partner relationships that meet evolving market needs 
trends that could have a critical impact on us include the adoption of the newly mandated bacstel ip electronic payment format in the uk marketplace  which refers to the payments technology upgrade mandated by uk bacs bankers automated clearing services  which could cause delay and uncertainty with our customers and potential customers purchase decisions  other evolving industry standards  mandates and laws  such as those mandated by the national automated clearing house association and the association for payment clearing services  rapidly changing technology  which could cause our software to become suddenly outdated or could require us to make our products compatible with new database or network systems  developments and changes relating to the internet that we must address as we maintain existing products and introduce any new products  and the loss of any of our key strategic partners who serve as a valuable network from which we can leverage industry expertise and respond to changing marketplace demands 

table of contents there can be no assurance that technological advances will not cause our technology to become obsolete or uneconomical 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products  or enhancements to existing products  in a timely and successful manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
similarly  if we were to lose support from any of our key strategic partner relationships  our results could be negatively affected 
our products could be subject to future legal or regulatory actions  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results our software products and hosted services offerings facilitate the transmission of business documents and information including  in some cases  confidential financial data related to payments  invoices and cash management 
our web based software products  and certain of our hosted services offerings  transmit this data electronically 
while we believe that all of our product and service offerings comply with current regulatory and security requirements  there can be no assurance that future legal or regulatory actions will not impact our product and service offerings 
to the extent that regulatory or legal developments mandate a change in any of our products or services  or alter the demand for or the competitive environment of our products and services  we might not be able to respond to such requirements in a timely or successful manner 
if this were to occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
any unanticipated performance problems or bugs in our product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results if the products that we offer do not continue to achieve market acceptance  our future financial results will be adversely affected 
since many of our software solutions are still in early stages of adoption and since most of our software products are continually being enhanced or further developed in response to general marketplace demands  any unanticipated performance problems or bugs that we have not been able to detect could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  negative publicity regarding us and our products  harm to our customer relationships and exposure to potential liability claims 
in addition  if our products do not enjoy wide commercial success  our long term business strategy will be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could incur substantial costs resulting from warranty claims or product liability claims our software license agreements typically contain provisions that afford customers a degree of warranty protection in the event that our software fails to conform to its written specifications 
these agreements typically contain provisions intended to limit the nature and extent of our risk of warranty and product liability claims 
there is a risk  however  that a court might interpret these terms in a limited way or could hold part or all of these terms to be unenforceable 
furthermore  some of our licenses with our customers are governed by non us law  and there is a risk that foreign law might provide us less or different protection 
while we maintain general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  we cannot be sure that our existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims 
although we have not experienced any material warranty or product liability claims to date  a warranty or product liability claim  whether or not meritorious  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and our resources  which could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and could be subject to litigation regarding our intellectual property rights  causing serious harm to our business we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws and non disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we cannot assure you 
table of contents that our patents  pending applications for patents that may issue in the future  or other intellectual property will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology or any commercial advantage to us  or that the patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
we enter into agreements with our employees and customers that seek to limit and protect the distribution of proprietary information 
despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that such rights will remain protected or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we may be a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights or as a result of an alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
these claims  whether or not meritorious  could require us to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product implementations  develop non infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claim 
these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may incur significant costs from class action litigation as a result of expected volatility in our common stock in the past  companies that have experienced market price volatility of their stock have been the targets of securities class action litigation 
in august  we were named as a party in one of the so called laddering securities class action suits relating to the underwriting of our initial public offering 
we could incur substantial costs and experience a diversion of our management s attention and resources in connection with such litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to financial risk  including changes in interest rates  relates primarily to cash and cash equivalents and our short term investments 
these investments bear interest at a variable interest rate  which is subject to market changes

our investment portfolio consists of demand deposit accounts  money market mutual funds  us treasury securities  corporate debt securities and debt securities issued by us state agencies and institutions 
due to the short term average maturity of the investment portfolio  a sudden sharp change in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the value of the portfolio
