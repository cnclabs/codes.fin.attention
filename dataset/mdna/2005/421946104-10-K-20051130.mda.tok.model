item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business overview healthcare realty trust incorporated the company operates under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  as an indefinite life real estate investment trust reit 
the company  a self managed and self administered reit  integrates owning  managing and developing income producing real estate properties and mortgages associated with the delivery of healthcare services throughout the united states 
management believes that by providing related real estate services  the company can differentiate its competitive market position  expand its asset base and increase revenues over time 
substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from rentals on its healthcare real estate properties  from interest earned on mortgage loans  and from revenues from the consolidation of variable interest entities vies related to the operations of six senior living facilities owned by the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding these vies 
the company typically incurs operating and administrative expenses  including compensation expense  office rental and other related occupancy costs  as well as various expenses incurred in connection with managing the existing portfolio and acquiring additional properties 
the company also incurs interest expense on its various debt instruments and depreciation expense on its real estate portfolio 
executive overview the company continues to be well positioned from a capital structure and liquidity viewpoint by maintaining a conservative debt to book capitalization ratio  by maintaining capacity on its unsecured credit facility due million outstanding with million remaining capacity as of december  under its financial covenants  and by continuing to review and restructure maturities on its debt commitments no significant repayments on long term debt until the year 
as of september   the company had million outstanding on its unsecured credit facility due and had borrowing capacity remaining  under its financial covenants  of million 
since the company s inception  it has been selective about the properties it acquires 
management believes that by selecting conservative  long term investments with healthcare providers  the company will enhance its prospects for long term stability and maintenance of the dividend 
the company s portfolio  diversified by facility type  geography  and tenant concentration  helps mitigate its exposure to ever changing economic conditions and tenant and sponsor credit risks 
in the current market for medical office buildings  management has seen low capitalization rates and minimally accretive investment returns 
historically low interest rates and highly leveraged financial buyers have increased competition for medical office properties at higher prices 
several health systems have offered large portfolios of properties for sale  seeking to capitalize on these higher prices 
the properties acquired by the company during were mainly medical office buildings  on or near hospital campuses  and were part of large portfolios subject to competitive pricing 

table of contents during  the company purchased approximately million of real estate assets  began operating two medical office buildings that were previously under construction  publicly issued million of senior notes  and publicly issued  shares of common stock 
while these activities positioned the company very well from a liquidity and capital structure standpoint and developed and furthered relationships with healthcare systems  the combination of these activities will not have a significantly positive impact on funds from operations ffo or ffo per share for  largely because of the increased number of outstanding shares and the thin margin on medical office investments 
though the company is in discussions with healthcare systems on several development projects  its volume of acquisitions of existing medical office properties will not be as significant in as in offerings of large medical office portfolios have declined in as a result of rising interest rates affecting sales pricing 
with the acquisition and capital market activities consummated during and the reduced volume of acquisition activity in  management anticipates very little  if any  growth in its ffo per share during from property acquisitions 
the company  though historically having increased the dividend each quarter  decided to maintain the quarterly dividend for the third quarter of at the same level as the previous quarter 
the company will determine future dividend policy based upon cash generated by operating activities  the company s financial condition  relevant financing instruments  capital requirements  annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code  and other such factors deemed relevant 
the company has concluded that previously issued financial statements should be restated 
the restatement will have no impact on cash flows in future periods 
the results of operations for the three years in the period ended december  have been restated from the unaudited financial statements furnished on form k dated june  the results for the years ended december  and had previously been restated as disclosed in the unaudited financial statements furnished on form k dated june  these restatements impacted net income as shown in the table below

trends and matters impacting operating results management monitors factors and trends important to the company and reit industry in order to gauge the potential impact on the operations of the company 
discussed below are some of the factors and trends that management believes may impact future operations of the company 
acquisitions the company acquired approximately million of real estate properties during the company s volume of acquisitions for  however  will not be as high as in as of september  
table of contents  the company had invested in million of new properties or mortgages and had disposed of million of properties due to purchase options exercised 
purchase options exercised subsequent to year end on january   a senior living operator purchased nine of the ten properties it leased from the company producing net sales proceeds to the company totaling million  including the repayment of certain receivables  and purchased the tenth property in may producing net sales proceeds to the company totaling million  including the repayment of certain receivables 
the ten properties covered by the purchase options exercised by this operator comprise approximately million million  net of the company s real estate properties and accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended december  the company recognized a gain of approximately million in the first quarter of from the sale of the nine properties and recognized a gain of approximately million from the sale of the tenth property in the second quarter of on april   a second senior living operator purchased five properties it leased from the company producing net sales proceeds to the company totaling million  including the repayment of certain receivables 
the five properties covered by the purchase options exercised by this operator comprise approximately million million  net of the company s real estate assets and accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended december  the company recognized a gain of approximately million from the sale of the five properties 
as of september   the company had reinvested all of the proceeds from these two purchases by acquiring approximately million of new properties or mortgages 
however  since the proceeds were not reinvested immediately  net income for may be negatively impacted 
on september   a sponsor under a property operating agreement gave notice to the company of its intent to purchase three properties under property operating agreements with the company with a target closing date in december the three properties covered by the purchase options exercised by this operator comprise approximately million million  net of the company s real estate properties and accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended december  the company expects to recognize a gain from the sale of these properties 
on november   a lessee gave notice to the company of its intent to purchase  during the second quarter of  a medical office building it leases from the company under a master lease agreement 
based on the master lease agreement  the lessee s purchase price will be equal to the fair market value of the property  to be determined by an appraisal process specified in the master lease 
the property comprised approximately million million  net of the company s real estate properties at december  and accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended december  the company believes it will recognize a gain on the transaction 
the exercise of the purchase options noted above is largely a function of the historically low interest rate environment 
in each case  the operator or sponsor who able to replace higher rate lease or support obligations to the company with lower rate mortgage debt 
the company cannot predict whether additional purchase options will be exercised  but the company has not received notice of exercise of any other purchase options through november  investment trends as of september   approximately of the company s real estate investments consisted of properties currently leased to unaffiliated lessees pursuant to long term net lease agreements or subject to financial support agreements with the healthcare sponsors that provide guarantees of the return on the company s investment in the properties 
approximately are multi tenanted properties with shorter term occupancy leases  but without other financial support agreements 
the company s recent medical office real estate acquisitions have not included master lease or financial support arrangements with the health systems on whose campuses the acquired properties are located 
the income from these recent 
table of contents investments is derived solely from rents paid by the occupying tenants  which include physician practices and hospital operations 
the company expects future medical office investments to follow this trend  which the company believes gives it greater opportunity to manage long term revenue growth 
in addition to its medical office investments  the company also continues to see investment opportunities in the senior living sector of the healthcare industry 
the company may make additional acquisitions of senior living properties or invest in mortgage loans secured by senior living properties 
fas  discontinued operations as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  financial accounting standards board statement no 
fas  which has significantly impacted reits  requires that the company present all significant real estate disposals since december  as discontinued operations 
as a result  each time the company disposes of a significant real estate asset  the results of operations from that asset will be classified as discontinued operations for the current period  and all prior periods presented will be restated to conform to the current period presentation 
as a result  readers of the company s financial statements should be aware that each future disposal may result in a change to the presentation of the company s operations in the historical statements of income as previously filed 
such income statement reclassifications will have no impact on previously reported net income 
fas  business combinations as discussed in application of critical accounting policies and in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  when a building is acquired with in place leases  fas requires that the cost of the acquisition be allocated between the tangible real estate and the intangible assets related to in place leases based on their fair values 
where appropriate  the intangible assets recorded could include goodwill or customer relationship assets 
the value of above or below market in place leases is amortized against rental income or property operating expense over the average remaining term of the in place leases upon acquisition  which is typically a shorter period than the ordinary depreciation period for the building 
the value of at market in place leases is amortized and reflected in amortization expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
for the buildings acquired in and  the remaining lives of the in place leases ranged from to months 
variable interest entities included in the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and are the assets  liabilities and results of operations of variable interest entities vies related to six senior living properties owned by the company 
the company did not previously consolidate vies in its previously issued financial statements 
instead  the company reported depreciation on the real estate assets  which are included on the company s balance sheet  and reported rental income and interest income on the leases and notes receivable related to these assets  respectively 
the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vies  not previously identified or reported in previous filings to be vies by company management  were not consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements  and are part of the restatement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
due to prior operator defaults  the company placed new operators in the six senior living facilities during and and signed lease agreements with the new operators  in addition to loan agreements with one of the operators 
the company anticipated that the properties would not generate positive cash flows until the operations of the properties were stabilized 
as such  both parties agreed that the company would finance the estimated cash flow deficits  but in return would receive some or all of the economic benefits of the entities once the properties were stabilized and had positive cash flows 
these arrangements created a variable interest entity  as defined in fasb interpretation r  and in those cases where the company has subsequently determined that it is the primary beneficiary as defined by fasb interpretation r  the company is required to consolidate the vie in its consolidated financial statements 
this generally means that the note receivable  if any  from the vie on the books of the 
table of contents company  and the note payable  if any  to the company on the books of the vie  are eliminated in consolidation 
likewise  the interest income and rental income on the books of the company is eliminated against the corresponding interest expense and rental expenses on the books of the vie 
what remains in the consolidated financial statements of the company are the results of operations of the vie the properties  which are now included in the company s income statements in the lines other operating income and other operating expense  and the related assets and liabilities of the vie entity  which are included on the company s balance sheet 
if circumstances dictate  the structure of future transactions with operators may also create vies  resulting in consolidation of the entity s results of operations 
impairment charges as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  the company must assess the potential for impairment of our long lived assets  including real estate properties  whenever events occur or a change in circumstances indicate that the net carrying value might not be fully recoverable 
the company recorded impairment charges of million   and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the impairment charges in were recorded upon the disposition of real estate assets and included the write off of non cash straight line rent receivables 
the impairment charge in of million represents the difference between the net carrying value of million and the estimated fair value of million relating to a skilled nursing facility in oklahoma  which the company closed in and does not expect to reopen 
in  the sec issued a statement that impairment charges could not be added back to net income in calculating ffo 
as such  the million impairment charge recognized in related to the dispositions of real estate assets negatively impacted ffo 
impairment charges will be recognized from time to time and will negatively impact ffo 
funds from operations ffo and ffo per share are operating performance measures adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
nareit defines ffo as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a reit s operating performance equal to net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management believes ffo and ffo per share to be supplemental measures of a reit s performance that provide an understanding of the operating performance of the company s properties without giving effect to significant non cash items  primarily depreciation of real estate 
management uses ffo and ffo per share to compare and evaluate its own operating results from period to period  and to monitor the operating results of the company s peers in the reit industry 
the company reports ffo and ffo per share because these measures are observed by management to also be the predominant measures used by the reit industry and by industry analysts to evaluate reits  because ffo per share is consistently and regularly reported  discussed  and compared by research analysts in their notes and publications about reits  and finally  because research analysts publish their earnings estimates and consensus estimates for healthcare reits only in terms of fully diluted ffo per share and not in terms of net income or earnings per share 
for these reasons  management has deemed it appropriate to disclose and discuss ffo and ffo per share 
however  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 

table of contents ffo for the years ended december    and has been restated 
the restatement  discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  decreased increased ffo for the years ended december    and by million  million and million  respectively  and decreased increased ffo per diluted common share by  and  respectively

as discussed in application of critical accounting policies to accounting estimates and in note to the consolidated financial statements  when acquiring a real estate property  the company allocates a portion of the purchase price to lease intangibles in place upon acquisition as well as to the building 
the lease intangibles are amortized over the weighted average remaining lives of the leases in place upon acquisition  which is generally a much shorter life than the depreciation on the building asset

as of september   the company had reinvested all of the proceeds from these two purchases by acquiring approximately million of new properties or mortgages 
however  since the proceeds were not reinvested immediately  net income for may be negatively impacted 
on september   a sponsor under a property operating agreement gave notice to the company of its intent to purchase three properties under property operating agreements with the company with a target closing date in december the three properties covered by the purchase options exercised by this operator comprise approximately million million  net of the company s real estate properties and accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended december  the company expects to recognize a gain from the sale of these properties 
on november   a lessee gave notice to the company of its intent to purchase  during the second quarter of  a medical office building it leases from the company under a master lease agreement 
based on the master lease agreement  the lessee s purchase price will be equal to the fair market value of the property  to be determined by an appraisal process specified in the master lease 
the property comprised approximately million million  net of the company s real estate properties at december  and accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended december  the company believes it will recognize a gain on the transaction 
the exercise of the purchase options noted above is largely a function of the historically low interest rate environment 
in each case  the operator or sponsor was able to replace higher rate lease or support obligations to the company with lower rate mortgage debt 
the company cannot predict whether additional purchase options will be exercised  but the company has not received notice of exercise of any other significant purchase options through november  construction in progress as of december   the company had a net investment of approximately million in one development in progress  which has a total remaining funding commitment of approximately million 
the company received the certificate of occupancy during the second quarter of and is proceeding with construction of tenant improvements 
the company also has an investment in a land parcel of million in hawaii 
the company anticipates it will begin construction during on a medical office

the company intends to fund these commitments with internally generated cash flows  proceeds from the unsecured credit facility due  proceeds from the sale of additional assets  proceeds from additional repayments of mortgage notes receivable  or additional capital market financing 
dividends on january   the company declared an increase in its quarterly common stock dividend from per share annualized to per share annualized payable to shareholders of record on february  this dividend was paid on march  on april   the company declared an increase in its quarterly common stock dividend from per share annualized to per share annualized payable to shareholders of record on may  this dividend was paid on june  on july   the company declared an increase in its quarterly common stock dividend from per share annualized to per share annualized payable to shareholders of record on august  this dividend was paid on september  on november   the company declared its quarterly common stock dividend in the amount of per share annualized payable on december  to shareholders of record on november  the company  though historically having increased the dividend each quarter  decided to maintain the quarterly dividend for the third quarter of at the same level as the previous quarter 
the company will determine future dividend policy based upon cash generated by operating activities  the company s financial condition  relevant financing instruments  capital requirements  annual distributions required under the reit provisions of the code and other such factors deemed relevant 
liquidity the company plans to continue to meet its liquidity needs  including funding additional investments in  paying quarterly dividends  and funding debt service  with cash flows from operations  with proceeds from the unsecured credit facility due  proceeds of mortgage notes receivable repayments  and sales of real estate investments or additional capital market financing 
the company believes that its liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy its cash requirements 
the company cannot  however  be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to the company in sufficient amounts to meet its liquidity needs 
impact of inflation inflation has not significantly affected the company s earnings due to the moderate inflation rate in recent years and the fact that most of the company s leases and financial support arrangements require tenants and sponsors to pay all or some portion of the increases in operating expenses  thereby reducing the company s risk of the adverse effects of inflation 
because most of the company s leases and financial support arrangements also provide for annual increases equal to the rate of inflation  inflation will have the effect of increasing gross revenues under the terms of such leases and financial support arrangements 
leases and financial support arrangements vary in the remaining terms of obligations from one to twenty years  further reducing the company s risk of any adverse effects of inflation 
interest payable under the interest rate swaps and the unsecured credit facility due is calculated at a variable rate  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the swaps and the unsecured credit facility will be influenced by changes in short term rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
generally  changes in inflation and interest rates tend to move in the same direction 
during periods where interest rate increases outpace inflation  the company s operating results should be negatively impacted 
likewise  when increases in inflation outpace increases in interest rates  the company s operating results should be positively impacted 

table of contents market risk the company is exposed to market risk in the form of changing interest rates on its debt and mortgage notes receivable 
management uses regular monitoring of market conditions and analytical techniques to manage this risk 
the company has no market risk with respect to foreign currency fluctuations

application of critical accounting policies to accounting estimates the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to exercise judgments and make assumptions that impact the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reflected in the financial statements 
management routinely evaluates the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements 
these regular evaluations consider historical experience and other reasonable factors and use the seasoned judgment of management personnel 
management has reviewed the company s critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following paragraphs in this section describe the application of critical accounting policies by management to arrive at the critical accounting estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the company is a real estate investment trust that owns  manages and develops income producing real estate properties and mortgages throughout the united states 
many of the company s investments are subject to long term leases or other financial support arrangements with hospital systems and healthcare providers affiliated with the properties see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
due to the nature of the company s agreements  the company s accounts receivable  notes receivable and interest receivables result mainly from monthly billings of contractual tenant rents  lease guaranty amounts  note principal and interest amounts  mortgage interest  late fees and additional rent and interest 
payments on the company s accounts receivable are normally collected within days of billing  and payments on its mortgage notes and notes receivable are based on each note agreement 
when receivables remain uncollected  management must decide whether to provide an allowance for all or a portion of these receivables as uncollectible 
unlike a financial institution with a large volume of homogeneous retail receivables such as credit card loans or automobile loans that have a predictable loss pattern over time  the company s receivable losses have historically been infrequent and are tied to a unique or specific event 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is generally based on specific identification and is recorded for a specific receivable amount once determined that such an allowance is needed 

table of contents management monitors the aging and collectibility of accounts receivable on an ongoing basis 
at least monthly  a report is produced whereby all receivables are aged or placed into groups based on the number of days that have elapsed since the receivable was billed 
management reviews the aging report for evidence of deterioration in the timeliness of payment from a tenant or sponsor 
whenever deterioration is noted  management investigates and determines the reason s for the delay  which may include discussions with the delinquent tenant  sponsor  or borrower 
considering all information gathered  management s judgment must be exercised in determining whether a receivable is potentially uncollectible and  if so  how much or what percentage may be uncollectible 
among the factors management considers in determining uncollectibility are the type of contractual arrangement under which the receivable was recorded  eg  a mortgage note  a triple net lease  a gross lease  a sponsor guaranty agreement or some other type of agreement  tenant s or debtor s reason for slow payment  industry influences and healthcare segment under which the tenant or debtor operates  evidence of willingness and ability of the tenant or debtor to pay the receivable  credit worthiness of the tenant or debtor  collateral  security deposit  letters of credit or other monies held as security  tenant s or debtor s historical payment pattern  state in which the tenant or debtor operates  and existence of a guarantor and the willingness and ability of the guarantor to pay the receivable 
considering these factors and others  management must conclude whether all or some of the aged receivable balance is likely uncollectible 
upon determining that some portion of the receivable is likely uncollectible  the company records a provision for bad debt expense for the amount it expects will be uncollectible 
there is a risk that management s estimate is over or under stated  however  the company believes that this risk is mitigated by the fact that management re evaluates the allowance at least once each quarter and bases its estimates on the most current information available 
as such  any over or under statements in the allowance should be adjusted for as soon as new and better information becomes available 
the company monitors its mortgage notes and notes receivable balances much like it does a long lived asset 
if an event occurs  such as an operator risk profile change  or other circumstances indicate that the recorded value might not be fully recoverable  then the company would consider the need to reserve all or a portion of the note balance 
included in the company s consolidated financial statements are also receivables related to the company s vies 
these receivables consist primarily of patient receivables of the assisted living and skilled nursing facilities  which are billed and maintained by the operators of those facilities 
a significant portion of these receivables are due from medicare and medicaid and are generally collected within to days of billing  while the receivables due from private payors are generally collected in a shorter period of time 
the company reviews the aged delinquency reports  which age the receivables by patient or type of payor  to determine whether the company believes an allowance for uncollectible accounts in addition to the allowance provided for on the property s financial statements is needed in the company s financial statements 
as of december  and  the company s accounts receivable balances were approximately million and million  respectively  with allowances for uncollectible accounts of approximately million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded provisions for bad debt expense of million and million  respectively  and collected or wrote off receivables against the provision of million and million  respectively 
the company s notes receivable balances were approximately million and million  respectively as of 
table of contents december  and the company s receivables  notes receivable and related allowances are included in other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company s mortgage notes receivable balances were approximately million and million  respectively  as of december  and if management had used different estimates  or its methodology for determining and recording the allowance had been different  then the amount of bad debt expense included in the company s financial statements may have been different 
currently  the company has no collectibility issues with its two largest tenants  healthsouth and hca inc however  should a collectibility problem arise with respect to these large tenants  the allowance for doubtful accounts would be increased which could have a material impact on the company s financial statements in future periods 
depreciation of real estate assets and amortization of related intangible assets as of december   the company had invested approximately billion in real estate assets and related intangible assets 
when these real estate assets and related intangible assets are acquired or placed in service  they must be depreciated or amortized 
management s judgment involves determining which depreciation method to use  estimating the economic life of the building and improvement components of real estate assets  and estimating the value of intangible assets acquired when real estate assets are purchased that have in place leases 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  for real estate acquisitions subsequent to december   the company accounts for acquisitions of real estate properties with in place leases in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb fas no 
 business combinations 
fas requires that when a building is acquired with in place leases  the cost of the acquisition be allocated between the acquired tangible real estate assets as if vacant and any acquired intangible assets 
such intangible assets could include above or below market in place leases and at market in place leases  which could include the opportunity costs associated with absorption period rentals  direct costs associated with obtaining new leases such as tenant improvements  and customer relationship assets 
any remaining excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill 
the identifiable tangible and intangible assets are then subject to depreciation and amortization 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis unless circumstances suggest that a more frequent evaluation is warranted 
if management erred in its estimates of the as if vacant value of the building or in its estimates of the intangible asset values  the pro ration of the purchase price between building and intangibles and resulting depreciation and amortization could be incorrect 
the amortization period for the intangible assets is the average remaining term of the actual in place leases as of the acquisition date 
to help prevent errors in its estimates from occurring  management applies consistent assumptions with regard to the elements of estimating the as if vacant values of the building and the intangible assets  including the absorption period  occupancy increases during the absorption period  and tenant improvement amounts 
the company uses the same absorption period and occupancy assumptions for similar building types  adding the future cash flows expected to occur over the next years as a fully occupied building 
the net present value of these future cash flows  discounted using a market rate of return  becomes the estimated as if vacant value of the building 
with respect to the building component  there are several depreciation methods available under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
some methods record relatively more depreciation expense on an asset in the early years of the asset s economic life  and relatively less depreciation expense on the asset in the later years of its economic life 
the straight line method of depreciating real estate assets is the method we follow because  in the opinion of management  it is the method that most accurately and consistently allocates the cost of the asset over its estimated life 
the company has assigned a useful life of either or years depending on the age of the property when acquired as well as other factors 
the weighted average remaining life of the company s real estate assets as of december  was years 
many companies depreciate new non residential 
table of contents real estate assets over longer useful lives 
the company uses a shorter  more conservative  economic life because it believes it more appropriately reflects the economic life of the properties 
capitalization of costs accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for capitalization of various types of costs 
the rules and regulations on capitalizing costs and the subsequent depreciation or amortization of those costs versus expensing them in the period vary depending on the type of costs and the reason for capitalizing the costs 
direct costs generally include construction costs  professional services such as architectural and legal costs  travel expenses  land acquisition costs as well as other types of fees and expenses 
these costs are capitalized as part of the basis of an asset to which such costs relate 
indirect costs include capitalized interest and overhead costs 
the company s overhead costs are based on overhead load factors that are charged to a project based on direct time incurred 
the company computes the overhead load factors annually for its acquisition and development departments  which have employees who are involved in the projects 
the overhead load factors are computed to absorb that portion of indirect employee costs payroll and benefits  training  occupancy and similar costs that are attributable to the productive time the employee incurs working directly on projects 
the employees in the company s acquisitions and development departments who work on these projects maintain and track their hours daily  by project 
employee costs that are administrative  such as vacation time  sick time  or general and administrative time  are expensed in the period incurred 
the company capitalizes overhead based on direct hours worked on each project 
therefore  each constructed asset and pursuit project will have both direct and indirect costs capitalized to it as part of the overall costs 
management s judgment is also exercised in determining whether costs that have been previously capitalized in pursuit of an acquisition or development project should be reserved for or written off if the project is abandoned or should circumstances otherwise change that cause the project s viability to become questionable 
the company follows a standard and consistently applied policy of classifying pursuit activity as well as reserving for those types of costs based on their classification 
the company classifies its pursuit projects into four categories 
the first category of pursuits is essentially cold calls that have a remote chance of producing new business 
costs for these projects are expensed in the period incurred 
the second category includes those that might reasonably be expected to produce new business opportunities although there can be no assurance that they will result in a new project or contract 
costs for these projects are capitalized but  due to the uncertainty of projects in this category  these costs are reserved at which means that of the costs are expensed in the period incurred 
the third category are those pursuits that are either highly probable to result in a project or contract or already have resulted in a project or contract in which the contract requires the operator to reimburse our costs 
many times  these are pursuits involving operators with which the company is already doing business 
since the company believes it is probable that these pursuits will result in a project or contract  it capitalizes these costs in full and records no reserve 
the fourth category includes those pursuits that are acquisitions of existing buildings 
as required by the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the company expenses in the period incurred all internal costs related to those types of acquisitions 
each quarter  all capitalized pursuit costs are again reviewed carefully for viability or a change in classification and a management decision is made as to whether any additional reserve is deemed necessary 
if necessary and considered appropriate  management would record an additional reserve at that time 
capitalized pursuit costs  net of the reserve  are carried in other assets in the balance sheet and any reserve recorded is charged to general and administrative expenses on the income statement 
these pursuit costs will ultimately be written off to expense or will be capitalized as part of the constructed real estate asset 

table of contents as of december  and  the company had capitalized pursuit costs totaling million and million  respectively  and had provided reserves against these capitalized pursuit costs of million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the potential for impairment of identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets  including real estate properties  whenever events occur or a change in circumstances indicate that the recorded value might not be fully recoverable 
important factors that could cause management to review for impairment include significant underperformance of an asset relative to historical or expected operating results  significant changes in the company s use of assets or the strategy for its overall business  plans to sell as asset before its depreciable life has ended  or significant negative economic trends or negative industry trends for the company or its operators 
in addition  the company reviews for possible impairment to its assets subject to purchase options and those impacted by casualties  such as hurricanes 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  if management determined that the carrying value of the company s assets may not be fully recoverable based on the existence of any of the factors above  or others  management would measure and record impairment based on projected future cash flows 
the company recorded impairment charges of million   and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the impairment charges in were recorded upon the disposition of real estate assets and included the write off of non cash straight line rent receivables 
the impairment charge in of million represents the difference between the net carrying value of million and the estimated fair value of million relating to a skilled nursing facility in oklahoma  which the company closed in and does not expect to reopen 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company ceased amortizing goodwill as of january  in lieu of continued amortization  the company performs an annual goodwill impairment review 
the and reviews indicated no impairment in the million goodwill asset
