sales increased percent as we reported sales gains across all reportable segments 
approximately percent of the increase in sales was from organic growth  defined as sales from the company s businesses that have operating results in comparable periods presented 
both the marine engine and boat segment benefited from an improved marine market 
organic sales growth for the marine engine segment was largely due to higher wholesale shipments of outboard and sterndrive engines in domestic markets  as well as higher sales of gps based products at navman and higher wholesale shipments of outboard engines in international markets 
organic sales growth for the boat segment was due to higher shipments across most boat brands in both domestic and international markets due to the success of new products  increased customer demand  and favorable pricing 
organic sales growth for the fitness segment was the result of higher domestic and international commercial sales related to the success of new models 
organic sales growth for the bowling billiards segment was due to higher sales volume of bowling capital equipment and consumer products  as well as higher bowling center revenues and increased sales of billiard tables and equipment 
international sales increased million to  million in compared with  million in sales increased across all international locations with the largest impact coming from the europe  pacific rim and canada  which increased by million  million and million  respectively 
this increase is due to an increase in boat and outboard engine sales  the benefit of a weaker us dollar  and additional revenues associated with acquisitions 
gross margin percentage increased in compared with primarily due the favorable impact associated with and acquisitions  favorable pricing in the boat segment  increased sales of higher horsepower  higher margin engines  operational efficiencies due to higher production levels  the benefit of a weaker dollar  and successful cost reduction initiatives 
these factors were partially offset by higher compensation costs  a mix shift in outboard engines to lower margin  low emission engines  and a mix shift to lower margin strength equipment and higher materials costs in the fitness segment 
in addition  lower pension costs were mostly offset by higher healthcare and insurance costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a  as a percentage of net sales  decreased basis points in primarily due to the increase in sales volume 
sg a expenses increased by million to million in from million in this increase is attributable to the acquisitions completed in and  which accounted for approximately percent of the increase  higher compensation costs  and promotional expenses for new product launches 
operating earnings increased to million in from million in  excluding the previously mentioned litigation charge 
management believes that presentation of operating earnings in excluding this litigation charge provides a more meaningful comparison to current period results  because there was no comparable litigation charge in operating earnings 
the increase in operating earnings was primarily due to the increase in sales volumes in all reportable segments and the factors affecting gross margin percentage as described above 
these factors were partially offset by the increase in sg a expenses as discussed above  higher research and development expenses across most segments driven by acquisitions completed in and  and competitive pricing pressures in the asia pacific region in the marine engine segment 
operating earnings were also unfavorably affected by approximately million in compared with  primarily attributable to the marketing and production startup of the new verado family of four stroke outboard engines  start up and other expenses associated with the construction of an outboard engine assembly plant in china  and expenses to develop a new boat design process to better integrate engine and marine electronics into original boat designs 
interest expense increased by million to million in compared with million in primarily due to the issuance of new debt described in note  debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income increased to million in compared with million in  primarily due to improved results from joint venture investments  most notably the cummins mercruiser diesel marine llc joint venture 
the company s effective tax rate was reduced to percent in from percent in the lower effective tax rate for the year was primarily due to a reduction in tax reserves of approximately million arising from the completion of audit examinations of years to  and higher foreign and state earnings in lower effective tax rate jurisdictions 
excluding the million reduction in tax reserves  the company s effective tax rate for was percent 
management believes that the presentation of the effective tax rate in excluding this tax reserve reduction provides a more meaningful comparison to  because there was no comparable tax reserve reduction in average common shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share increased to million in from million in the increase in average diluted outstanding shares was due to the exercise of stock options and an increase in common stock equivalents due to an increase in the company s average stock price during the period 
vs 
sales increased percent as we reported sales gains across all reportable segments 
approximately percent of the increase in sales was from organic growth  defined as sales from the company s businesses that have months of reported operating results in both periods presented 
organic sales growth in the marine engine segment was due to higher revenues from international markets due in part to the weaker us dollar and higher sterndrive engine sales in the domestic and international markets 
organic boat segment sales increased due to higher wholesale shipments of smaller boats to dealers 
fitness segment sales increased primarily due to higher sales of domestic commercial fitness equipment and higher revenues from international markets due primarily to the weaker us dollar 
organic sales in the bowling billiards segment increased due to higher bowling center revenues 
sales from acquired businesses accounted for approximately percent of the increase in total sales 
acquisitions were made in all of the company s reportable segments during  the most significant of which were navman in the marine engine segment  land n sea and attwood in the boat segment  protokon in the fitness segment and valley dynamo in the bowling billiards segment 
international sales increased million to  million in compared with  million in sales increased across all reportable segments 
sales increased for in europe  the pacific rim and canada by percent  percent and percent  respectively 
this increase is due to the benefit of a weaker us dollar  an increase in boat sales and additional revenues associated with acquisitions 
in  gross margin percentages were affected by the favorable impact of a weaker us dollar  the higher gross margins associated with newly acquired businesses  the company s overall cost reduction efforts and improved operating and production efficiencies at the boat segment s us marine and sea ray divisions 
also  gross margins in benefited from the company standardizing its vacation policy across its divisions 
refer to note  standardization of vacation policy  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in pension  health care and insurance costs  higher sales of low horsepower and low emission outboard engines  which carry lower margins  severance and outplacement costs recorded in the marine engine segment  and unfavorable manufacturing variances in the fitness segment associated with the closing of the paso robles  california  facility and inefficiencies related to the transfer of production to and new product introductions at ramsey  minnesota 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased by basis points in compared with this increase is almost entirely attributable to the acquisitions completed in and  which accounted for approximately percent of the increase in sg a  and higher pension  health care and insurance costs 
these factors were offset by cost reduction activities across all reportable segments  and the standardization of the company s vacation policy mentioned above 
operating earnings and operating margins were negatively affected by the previously mentioned litigation charge in management believes that presentation of operating earnings excluding this charge provides a more meaningful comparison to because there was no comparable litigation charge that impacted operating earnings 
excluding this charge  operating earnings totaled million compared with million in and operating margins were percent in compared with percent in the increase in operating earnings was primarily due to the factors increasing sales described above  partially offset by higher sg a expenses and an increase in research and development spending  which was largely attributable to acquisitions for brunswick new technologies 
interest expense was million in and million in the decrease in was primarily attributable to a decline in the average outstanding debt level  and benefits from fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
see note  debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on interest rate swaps 
other income totaled million in compared with million in the increase in other income in was due to improved results from joint venture investments  most notably the cummins mercruiser diesel marine llc joint venture  and higher interest income from notes receivable  including notes related to the divestiture of the company s former outdoor recreation businesses 
see note  investments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on the company s joint ventures 
the company s effective tax rate was reduced to percent in from percent in due in part to the prepayment related to the united states tax court matter discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the prepayment  the company was no longer required to accrue interest costs associated with the united states tax court matter 
these net after tax interest costs were previously included in the income tax provision 
additionally  the company generated higher foreign and state earnings in lower effective tax rate jurisdictions 
average common shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share were million and million  in and  respectively 
the increase in average shares outstanding in was primarily due to the effect of stock options exercised

marine engine segment sales  which include the company s mercury marine and brunswick new technologies bnt operations  benefited from an increase in wholesale shipments of outboard and sterndrive engines in domestic markets due to an improved marine market  a full year impact of the navman acquisition and an increase in sales of parts and service businesses  which includes non traditional marine products  such as castings and rigging systems 
international sales also increased due to higher wholesale shipments of outboard engines and the benefit of a weaker us dollar 
operating earnings increased primarily due to the increase in sales volume  the impact of a weaker us dollar  additional revenues associated with sales of higher margin  higher horsepower engines  increased absorption of fixed costs due to higher production levels  and successful cost reduction initiatives 
these benefits were partially offset by higher compensation costs  a mix shift in outboard engines to lower margin  low emission engines  marketing and start up expenses and higher research and development expenses associated with the new verado family of four stroke outboard engines  start up and other costs associated with the construction of a new outboard engine manufacturing facility in china  higher research and development expenses associated with bnt  and competitive pricing pressures in the asia pacific region 
the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to investments in the new china plant for the production of four stroke outboard engines in the to horsepower range and a new verado manufacturing line at a facility in fond du lac  wisconsin 
vs 
marine engine segment sales increased primarily due to sales growth resulting from favorable currency trends related to a weaker us dollar  an increase in shipments of sterndrive engines in the domestic and international markets and higher parts and accessories sales 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in wholesale shipments of outboard engines in the domestic market due to increased foreign competition 
additionally  sales from acquisitions completed for bnt in and accounted for approximately percent of the increase in sales 
operating earnings for the segment in were comparable with in  operating earnings and margins were unfavorably impacted by higher pension  health care and insurance costs  lower production of outboard engines  which resulted in lower absorption of fixed costs  higher sales of low emission and low horsepower four stroke outboard engines  which carry lower profit margins  and severance related costs associated with salaried workforce reductions 
also contributing to the decline in operating margins were higher sg a and research and development expenses associated with bnt

sales from the lund  lowe  crestliner  attwood and land n sea acquisitions completed in and  accounted for approximately percent of the increase in segment sales 
organic sales growth resulted from higher wholesale shipments to boat dealers domestically and internationally  most notably for sea ray  bayliner and boston whaler  driven by an improved marine market  the successful introduction of new models  and favorable pricing 
the increase in operating earnings was primarily due to the increase in sales  the impact of acquisitions completed in and  favorable pricing  cost reduction initiatives and operational efficiencies 
also  operating earnings benefited from profitability at the segment s us marine division compared with operating losses in the prior year 
the turnaround in operating earnings for us marine was driven by higher domestic and international sales volume across most of its boat brands due to the success of new models  higher customer demand  and operational efficiencies due to the higher production levels 
boat segment operating earnings were unfavorably impacted by expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in and  an increase in compensation costs and higher research and development expenses  which were primarily associated with acquisitions completed in the increase in capital expenditures was primarily for tooling for the production of new models  expansion of a bayliner boat manufacturing plant in reynosa  mexico  and capital expenditures associated with the acquisitions completed in and vs 
the increase in sales was primarily due to higher wholesale shipments of smaller boats to dealers  most notably for bayliner runabouts and sea ray boats  as well as favorable pricing 
the higher wholesale shipments reflect a more normal purchasing pattern by dealers  whereas in  dealers curtailed purchases in an effort to reduce field inventories 
additionally  revenues from the land n sea and attwood acquisitions accounted for approximately percent of the increase in sales 
the increase in operating earnings in was due to higher sales volumes  cost reduction efforts and improved pricing partially offset by a sales mix shift toward smaller boats  which carry lower margins 
also benefiting the operating earnings comparison was reduced losses at the segment s us marine division  discussed below 
the overall performance of the boat segment was adversely affected in  and by operations at the company s us marine division  which manufactures bayliner  maxum and meridian pleasure boats and trophy offshore fishing boats 
operating losses for the division were million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively  compared with operating earnings of million in in and  losses at us marine were primarily due to sales reductions  operating inefficiencies associated with shifting boat production from five facilities closed throughout to remaining manufacturing plants  the launch of the meridian yacht brand  and the start up of a new plant in mexico to manufacture small boats 
the decrease in the operating loss from to was partially due to reduced discounting and higher sales 
the improvement from to is attributable to increased sales volumes  cost reduction efforts and reduced discounting  partially offset by the reinstatement of variable compensation 
capital expenditures in and were primarily related to investments in new and existing boat models  as well as projects to improve production efficiencies and product quality

these factors were partially offset by the increase in sales volume and successful cost containment efforts 
capital expenditures in were primarily for the expansion of a plant in hungary for the production of strength and cardiovascular equipment  including cross trainers  operational improvements and product expansion programs 
vs 
the increase in fitness segment sales was primarily due to increased domestic commercial sales to health club chains and the military  and higher international sales as a result of the weaker us dollar 
domestic commercial product sales benefited from share gains attributable in part to the success of new product and new model introductions  such as cardiovascular equipment and strength training systems 
the increase in sales was partially offset by decreased retail sales at the company s omni fitness stores as a result of various store divestitures  primarily on the west coast and in ohio 
the decline in operating earnings and operating margins was primarily attributed to the previously mentioned litigation charge 
management believes that presentation of operating earnings excluding this litigation charge provides a more meaningful comparison to prior period results because there was no comparable litigation charge that impacted operating earnings 
excluding this charge from the year to date comparison  operating earnings for the segment increased million  or percent  to million  and operating margins increased basis points to percent when compared with excluding the litigation charge  operating earnings increased primarily due to higher sales  lower warranty costs  lower compensation costs and cost reduction initiatives  partially offset by expenses and unfavorable manufacturing variances associated with the closing of the segment s paso robles  california  facility  inefficiencies related to the transfer of production to and new product introductions at an existing facility in ramsey  minnesota 
also offsetting the increase in operating earnings were royalty payments associated with the litigation settlement discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  and increased distribution and logistics costs related to domestic sales

sales from the valley dynamo acquisition completed in accounted for approximately percent of the increase in sales 
organic sales increased primarily due to increased sales volume of bowling equipment in both the domestic and international markets  driven by increased demand for new products  most notably the vector scoring system  center management systems and inferno bowling balls  and an increase in consumer products partially offset by a decrease in after market products 
in addition  the increase in sales was due to higher bowling center revenues  partially as a result of the opening of two new centers  and higher sales of billiard tables and equipment 
operating earnings benefited primarily from the higher sales volume  cost reduction programs and the recognition of a gain associated with the divestiture of three bowling centers 
this benefit was partially offset by increased expenses to support and promote new products  higher compensation costs and bad debt expense associated with the bankruptcy of a customer 
capital expenditures includes the construction of two new bowling centers  completed in the second quarter of  and the conversion of bowling centers to brunswick zones  which are modernized bowling centers that offer a full array of family oriented entertainment activities 
vs 
the increase in bowling billiards segment sales was primarily driven by additional revenues associated with the valley dynamo acquisition and increased bowling center revenues  partially offset by lower sales volumes of bowling capital equipment in domestic markets and lower sales of billiards products due to weaker consumer demand 
the increase in bowling billiards segment operating earnings was due to cost reduction activities  the benefit from the valley dynamo acquisition and the absence of impairment charges recorded in for european retail bowling centers 
these factors were partially offset by lower sales of bowling capital equipment and billiards products  increased research and development expenses  increased costs associated with upgrading retail bowling centers time and labor management systems  and higher pension expense

legal proceedings see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for disclosure of the potential cash requirements of environmental proceedings and other legal proceedings 
environmental regulation in its marine engine segment  the company will continue to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with present and future emissions requirements 
the costs associated with these activities and the introduction of low emission engines will have an adverse effect on marine engine segment operating margins and may affect short term operating results 
the boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities 
the company does not believe that compliance with federal  state  and local environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the company s reported results 
revenue recognition and sales incentives 
the company s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of marine engines  boats  fitness equipment  bowling products and billiard tables 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to customers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotional activities and rebates 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of the time of program communication to the customer or at the time of sale in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products 
the liability is estimated based on the costs for the incentive program  the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if actual costs are different from estimated costs  the recorded value of the liability would be adjusted 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible trade receivables based upon currently known bad debt risks and provides reserves based on past loss history  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of reserves 
the company also provides a reserve based on historical  current and estimated future purchasing levels in connection with its long term notes receivables for the company s supply agreements 
these assumptions are re evaluated if sufficient product purchases are not made 
changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other circumstance results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectibility of a specific account or note 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create more or less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories may need to be adjusted 
refer to note  significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the basis of accounting for inventories 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the liability is recorded using historical warranty experience to estimate projected claim rates and expected costs per claim 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates  and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
litigation 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to claims and litigation  including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures 
the company accrues for litigation exposure based upon its assessment  made in consultation with counsel  of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim 
in light of existing reserves  the company s litigation claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
if current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific claims are later determined to be inadequate  results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required 
the company records a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company establishes its reserve based on its best estimate within a range of losses 
if the company is unable to identify the best estimate  the company records the minimum amount in the range 
environmental 
the company accrues for environmental remediation related activities for which commitments or clean up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated 
all accrued amounts are generally determined in coordination with third party experts on an undiscounted basis and do not consider recoveries from third parties until such recoveries are realized 
the ultimate exposure for these claims is consistent with the prior year 
in light of existing reserves  the company s environmental claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for details of existing reserves 
self insurance reserves 
the company records a liability for self insurance obligations  which include employee related health care benefits and claims for workers compensation  product liability  general liability and auto liability 
the liability is estimated based on claims incurred as of the date of the financial statements 
in estimating the obligations associated with self insurance reserves  the company primarily uses loss development factors based on historical claim experience  which incorporate anticipated exposure for losses incurred  but not yet reported 
these loss development factors are used to estimate ultimate losses on incurred claims 
actual costs associated with a specific claim can vary from an earlier estimate 
if the facts were to change  the liability recorded for expected costs associated with a specific claim may need to be revised 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit reserves 
pension  postretirement and postemployment costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  the annual rate of increase in compensation for plan employees  the increase in costs of health care benefits and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit reserves are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  respectively 
refer to note  pension and other postretirement benefits  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the assumptions used and for changes in the accrued benefit 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred taxes are provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 
the company estimates its probable tax obligations based on historical experience and current tax laws and litigation 
the judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation  as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the company s interpretations of those laws and regulations 
these factors may cause the tax rate for the company to increase or decrease 
in the company reversed approximately million of tax reserves arising from the completion of audit examinations of years to see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion

the company estimates that the repatriation provision will have no effect on the company s amount of foreign earnings repatriations and related income taxes 
the company will continue to monitor the impact that any technical correction may have on the company 
forward looking statements certain statements in this annual report are forward looking as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements in this annual report may include words such as expect  anticipate  believe  may  should  could  or estimate 
these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations as of the date of this filing 
these risks include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  stock market performance and consumer confidence levels  and the impact on demand for the company s products  particularly in the united states and europe the company s revenues may be affected by weak domestic and international market conditions and the fluctuating stock market 
global political uncertainty may adversely affect consumer confidence during and beyond 
competitive pricing pressures across all of the company s product lines  introduction of lower priced alternatives by other companies can hurt the company s competitive position 
the company s efforts toward cost containment  commitment to quality products  and excellence in operational effectiveness and customer service are designed in part to offset this risk 
the company s ability to develop and produce competitive new products and technologies the company s continuing ability to introduce new products and technologies that succeed in the marketplace is key to the company s continued success 
the company s ability to maintain market share and volume in key high margin product lines  particularly in its marine engine segment the company derives a significant portion of its earnings from sales of higher margin products  especially in its marine engine business 
changes in sales mix to lower margin products  including low emission engines  as well as increased competition in these product lines  could adversely impact the company s future operating results 
the company is focusing on cost containment efforts  new product development and global sourcing initiatives  as well as operational improvements  to mitigate this risk 
the ability to maintain effective distribution the company sells the majority of its products through third parties such as dealers  retailers and distributors 
maintaining good relationships with superior distribution partners  and establishing new distribution channels  where appropriate  is key to the company s continued success 
the financial strength of dealers  distributors and independent boatbuilders and retailers as the main distribution channel for the company s products  dealer financial health is critical to the company s continued success 
in addition  a substantial portion of the company s engine sales are made to independent boatbuilders 
as a result  the company s financial results can be influenced by the availability of capital and the financial health of these independent boatbuilders 
certain of the company s fitness equipment and marine parts and accessories are sold through retail outlets 
as a result  the company s financial results can be affected by the availability of capital and financial health of these retailers 
the ability to maintain product quality and service standards expected by the company s customers the company s customers demand high quality products and excellent customer service 
the company s ability to meet these demands through continuous quality improvement across all of its businesses will significantly impact the company s future results 
inventory adjustments by the company  its major dealers  retailers and independent boatbuilders if the company s dealers and retailers  as well as independent boatbuilders who purchase the company s marine engine products  adjust their inventories downward  in response to weakness in retail demand  wholesale demand for the company s products diminishes 
in turn  the company s inventory reduction efforts have focused on reducing production  which results in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs and thus lower margins 
inventory reduction by dealers and customers can hurt the company s short term results of operations and limit the company s ability to meet increased demand when the us economy recovers 
the success of global sourcing and supply chain management initiatives the company has launched a number of initiatives to strengthen its sourcing and supply chain management activities 
the success of these initiatives will play a key role in the company s continuing ability to reduce costs 
the ability to successfully integrate acquisitions the company has acquired a number of new businesses since and intends to continue to acquire additional businesses to complement its existing product portfolio 
the company s success in effectively integrating these operations  including their financial  operational and distribution practices and systems  will affect the contribution of these businesses to the company s consolidated results 
the success of marketing and cost management programs the company is constantly subject to competitive pressures  particularly from asian competitors in the outboard engine market 
the company s continuing ability to respond to these pressures  particularly through cost containment initiatives and marketing strategies  is key to the company s continued success 
the company s ability to develop product technologies that comply with regulatory requirements the company s marine engine segment is subject to emissions standards that require ongoing efforts to bring the company s engine products in line with regulatory requirements 
the company believes that these efforts are on track and will be successful  but unforeseen delays in these efforts could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s ability to complete environmental remediation efforts and resolve claims and litigation at the cost estimated as discussed in part i  item above  the company is subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of operations 
these claims include several environmental proceedings  some of which involve costly remediation efforts over extended periods of time  as well as certain litigation matters which if not resolved in the company s favor  could require significant expenditures by the company 
the company believes that it is adequately reserved for these obligations  but significant increases in the anticipated costs associated with these matters could hurt the company s results of operations in the period or periods in which additional reserves or outlays are deemed necessary 
the impact of weather conditions on sales of marine products and retail bowling center revenues sales of the company s marine products are generally more robust just before and during spring and summer  and favorable weather during these months tends to have a positive effect on consumer demand 
conversely  poor weather conditions during these periods can retard demand 
in addition  severely inclement weather on weekends and holidays  particularly during the winter months  can adversely affect bowling retail center revenues 
changes in currency exchange rates the company manufactures its products predominately in the united states  though international manufacturing and sourcing are increasing 
a strong us dollar can make the company s products less price competitive relative to locally produced products in international markets 
the company is focusing on international manufacturing and global sourcing  in part  to offset this risk 
the recent trend of a weak us dollar has had a positive impact on international sales of the company s products 
adverse foreign economic conditions as the company continues to focus on international growth  it will become increasingly vulnerable to the effects of political instability  economic conditions and the possibility of military conflict in key world regions 
the effect of interest rates and fuel prices on demand for marine products the company s marine products  particularly boats  are often financed  and increases in interest rates can retard demand for these products and affect dealers cost of carrying inventory 
higher fuel costs can also hurt demand for the company s marine products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks in accordance with guidelines established by the company s management 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure related to transactions  and assets and liabilities that are subject to risk from foreign currency rate changes 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the euro  canadian dollar  british pound  australian dollar  japanese yen  and new zealand dollar 
hedging of anticipated transactions is accomplished with financial instruments whose maturity date  along with the realized gain or loss  occurs on or near the execution of the anticipated transaction 
hedging of an asset or liability is accomplished through the use of financial instruments such that the gain or loss on the hedging instrument offsets the gain or loss on the asset or liability 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effect that changes in interest rates have on the fair market value of the company s debt and to lower the company s borrowing costs 
the company s net exposure to interest rate risk is primarily attributable to fixed rate debt instruments 
interest rate risk management is accomplished through the use of fixed to floating interest rate swaps and floating rate instruments that are benchmarked to us and european short term money market interest rates 
raw materials used by the company are exposed to the effect of changing commodity prices 
accordingly  the company uses commodity swap agreements and futures contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials  including aluminum and natural gas 
the company uses a value at risk var computation to estimate the maximum one day reduction in pre tax earnings related to its foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price sensitive derivative financial instruments 
the var computation includes the company s debt  foreign currency hedge contracts  interest rate swap agreements  commodity swap agreements and futures contracts 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated reduction in fair market value that the company could incur on its derivative financial instruments from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates or commodity prices using the var estimation model 
the var model uses the monte carlo simulation statistical modeling technique and uses historical foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates and prices in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and includes substantially all market risk exposures 
the estimated potential losses shown in the table below  for a time period of one day and confidence level of percent  have no effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in millions risk category foreign exchange interest rates commodity prices the percent confidence level signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices could move in the company s favor 
the var model assumes that all movements in rates and commodity prices will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  as actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in global financial markets
