general overview we are a leading facilities based provider of low cost  high speed internet access and ip communications services 
our network is specifically designed and optimized to transmit data using ip 
ip networks are significantly less expensive to operate and are able to achieve higher performance levels than the traditional circuit switched networks used by our competitors  thus giving us clear cost and performance advantages in our industry 
we deliver our services to small and medium sized businesses  communications service providers and other bandwidth intensive organizations through over  customer connections in north america and europe 
our primary on net service is internet access at a speed of megabits per second  much faster than typical internet access currently offered to businesses 
we offer this on net service exclusively through our own facilities  which run all the way to our customers premises 
our network is comprised of in building riser facilities  metropolitan optical fiber networks  metropolitan traffic aggregation points and inter city transport facilities 
the network is physically connected entirely through our facilities to over buildings in which we provide our on net services  including over multi tenant office buildings 
we also provide on net services in carrier neutral colocation facilities  data centers and single tenant office buildings 
because of our integrated network architecture  we are not dependent on local telephone companies to serve our on net customers 
in addition to providing our on net services  we also provide internet connectivity to customers that are not located in buildings directly connected to our network 
we serve these off net customers using other carriers facilities to provide the last mile portion of the link from our customers premises to our network 
we emphasize the sale of on net services because sales of these services generate higher gross profit margins 
we believe our key opportunity is provided by our high capacity network  which provides us with the ability to add a significant number of customers to our network with minimal incremental costs 
our greatest challenge is adding customers to our network in a way that maximizes its use and at the same time provides us with a customer mix that produces strong profit margins 
we are responding to this challenge by increasing our sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  we may add customers to our network through strategic acquisitions 
we plan to expand our network to locations that can be economically integrated and represent significant concentrations of internet traffic 
we believe that the relative maturities of our north american and european operations will result in the majority of this expansion occurring in europe 
we may identify locations that we desire to serve with our on net product but cannot be cost effectively added to our network 
the key to developing a profitable business will be to carefully match the expense of extending our network to reach new customers with the revenue generated by those customers 
we believe the two most important trends in our industry are the continued growth in internet traffic and a corresponding decline in internet access prices 
as internet traffic continues to grow and prices per unit of traffic continue to decline  we believe our ability to load our network and gain market share from less efficient network operators will expand 
however  continued erosion in internet access prices will likely have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we have grown our net service revenue from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net service revenue is determined by subtracting our allowances for sales credit adjustments and unfulfilled purchase obligations from our gross service revenue 
we have generated our revenue growth through the strategic acquisitions of communications network assets and customers  primarily from financially distressed companies  the continued expansion of our network of on net buildings and the increase in customers generated by our sales and marketing efforts 
our net service revenue is derived from our on net  off net and non core services  which comprised  and of our net service revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  and  and for the year ended december  our on net service consists of high speed internet access and ip connectivity ranging from megabits per second to several gigabits per second of bandwidth 
we offer our on net services to customers located in buildings that are physically connected to our network 
off net services are sold to businesses that are connected to our network primarily by means of t  t  e and e lines obtained from other carriers 
our non core services  which consist of legacy services of companies whose assets or businesses we have acquired  include email  retail dial up internet access  shared web hosting  managed web hosting  managed security  voice services only provided in toronto  canada  point to point private line services  and services provided to lambdanet germany under a network sharing arrangement as discussed below 
we do not actively market these non core services and expect the net service revenue associated with them to continue to decline 
we have grown our gross profit from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our gross profit margin has expanded from in to for the year ended december  we determine gross profit by subtracting network operation expenses from our net service revenue other than amortization of deferred compensation 
the amortization of deferred compensation classified as cost of network services was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe that our gross profit will benefit from the limited incremental expenses associated with providing service to new on net customers 
we have not allocated depreciation and amortization expense to our network operations expense 
due to our strategic acquisitions of network assets and equipment  we believe we are positioned to grow our revenue base and profitability without significant additional capital investments 
we continue to deploy network equipment to other parts of our network to maximize the utilization of our assets without incurring significant additional capital expense 
as a result  our future capital expenditures will be based primarily on our planned expansion of on net buildings and the growth of our customer base 
we anticipate that our future capital expenditure rate will be less than our historical capital expenditure rate 
we plan to use part of the proceeds of our public offering  if consummated  to increase our number of on net buildings by approximately  primarily by adding carrier neutral facilities in europe  over the next months 
historically  our operating expenses have exceeded our net service revenue resulting in operating losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in each of these periods  our operating expenses consisted primarily of the following network operations expenses consist primarily of the cost of leased circuits  sites and facilities  telecommunications license agreements  network maintenance expenses  salaries of  and expenses related to  employees who are directly involved with maintenance and operation of our network  who we refer to as network employees 
selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses and related benefits paid to our non network employees and related selling and administrative costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses result from the depreciation of our property and equipment  including the assets and capitalized expenses associated with our network and the amortization of our intangible assets 
amortization of deferred compensation that results from the expense of amortizing the fair value of our stock options and restricted stock granted to our employees 
recent developments public offering on february   we filed a registration statement to sell up to million worth of shares of common stock in a public offering 
there can be no assurances that the offering will be completed 
equity conversion on february   the holders of our preferred stock converted all of their shares of preferred stock into shares of our common stock in the equity conversion 
as a result  we no longer have outstanding shares of preferred stock and the liquidation preferences on our preferred stock have been eliminated 
subordinated note on february   we issued a subordinated note in the principal amount of million to columbia ventures corporation 
the note was issued pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated february  columbia ventures corporation is owned by one of the company s directors and shareholders 
line of credit on march   we entered into a line of credit with a commercial bank 
the line of credit provides for borrowings of up to million and is secured by our accounts receivable 
the borrowing base is determined primarily by the aging characteristics related to our accounts receivable 
on march   we borrowed million against our north american accounts receivable under the line of credit 
of this amount million is restricted and held by the lender 
reverse stock split on march   we effected a for reverse stock split 
accordingly  all share and per share amounts in this report have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to this event 
building sale on march   we sold a building we owned located in lyon  france for net proceeds of approximately million 
this transaction resulted in a gain of approximately million 
acquisitions since our inception  we have consummated acquisitions through which we have generated revenue growth  expanded our network and customer base and added strategic assets to our business 
we have accomplished this primarily by acquiring financially distressed companies or their assets at a significant discount to their original cost 
the overall impact of these acquisitions on the operation of our business has been to extend the physical reach of our network in both north america and europe  expand the breadth of our service offerings  and increase the number of customers to whom we provide our services 
the overall impact of these acquisitions on our balance sheet and cash flows has been to significantly increase the assets on our balance sheet  including cash in the case of the allied riser merger  increase our indebtedness and increase our cash flows from operations due to our increased customer base 
a substantial portion of our historical growth in net service revenue has been generated by the customer contracts we have acquired 
we have historically experienced a decline in revenue attributable to acquired customers as these customers contracts have expired and they have entered into standard cogent customer contracts at generally lower rates or have chosen not to renew service with us 
we anticipate that we will experience similar declines with respect to customers we have acquired or will acquire 
verio acquisition in december  we acquired most of the off net internet access customers of verio inc  a leading global ip provider and subsidiary of ntt communications corp 
the acquired assets included over  customer connections located in of our us markets  customer accounts receivable and certain network equipment 
we assumed the liabilities associated with providing services to these customers including vendor relationships  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities 
we are integrating these acquired assets into our operations and onto our network 
acquisition of aleron broadband services in october  we acquired certain assets of aleron broadband services  formally known as agis internet  and million in cash  in exchange for  shares of our series m preferred stock  which converted into approximately million shares of our common stock in the equity conversion 
we acquired aleron s customer base and network  as well as aleron s internet access and managed modem service 
we are integrating these acquired assets into our operations and onto our network 
acquisition of global access in september  we issued shares of our series l preferred stock in exchange for the majority of the assets of global access telecommunications inc the series l preferred stock issued in the transaction converted into approximately million shares of our common stock in the equity conversion 
global access provided internet access and other data services in germany 
we acquired over customers in germany as a result of the acquisition and have completed the process of migrating these customers onto our network 
acquisition of ufo group  inc in august  we acquired certain assets of unlimited fiber optics  inc  or ufo  for  shares of our series k preferred stock 
the preferred stock issued in the merger converted into approximately million shares of our common stock in the equity conversion 
among these assets is ufo s customer base  which is comprised of data service customers located in san francisco and los angeles 
the acquired assets also included net cash of approximately million and customer accounts receivable 
we are in the process of integrating these acquired assets into our operations and onto our network and we expect to complete this integration in the second quarter of acquisition of european network in we expanded our operations into europe through a series of acquisitions in which we acquired customers and extended our network  primarily in france  spain  and germany 
in september  we began exploring the possibility of acquiring lng holdings sa  or lng  an operator of a european telecommunications network that was on the verge of insolvency 
we determined that an acquisition of lng in whole was not advisable at that time  however  the private equity funds that owned lng refused to consider a transaction in which we would acquire only parts of the network 
in order to prevent lng from liquidating and to preserve our ability to structure an acceptable acquisition  in november  our chief executive officer formed a corporation that acquired a interest in lng in return for a commitment to cause at least million to be invested in lng s subsidiary lambdanet france and an indemnification of lng s selling stockholders by us and the acquiring corporation 
in november  we reached an agreement with investment funds associated with bnp paribas and certain of our existing investors regarding the acquisition of the lng networks in france  spain and germany 
we completed the first step of the european network acquisition in january the investors funded a corporation that they controlled with million and acquired firstmark communications participation s 
rl  now named cogent europe s 
rl  the parent holding company of lambdanet france and lambdanet spain  from lng for one euro  or 
as consideration  the investors  through the corporation they controlled  entered into a commitment to use reasonable efforts to cause lng to be released from a guarantee of certain obligations of lambdanet france and a commitment to fund lambdanet france with million 
that corporation was then merged into one of our subsidiaries in a transaction in which the investors received  shares of series i preferred stock that converted into approximately million shares of our common stock in the equity conversion 
the planned second step of the transaction was the acquisition of the german network of lng 
we attempted to structure an acceptable acquisition that would have entailed using million allocated by the investors to restructure the existing bank debt of lambdanet germany  however  we subsequently concluded that it was unlikely that we could structure an acceptable acquisition of lambdanet germany and we began to seek an alternative german network acquisition in order to complete the european portion of our network and meet the conditions required to cause the investors to fund million 
in march  we identified network assets in germany formerly operated as part of the carrier network as an attractive acquisition opportunity 
pursuant to the november commitment  the investors funded a newly formed delaware corporation with million  and the corporation through a german subsidiary acquired the rights to certain assets of the carrier network in return for million euros  or million 
that corporation then was merged into one of our subsidiaries in a transaction in which the investors received shares of our series j preferred stock that converted into approximately million shares of our common stock in the equity conversion 
acquisition of assets of fiber network services in february  we acquired the principal assets of fiber network services  inc  or fnsi  an internet service provider in the midwestern united states  in exchange for options to purchase  shares of our common stock and the assumption of certain of fnsi s liabilities 
acquisition of psinet assets in april  we purchased the principal us assets of psinet  inc out of bankruptcy in exchange for million and the assumption of certain liabilities 
with the acquisition of psinet assets we began to offer our off net service and acquired significant non core services

as a result of the merger  allied riser became a wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with the merger  we became co obligor under allied riser s convertible subordinated notes 
results of operations our management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and potential variability of our net service revenues and cash flows 
these key performance indicators include net service revenues  which are an indicator of our overall business growth  gross profit  which is an indicator of both our service offering mix  competitive pressures and the cost of our network operations  growth in our on net customer base  which is an indicator of the success of our on net focused sales efforts  growth in our on net buildings  and distribution of revenue across our service offerings

the note is subordinated to the debt evidenced by the amended and restated cisco note  as well as our accounts receivable line of credit obtained in march management believes that the terms of the note are at least as favorable as those we would have been able to obtain from an unaffiliated third party 
line of credit on march   we entered into a line of credit with a commercial bank 
the line of credit provides for borrowings of up to million and is secured by our accounts receivable 
the borrowing base is determined primarily by the aging characteristics related to our accounts receivable 
on march   we borrowed million against our north american accounts receivable under the line of credit 
of this amount million is restricted and held by the lender 
borrowings under the line of credit accrue interest at the prime rate plus and may  in certain circumstances  be reduced to the prime rate plus 
our obligations under the line of credit are secured by a first priority lien in certain of our accounts receivable and are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries 
the agreements governing the line of credit contain certain customary representations and warranties  covenants  notice provisions and events of default 
amended and restated cisco note in connection with the cisco recapitalization  we amended our credit agreement with cisco capital 
the amended and restated credit agreement became effective at the closing of the recapitalization on july  our remaining million of indebtedness to cisco is evidenced by a promissory note  which we refer to as the amended and restated cisco note 
the amended and restated cisco note eliminated the covenants related to our financial performance 
cisco capital retained its senior security interest in substantially all of our assets  except that we are permitted to subordinate cisco capital s security interest in our accounts receivable 
the cisco recapitalization was considered a troubled debt restructuring under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors of troubled debt restructurings 
under sfas no 
 the amended and restated cisco note was recorded at its principal amount of million plus the estimated future interest payments of million 
convertible subordinated notes 
in connection with the march exchange and settlement related to our convertible subordinated notes  we eliminated of principal and million of accrued interest 
the terms of the remaining million of convertible subordinated notes were not impacted by the exchange and settlement and they continue to be due on june  contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations these amounts include million of operating lease  maintenance and license agreement obligations  reduced by sublease agreements of million 
capital lease obligations 
the capital lease obligations above were incurred in connection with our irus for inter city and intra city dark fiber underlying substantial portions of our network 
these capital leases are presented on our balance sheet at the net present value of the future minimum lease payments  or million at december  these leases generally have terms of to years 
letters of credit 
we are also party to letters of credit totaling million at december  these obligations are fully secured by our restricted investments  and as a result  are excluded from the contractual cash obligations above 
future capital requirements we believe that our cash on hand which includes cash obtained in from our line of credit  subordinated note and building sale  together with cash flows from operations  will be adequate to meet our working capital  capital expenditure  debt service and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future if we execute our business plan 
our business plan assumes  among other things  the following our ability to maintain or increase the size of our current customer base  and our ability to achieve expected cost savings as a result of the integration of our recent acquisitions into our business 
additionally  any future acquisitions or other significant unplanned costs or cash requirements may require that we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity 
we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or our stockholders  or at all 
insufficient funds may require us to delay or scale back the number of buildings that we serve or require us to otherwise alter our business plan or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
we may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the remaining million face value of allied riser notes with cash  stock or assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions  either directly or through intermediaries where we believe that market conditions are favorable to do so 
such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
public offering on february   we filed a registration statement on a form s with the securities and exchange commission relating to the sale of up to million of our common stock in our public offering 
there can be no assurances that the offering will be completed 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  revenue allowances  long lived assets  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition and that require complex  significant and subjective management judgments are discussed below 
we have not experienced significant revisions to our assumptions except to the extent that they result from variations in the trading price of our common stock which has caused us to revise the assumptions that we use in determining deferred compensation  changes in the amount and aging of our accounts receivable which have caused us to revise the assumptions that we use in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  changes in interest rates which have caused us to revise the assumptions that we use in determining the present value of future minimum lease payments and changes in estimated sub lease income which has caused us to revise our restructuring accrual 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenue when the services are performed  evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
service discounts and incentives offered to certain customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue when granted or ratably over the estimated customer life 
fees billed in connection with customer installations and other upfront charges are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated customer life 
we determine the estimated customer life using a historical analysis of customer retention 
if our estimated customer life increases  we will recognize installation revenue over a longer period 
we expense direct costs associated with sales as incurred 
allowances for sales credits and unfulfilled purchase obligations we have established allowances to account for sales credit adjustments and unfulfilled contractual purchase obligations 
our allowance for sales credit adjustments is designed to account for reductions to our service revenue that occur when customers are granted a termination of service adjustment for amounts billed in advance or a service level agreement credit or discount 
this allowance is provided for by reducing our gross service revenue and is determined by actual credits granted during the period and an estimate of unprocessed credits 
at any point in time this allowance is determined by the amount and nature of credits granted prior to the balance sheet date 
our allowance for unfulfilled contractual purchase obligations is designed to account for non payment of amounts under agreements that we have with certain of our customers that place minimum purchase obligations on them 
although we vigorously seek payments due pursuant to these purchase obligations  we have historically collected only approximately of these payments 
in order to allow for this we reduce our gross service revenue by the amount that has been invoiced to these customers 
we reduce this allowance and recognize the related service revenue only upon the receipt of cash payments in respect of these invoices 
at any point in time this allowance is determined by the amount of unfulfilled contractual purchase obligations invoiced to our customers and with respect to which we are continuing to seek payment 
once we submit these accounts receivable to a third party collection agency  this allowance is reduced 
valuation allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and deferred tax assets we have established allowances that we use in connection with valuing expense charges associated with uncollectible accounts receivable and our deferred tax assets 
our valuation allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is designed to account for the expense associated with writing off accounts receivable that we estimate will not be collected 
we provide for this by increasing our selling  general and administrative expenses by the amount of receivables that we estimate will not be collected 
we assess the adequacy of this allowance monthly by evaluating general factors  such as the length of time individual receivables are past due  historical collection experience  the economic and competitive environment  and changes in the credit worthiness of our customers 
we also assess the ability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to us and establish specific allowances based on the amount we expect to collect from these customers 
as of december   and  respectively  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable comprised   and of our total accounts receivable 
for the years ended december   and  our allowance for doubtful accounts expense accounted for  and of our total sg a expenses  respectively 
our valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset is designed to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net operating losses and our other deferred tax assets in the event that we record positive income for income tax purposes 
for federal and state tax purposes  our net operating loss carry forwards  including those that we have generated through our operations and those acquired in the allied riser merger could be subject to significant limitations on annual use 
to account for this uncertainty we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset 
as a result the value of our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is zero 
impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  and intangible assets with definite useful lives to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed pursuant to the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to our best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition over the remaining useful life of the primary asset in the asset group 
as of december  and december   we tested our long lived assets for impairment 
in the event that there are changes in the planned use of our long lived assets  or our expected future undiscounted cash flows are reduced significantly  our assessment of our ability to recover the carrying value of these assets under sfas no 
could change 
because our best estimate of undiscounted cash flows generated from these assets exceeds their carrying value for each of the periods presented  no impairment pursuant to sfas no 
exists 
however  because of the significant difficulties confronting the telecommunications industry  we believe that currently the fair value of our long lived assets including our network assets and irus are significantly below the amounts we originally paid for them and may be less than their current depreciated cost basis 
our best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows is sensitive to changes in our estimated cash flows and any change in the lease period or in the designation of our primary asset in the asset group 
business combinations we account for our business combinations pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations 
under sfas no 
we allocate the cost of an acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
intangible assets are recognized when they arise from contractual or other legal rights or if they are separable as defined by sfas no 
we determine estimated fair values using quoted market prices  when available  present values determined at appropriate current interest rates  or multiples of monthly revenue for certain customer contracts 
consideration not in the form of cash is measured based upon the fair value of the consideration given 
goodwill and other intangibles we account for our intangible assets pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
we determine the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected use of the intangible asset  contractual provisions  obsolescence and other factors 
we amortized our intangible assets on a straight line basis 
we presently have no intangible assets that are not subject to amortization 
other accounting policies we record assets and liabilities under capital leases at the lesser of the present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets under lease 
we capitalize the direct costs incurred prior to an asset being ready for service as construction in progress 
construction in progress includes costs incurred under the construction contract  interest  and the salaries and benefits of employees directly involved with construction activities 
our capitalization of these costs is sensitive to the percentage of time and number of our employees involved in construction activities 
we estimate the fair market value of our series h preferred stock based upon the number of common shares the series h preferred stock converts into and the trading price of our common stock on the grant date 
the fair market value of our series h preferred stock is sensitive to changes in the trading price of our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb ratified the consensuses reached by emerging issues task force in issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
eitf 
eitf clarifies the definitional issues surrounding participating securities and requires companies to restate prior earnings per share amounts for comparative purposes upon adoption 
we adopted the provisions of eitf in the second quarter of  and restated our previously disclosed basic earnings per share amounts to include our participating securities in basic earnings per share when including such shares would have a dilutive effect 
as a result of the adoption and for comparative purposes  basic income per share available to common shareholders decreased from to for the quarter ended march   from to for the quarter ended september   and from to for the year ended december  in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based upon their fair values 
we currently disclose the impact of valuing grants of stock options and recording the related compensation expense in a pro forma footnote to our financial statements 
under sfas r this alternative is no longer available 
we will be required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of and as a result will record additional compensation expense in our statements of operations 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss income in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas r on our financial position and results of operations  including the valuation methods and support for the assumptions that underlie the valuation of the awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
our primary market risk exposure is related to our marketable securities and currency fluctuations of the euro and the canadian dollar versus the united states dollar 
we place our marketable securities investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
marketable securities were approximately million at december   million of which are considered cash equivalents and mature in days or less and million are short term investments  million of which are restricted for collateral against letters of credit 
we also own commercial paper investments and certificates of deposit totaling million that are classified as other long term assets 
these investments are also restricted for collateral against letters of credit 
our debt obligations at december  carry fixed interest rates and are not subject to changes in interest rates 
our million line of credit which we entered into in march is indexed to the prime rate plus and may  in certain circumstances be reduced to the prime rate plus 
interest on our amended and restated cisco note will not accrue until february  unless we default under the terms of the note 
when the note accrues interest  interest accrues at the day libor rate plus 
based upon the borrowing rates for debt arrangements with similar terms we estimate the fair value of our allied riser convertible subordinated notes at million and the fair value of our amended and restated cisco note at million 
if interest rates were to increase by we estimate that these fair values would be million and million  respectively 
our european operations expose us to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risk 
for example  while we record revenues and financial results from our european operations in euros  these results are reflected in our consolidated financial statements in us dollars 
therefore  our reported results are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
in particular  we fund the euro based operating expenses and associated cash flow requirements of our european operations  including iru obligations  in us dollars 
accordingly  in the event that the euro strengthens versus the dollar to a greater extent  the expenses and cash flow requirements associated with our european operations may be significantly higher in us dollar terms than planned
