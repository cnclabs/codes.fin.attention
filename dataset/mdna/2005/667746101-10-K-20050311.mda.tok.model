overview our water transmission products are manufactured in our portland  oregon  denver  colorado  adelanto and riverside  california  parkersburg  west virginia  and saginaw  texas facilities 
tubular products are manufactured in our portland  oregon  atchison  kansas  houston  texas  bossier city  louisiana  and monterrey  mexico facilities 
we believe that the tubular products business  in conjunction with the water transmission business  provide a significant degree of market diversification  because the principal factors affecting demand for water transmission products are different from those affecting demand for tubular products 
demand for water transmission products is generally based on population growth and movement  changing water sources and replacement of aging infrastructure 
demand can vary dramatically within our market area since each population center determines its own waterworks requirements 
demand for tubular products is influenced by construction activity and general economic conditions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from construction contracts in our water transmission segment is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs of each contract 
estimated total costs of each contract are reviewed on a monthly basis by project management and operations personnel for all projects that are fifty percent or more complete except that major projects  usually over million  are reviewed earlier if sufficient production has been completed to provide enough information to revise the original estimated total cost of the project 
all cost revisions that result in the gross profit as a percent of sales increasing or decreasing by greater than one percent are reviewed by senior management personnel 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period such losses are known 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
historically  actual results have been within management s estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue from our tubular products segment is recognized when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and from contract disputes 
the extension and revision of credit is established by obtaining credit rating reports or financial information of a potential customer 
trade receivable balances are evaluated at least monthly 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us as a result of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s financial position  contract dispute  product claim or other similar events  a specific allowance is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the expected recovery amount given all information presently available 
a general allowance is recorded for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
as of december   the accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million 
we believe the reported allowances at december   are adequate 
if the customers financial conditions were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may need to be recorded  which would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
historically  actual results have been within management s estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors 
long lived assets property and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets 
we assess impairment of property and equipment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with all acquisitions 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
as required under sfas  we performed our annual assessment for impairment of the goodwill as of december   based on our analysis  we believe no impairment of goodwill exists 
if we determine that the carrying value of the property and equipment or goodwill will not be recoverable  we calculate and record impairment losses using future undiscounted cash flows 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about the expected future operating performance of the company 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  or changes to our business operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
finished goods are stated at standard cost  which approximates the first in  first out method of accounting 
raw material inventories of steel coil are stated at cost on a specific identification basis or at standard cost 
raw material inventories of coating and lining materials  as well as materials and supplies  are stated on an average cost basis 
income taxes we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
self insurance we are self insured for health claims for certain employees 
in addition  we are self insured for a portion of losses and liabilities associated with workers compensation claims 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and  for workers compensation  certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
the company has purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit  to the extent feasible  the aggregate exposure to claims 
there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the company against liability from all potential consequences 
pension benefits we have two defined benefit pension plans that are frozen 
we fund these plans to cover current plan costs plus amortization of the unfunded plan liabilities 
to record these obligations  management uses estimates relating to assumed inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  and discount rates 
management  along with third party actuaries  reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial information regarding costs and expenses expressed as a percentage of total net sales and net sales of our business segments 
year ended december  net sales water transmission tubular products total net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales water transmission tubular products year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in or water transmission sales increased to million in from million in net sales increased over the same period last year as a result of increased volume  which is attributable to stronger demand 
our water transmission business is impacted by infrastructure improvements  as municipal water agencies initiate improvements  we generally experience an increase in demand for our products 
in addition to increased sales  the stronger demand resulted in an improved backlog at december  of  as compared to the backlog of million at the beginning of bidding activity  backlog and sales resulting from the award of new projects  or the production of current projects  may vary significantly from period to period 
tubular products sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales over the same period last year resulted primarily from our ability to pass on steel price increases to our customers 
during  we raised prices on our tubular products in order to pass along to our customers the steel surcharges and base price increases our steel vendors have included on steel purchased by us 
these price increases are designed to absorb the increase in the cost of steel  our principal raw material 
the timing and the extent to which our future prices may be adjusted because of fluctuations in the steel marketplace are uncertain  therefore  no assurance can be given that we will succeed in maintaining similar growth in gross profit 
gross profit increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit increased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in our water transmission projects are obtained primarily through competitive bidding  which often occurs three to six months in advance of production of the projects 
at the time of the bidding  we attempt to accurately estimate the future price of steel that will be purchased for the project and include that in our bid 
our water transmission gross margin percentage decreased from the same period last year primarily because we experienced significant increases in the price per ton and the surcharges on steel  which comprises the majority of our cost of goods sold 
as this significant component of our cost of sales increases  our gross margin percentage is necessarily driven down  even if all steel cost increases are passed along to our customers 
to some extent  our water transmission gross profit also decreased because we did not fully anticipate nor include in our project bidding the full amount of the increase in the cost of steel early in the year 
gross profit  however  as a percent of segment net sales is expected to improve in the first part of as our production continues to be strong and we are able to take advantage of higher plant utilization  which will drive down our remaining costs of goods sold 
gross profit from tubular products increased significantly to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in tubular products gross profit increased over the same period last year primarily as a result of the elimination of sales of low margin products and the sale of generally lower costing inventory at higher selling prices charged by the company in response to increasing steel costs 
as steel price increases begin to moderate  our margins should stabilize in the low double digit range 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in incentive compensation and professional fees incurred to meet sarbanes oxley compliance requirements 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in both our outstanding borrowings and the rates on those borrowings 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in and in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in or water transmission sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily a result of lower production levels that resulted from the combination of a low backlog at the beginning of the year  limited bidding activity through the majority of the first half of the year  and delays in obtaining approval from customers to produce projects in our backlog 
tubular products sales increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of improvements in the energy market 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit decreased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in water transmission gross profit decreased as a result of lower volume 
increased competition lowered the overall margins on jobs booked in and the low production utilization resulted in higher production costs in the first half of even though overall bidding activity improved in the second half of the year and our bookings increased  the continued unevenness of the bidding activity in the second half of resulted in less than optimal utilization of plant capacity 
gross profit from tubular products decreased significantly to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in tubular products gross profit decreased in as a result of the inability to fully pass on steel price increases to our customers during the year 
import pricing pressures and relatively low demand in our key markets kept prices of our products at lower levels than we had historically seen in relation to steel costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in the decrease was primarily the result of reduction in wages 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense resulted from a lower aggregate interest rate 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in and in liquidity and capital resources we generally finance our operations through cash flows from operations and available borrowings 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and available borrowings of million 
net cash used in operating activities in was million 
this was primarily the result of an increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  inventories  and trade and other receivables  net of  and million  respectively  offset in part by our net income of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  and non cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million 
the increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  inventories and trade receivables resulted primarily from the increased production in the water transmission segment of our business and the high cost of steel 
the increase in accounts payable can also be attributed to the increased production  which required additional receipts of steel and other raw materials 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  which primarily related to additions of property and equipment 
capital expenditures are expected to be between and million in net cash provided by financing activities in was million  which primarily resulted from net new borrowings under our long term debt agreement 
we had the following significant components of debt at december  a million credit agreement  under which million was outstanding  million of series a senior notes  million of series b senior notes  million of senior notes  million of series a term note  million of series b term notes  million of series c term notes  an industrial development bond of million  and capital lease obligations of  the credit agreement expires on december  the balance outstanding under the credit agreement bears interest at rates related to libor plus to at december   or at prime minus to prime plus at december  
we had million outstanding under the line of credit  with million bearing interest at and million bearing interest at  partially offset by million in cash receipts that had not been applied to the loan balance 
at december  we had an additional net borrowing capacity under the line of credit of million 
the series a term note in the principal amount of million matures on february  and requires annual payments in the amount of million that begin february  plus interest of paid quarterly on february  may  august and november the series b term notes in the principal amount of million mature on june  and require annual payments in the amount of million that begin june  plus interest of paid quarterly on march  june  september and december the series c term notes in the principal amount of million mature on october  and require annual payments of million that begin october  plus interest of paid quarterly on january  april  july and october the series a senior notes in the principal amount of million mature on april  and require annual payments in the amount of million that began april  plus interest at paid quarterly on january  april  july and october the series b senior notes in the principal amount of million mature on april  and require annual payments of million that began april  plus interest at paid quarterly on january  april  july and october the senior notes in the principal amount of million mature on november  and require annual payments in the amount of million that began november  plus interest of paid quarterly on february  may  august  and november the senior notes  series a senior notes and series b senior notes together  the notes also include supplemental interest from to at december   based on our total minimum net earnings before tax plus interest expense net of capitalized interest expense  depreciation expense and amortization expense ebitda to total debt leverage ratio  which is paid with the required quarterly interest payments 
the notes  the series a term note  the series b term notes  and series c term notes together  the term notes and the credit agreement are collateralized by all accounts receivable  inventory and certain equipment 
the industrial development bond matures on april  and requires annual principal payments of  and monthly interest payments 
the interest rate on the industrial development bond is variable 
it was as of december  as compared to on december  the bond is collateralized by property and equipment and guaranteed by an irrevocable letter of credit 
we lease certain hardware and software related to a company wide enterprise resource planning system and other equipment 
the aggregated interest rate on the capital leases is 
we have operating leases with respect to certain manufacturing equipment that require us to pay property taxes  insurance and maintenance 
under the terms of certain operating leases  we sold equipment to an unrelated third party the lessor who then leased the equipment to us 
these leases  along with other debt instruments already in place  and our credit agreement  best met our near term financing and operating capital requirements compared to other available options at the time they were entered into 
certain of our operating lease agreements include renewals and or purchase options set to expire at various dates 
in addition  certain of our operating lease agreements  primarily manufacturing equipment leases  with terms of years  contain provisions related to residual value guarantees  which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value 
the maximum potential liability to us under such guarantees is million at december  if the proceeds from the sale of terminating equipment leases are zero 
consistent with past experience  management does not expect any significant payments will be required pursuant to these guarantees  and no amounts have been accrued at december  the following table sets forth our commitments under the terms of our debt obligations and operating leases total thereafter credit agreement the notes the term notes industrial development bond capital leases operating leases total obligations although the credit agreement expires on december   we have included the amount as current due to the subjective acceleration clause included in the agreement 
we also have entered into stand by letters of credit that total approximately million as of december  the stand by letters of credit relate to workers compensation  general liability insurance  and our industrial revenue bond 
due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience  we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements 
therefore  they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above 
the credit agreement  the notes  the term notes and operating leases all require compliance with the following financial covenants minimum consolidated tangible net worth  maximum consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda  minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage test and a limitation on credit agreement borrowings based on a borrowing base formula that includes a certain portion of our accounts receivable  inventory and property and equipment 
these and other covenants included in our financing agreements impose certain requirements with respect to our financial condition and results of operations  and place restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness  to create liens or other encumbrances on assets and capital expenditures 
a failure by us to comply with the requirements of these covenants  if not waived or cured  could permit acceleration of the related indebtedness and acceleration of indebtedness under other instruments that include cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
at december   we were not in violation of any of the covenants in our debt agreements 
we expect to continue to rely on cash generated from operations and other sources of available funds to make required principal payments under the notes during we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flows expected to be generated by operations and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent necessary  we may also satisfy capital requirements through additional bank borrowings  senior notes  term notes and capital and operating leases  if such resources are available on satisfactory terms 
we have from time to time evaluated and continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions and expansion 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our working capital or necessitate additional bank borrowings 
related party transactions 
we have ongoing business relationships with certain affiliates of wells fargo company wells fargo 
wells fargo  together with certain of its affiliates  is our largest shareholder 
during the year ended december   we made the following payments to affiliates of wells fargo i capital and operating lease payments pursuant to which the company leases certain equipment from such affiliates  ii payments of interest and fees pursuant to letters of credit originated by such affiliates  iii payments of principal and interest on an industrial development bond  and iv payments of principal  interest and related fees in connection with loan agreements between the company and such affiliates 
payments made by us to wells fargo and its affiliates amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
balances due to wells fargo and its affiliates were million and million at december  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our results of operations or financial position  but do not expect sfas to have a material effect 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph l b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas no 
r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
the provisions of this statement are effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas no 
r commencing with the quarter ending september  we estimate the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r will approximate the impact of the adjustments made to determine pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share under statement no 
 as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
risk factors following are the key risk factors that have affected our net sales and net income in the past and could materially impact our future net sales and net income any decline in demand for public water transmission projects could adversely affect our business 
our water transmission business accounted for approximately of our net sales in our water transmission revenue is derived from sales related to public water transmission projects 
as a result  our sales could be adversely impacted by a change in the number of projects planned by public water agencies or by delays in obtaining environmental approvals and right of way permits 
additionally  adjustments in governmental capital spending  budgetary constraints related to capital projects  or the inability of governmental entities to issue debt to finance projects could adversely affect our water transmission sales 
project delays in public water transmission projects could adversely affect our business 
the public water agencies constructing water transmission projects generally announce the projects well in advance of the bidding and construction process 
it is not unusual for projects to be delayed and rescheduled 
projects are delayed and rescheduled for a number of reasons  including changes in project priorities  difficulties in complying with environmental and other government regulations and additional time required to acquire rights of way or property rights 
delays in public water transmission projects may occur with too little notice to allow us to replace those projects in our manufacturing schedules 
as a result  our business may be adversely affected by unplanned downtime 
we have a significant amount of outstanding debt 
we have financed our operations through cash flow from operations  available borrowings and other financing arrangements 
the debt we have incurred could adversely affect us because our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes in the future may be limited  a portion of our cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit agreement is dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt  which reduces funds available for operations  and certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which cause us to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt will depend on our future operating performance and cash flow  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions  prevailing interest rate levels and other financial  competitive and business factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our outstanding debt includes financial covenants that impose certain requirements with respect to our financial condition and results of operations 
these covenants place restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness and to create liens or other encumbrances on assets 
a failure to comply with the requirements of these covenants  if not waived or cured  could permit acceleration of the related indebtedness and acceleration of indebtedness under other instruments that include cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
we may be subject to claims for damages for defective products  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we warrant our products to be free of certain defects 
losses may result or be alleged to result from defects in our products  which could subject us to claims for damages  including consequential damages 
any claims relating to defective products that result in liability exceeding our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in steel prices may affect our future operating results 
purchased steel represents a substantial portion of our cost of sales  particularly in our tubular products business 
the steel industry is highly cyclical in nature  and  at times  pricing can be highly volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  import duties  other trade restrictions and currency exchange rates 
this volatility can significantly affect our gross profit 
although we seek to recover increases in steel prices through price increases in our products  we have not always been completely successful 
any increase in steel prices that is not offset by increases in our prices could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our gross margins and net income 
we face significant competition 
orders in the water transmission business are competitively bid  and price competition can be vigorous 
there are many competitors in the tubular products business  and price is often a prime consideration for purchase of our products 
price competition may reduce our gross margins  which may adversely affect our net income 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
our business could also be impeded if existing competitors expand  or if they or new competitors establish new facilities within our market areas 
our tubular products business faces intense competition from imports 
the level of imports of tubular products affects the domestic tubular products market 
high levels of imports may reduce the volume of tubular products sold by domestic producers and depress selling prices of tubular products 
we believe that import levels are affected by  among other things  overall worldwide demand for tubular products  the trade practices of foreign governments  government subsidies to foreign producers and governmentally imposed trade restrictions in the united states 
increased imports of tubular products in the united states  canada  and mexico could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our water transmission business faces competition from concrete and ductile iron pipe manufacturers 
water transmission pipe is manufactured generally from steel  concrete or ductile iron 
each pipe material has advantages and disadvantages 
steel and concrete are more common materials for larger diameter water transmission pipelines because ductile iron pipe generally is limited in diameter due to its manufacturing process 
the public agencies and engineers who determine the specifications for water transmission projects analyze these pipe materials for suitability for each project 
individual project circumstances normally dictate the preferred material 
if we experience cost increases in raw material  labor and overhead specific to our industry or the location of our facilities  while competing products or companies do not experience similar changes  we could experience a change in the demand  price and profitability of our products 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation 
our net sales and net income may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the schedule of production of water transmission orders  the seasonal variation in demand for tubular products  fluctuations in the cost of steel and other raw materials  and competitive pressures 
results of operations in any period are not indicative of results for any future period  and comparisons between any two periods may not be meaningful 
we depend on our senior management team  and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations 
our success depends on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team 
the loss of any of these individuals  particularly brian w 
dunham  our president and chief executive officer  or our inability to attract  retain and maintain additional personnel  could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed 
we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel 
the success of our business is affected by general economic conditions  and our business may be adversely affected by economic slowdown or recession 
periods of economic slowdown or recession in the united states  or the public perception that one may occur  could decrease the demand for our products  affect the price of our products and adversely impact our business 
we have been impacted by the general slowing of the economy and any worsening of the economic slowdown could have further negative impacts on our business 
our stock s relatively low trading volume may limit your ability to sell your shares 
although our shares of common stock are listed on the nasdaq national market  our average daily trading volume over the twelve months ended december  is approximately  shares 
as a result  holders of our shares may have difficulty selling a large number of shares of our common stock in the manner or at a price that might otherwise be attainable if our shares were more actively traded 
the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are our operating and financial performance and prospects  quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators  such as earnings per share  net income and revenues  changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  loss of any member of our senior management team  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructuring  sales of our common stock by shareholders  general market conditions  and domestic and international economic  legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock markets in general have experienced broad fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we are subject to various environmental laws  which may require us to incur substantial costs  thereby reducing our profits 
failure to comply with environmental laws  regulations and permits  or changes in such laws  including the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment  could result in substantial operating costs and capital expenditures in order to maintain compliance and could also include fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party claims for property damage or personal injury  cleanup costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations 
certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years and  over time  we and other predecessor operators of these facilities may have generated  used  handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes 
environmental liabilities could exist  including cleanup obligations at these or at other locations where materials from our operations were disposed of  which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits 
we have been notified by the environmental protection agency that we may be subject to potential liability in connection with a superfund assessment site in portland  oregon 
we cannot predict if it will be determined that we have liability with respect to this site  but any such determination could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain provisions of our governing documents and oregon law could discourage potential acquisition proposals 
our articles of incorporation contain provisions that classify the board of directors into three classes  each of which serves for a three year term with one class elected each year  provide that directors may be removed by shareholders only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of of the outstanding shares of common stock  and permit the board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the number of shares constituting any such series  the voting powers and all other rights and preferences of any such series  without any further vote or action by our shareholders 
in addition  we are subject to the oregon business combination act  which imposes certain restrictions on business combination transactions and may encourage parties interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors 
we also have a shareholder rights plan that acts to discourage any person or group from making a tender offer for  or acquiring  more than of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors 
any of these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals  could deter  delay or prevent a change in control that our shareholders consider favorable and could depress the market value of our common stock 
we face risks in connection with potential acquisitions 
acquiring businesses that complement or expand our operations has been an important element of our business strategy in the past 
although we have not completed an acquisition since  we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that may expand and complement our business 
we may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate favorable terms in the future 
furthermore  our ability to effectively integrate any future acquisitions will depend on  among other things  the adequacy of our implementation plans  the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operational efficiencies
