overview we are a leading provider of entertainment technology  historically focused on high quality digital multi channel audio technology  products  and services for entertainment markets worldwide 
multi channel audio  commonly referred to as surround sound  provides more than two channels of audio  allowing the listener to simultaneously hear discrete sounds from multiple speakers 
our dts digital multi channel audio technology delivers compelling surround sound for the motion picture and consumer electronics markets 
we manage our business through two reportable segments our consumer business and our cinema business  which we have previously described as our theatrical business 
historically  we have derived a majority of our revenues from the cinema business 
beginning in  however  we have derived a majority of our revenues from our consumer business 
in connection with our acquisition of lowry digital images  inc  or ldi  we will have a third reportable segment in the first quarter of in our consumer business  we derive revenues from licensing our audio technology  trademarks  and know how under agreements with substantially all of the major consumer audio electronics manufacturers 
our business model provides for these manufacturers to pay us a per unit amount for dts enabled products that they manufacture 
we also derive revenues from licensing our technology to consumer semiconductor manufacturers 
through our dts entertainment label  we derive revenues from the sale of multi channel music titles in our digital multi channel format 
in our cinema business  we derive revenues from sales of our playback equipment and cinema processors to movie theaters and special venues 
in addition  we license technology and sell encoding and duplication services to film producers and distributors for the creation of digital multi channel motion picture soundtracks 
we also derive revenues from the sale of systems and encoding services for pre show advertising  alternative content  subtitling  captioning  and descriptive narration 
we present revenues in our consolidated financial statements and in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as derived from technology and film licensing and product sales and other revenues 
our technology and film licensing revenues are derived from each of our consumer and cinema business segments 
revenues from technology licensing in connection with our consumer business segment include revenues derived from licensing our audio technology  trademarks  and know how to consumer electronics  personal computer  video game and console  digital satellite and cable broadcast  and professional audio companies as well as to semiconductor manufacturers 
revenues from technology and film licensing in connection with our cinema business segment include revenues derived from film licensing and services that we provide to film studios for the production of soundtracks in our digital multi channel format 
our product sales and other revenues also are derived from each of our consumer and cinema business segments 
revenues from product sales and other revenues in connection with our consumer business segment include revenues derived from sales of music titles that we produce in our digital multi channel format and sales of our professional audio products and services 
revenues from product sales and other revenues in connection with our cinema business segment include revenues derived from sales of our digital playback systems  cinema processor equipment  and systems for subtitling  captioning  and descriptive narration to movie theaters and special venues 
we actively engage in intellectual property compliance and enforcement activities focused on identifying third parties who have either incorporated our technology  trademarks  or know how without a license or who have under reported to us the amount of royalties owed under license agreements with us 
we continue to invest in our compliance and enforcement infrastructure to support the value of our intellectual property to us and our licensees and to improve the long term realization of our intellectual property 
as a result of these activities  from time to time  we recognize royalty revenues that relate to consumer electronics manufacturing activities from prior periods 
these royalty recoveries may cause revenues to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and may not occur in subsequent periods 
we cannot predict the amount or timing of such revenues 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid for products and materials  salaries and related benefits for production personnel  depreciation of production equipment  and payments to third parties for licensing technology and copyrighted material 
our selling  general  and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  and related benefits for personnel engaged in sales  corporate administration  finance  human resources  information systems  legal  and operations  and costs associated with promotional and other selling activities 
selling  general  and administrative expenses also include professional fees  facility related expenses  and other general corporate expenses 
our research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and related benefits for research and development personnel  engineering consulting expenses associated with new product and technology development  and quality assurance and testing costs 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in our consumer business  we have a licensing team that markets our technology directly to large consumer electronics products manufacturers and semiconductor manufacturers 
this team includes employees located in the united states  china  england  japan  and northern ireland 
we sell music content released under our dts entertainment label through distributors 
in the united states and canada  navarre corporation is our exclusive distributor of dts entertainment label products to major national retail accounts and in europe  cadiz music limited is our exclusive distributor of dts entertainment label products 
disc union serves as our exclusive distributor in japan 
we also employ consultants to coordinate sales to independent retailers 
we are in the process of establishing distribution channels in other international territories 
we intend to engage one or more additional distributors with an established presence in asia to handle distribution other asian territories 
we also sell this music directly to consumers through an online store and other web based retailers 
we intend to expand the number of retail outlets that carry our products and broaden our distribution network worldwide 
in our cinema business  our post production department  senior management  and liaison offices market our products and services directly to individual film producers and distributors worldwide 
we sell our digital multi channel playback systems to movie theaters through a direct sales force and a network of independent dealers 
to date  most of our sales and marketing efforts have been focused in the united states and canada  western europe  and in targeted markets in asia and latin america 
we have also begun to focus our efforts on pursuing theater companies that have a large concentration of movie theaters in selected foreign countries such as india and china  and in eastern europe 
with our recent acquisition of ldi  we now provide restoration and enhancement services for moving pictures captured on film or in digital form 
these services enable current or archived content to be restored for high quality  high definition presentations in digital cinema  high definition optical media or broadcast applications 
management discussion regarding trends  opportunities  and challenges consumer segment revenue from our consumer segment constitutes the majority of our total revenue  representing   and of total revenues in fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
our consumer revenue is primarily dependent upon the home theater and dvd player markets  which have experienced rapid growth over the past several years 
the success of dvd video based systems and products has fueled a demand for ever higher quality entertainment in the home  and this demand is extending to the car and pc markets as well 
we expect the recent acceleration of the market for high definition televisions to drive demand for high definition optical disc players beginning in late because we expect to be a mandatory technology for the next generation players  our consumer revenue growth should more closely track the growth rate of these players over the next several years 
we expect that the market for high definition players will yield new growth that provides an offset to the expected decline in the overall growth in dvd player shipments 
further  we believe that expected mandatory inclusion in next generation optical disc standards will help to improve the adoption rate of our technologies in other consumer products such as next generation video game consoles  personal audio and video players  personal computers and in car entertainment systems 
failure to attain mandatory status in next generation high definition optical disc standards could cause revenue growth in our consumer business to be significantly lower than expected and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in july  we acquired qdesign corporation  or qdesign  a company focused on lower bit rate audio delivery technology 
the market for higher quality entertainment is expanding into portable devices that require the use of low bit rate audio coding systems including portable audio players  pdas and wireless handset applications 
concurrent with this trend  there is a growing need for a good link between home and portable devices that preserves as much quality as possible and allows consumers a seamless technology solution for the storage and playback of their content 
in october  leveraging our existing research and development efforts and the intellectual property acquired in the qdesign acquisition  we launched dts hd  a scalable coding system 
this technology allows content to be played in home and portable devices 
we believe that the broad and robust nature of this offering improves the probability of inclusion of our technologies in next generation products 
cinema segment revenue from our cinema segment represented   and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in our cinema business  was a solid year for sales of our playback hardware  marking a return to growth for cinema product sales 
we expect growth in our cinema audio hardware to continue at a modest pace in we also believe that the cinema exhibition community has recognized that pre show entertainment represents a significant revenue growth opportunity that will lead to investment in pre show solutions over the next several years 
because our xd cinema media player can be configured to perform audio playback along with pre show or subtitling presentation  we believe that we are well positioned to participate in the growth in this market 
in january we acquired lowry digital images  inc  or ldi  a company focused in high quality image restoration and enhancement 
we believe that the growing market for televisions capable of playing high resolution or high definition content will create a substantial demand for such content 
we believe that ldi has a technological advantage over many of its competitors based on the sophistication of its processes and level of automation used to restore or enhance the image quality of entertainment content 
to date  ldi has restored and or enhanced over feature films  including such recent major dvd releases as star wars and indiana jones 
major motion picture and television studios possess libraries containing thousands of titles  which we believe represents a sizable market opportunity for ldi s service 
another trend that we believe will affect our cinema business segment is the the long term trend toward digital media 
we believe this trend will involve the near term adoption of digital pre show and or electronic cinema solutions  followed by longer term adoption of higher quality digital cinema 
digital media offers the motion picture industry a means to achieve substantial cost savings  including the printing and distribution of movies  help in combating piracy  and will enable movies to be played repeatedly without degradation 
it also provides additional revenue opportunities for cinema operators  as digital content such as advertisements  concerts and sporting events could be shown in or broadcast to digitally equipped theaters 
we believe the widespread adoption of digital cinema will be longer term because of the significant capital investment that will be required by cinema operators to purchase new equipment and solutions 
we believe this represents an opportunity for us as we seek to provide products and services in support of the transition from film based content towards digital cinema 
however  we do not currently offer digital cinema products and may not be succesful in developing or selling competitive product offerings 
we believe that our recent acquisition of ldi  coupled with the pre show and alternative content capabilities of our xd cinema media player  will enable us to play a role in the industry transition to high definition sound and images for digital cinema 
sales of cinema products and film licensing tend to fluctuate based on the underlying trends in the motion picture industry 
for instance  in the late s various cinema operators aggressively built megaplexes  which resulted in an oversupply of screens in some domestic and international markets 
the resulting oversupply of screens led to significant declines in revenues per screen  and eventually  many theaters were closed 
as the theater industry has regained health in the last several years  sales of our dts playback systems and cinema processors have improved 
our film licensing revenues are also subject to fluctuations based on industry trends  most significantly  the number of films being made by studios and independent filmmakers 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  estimates are evaluated  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  product warranty  taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the guidelines of the sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
as amended by sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenues from the sale of cinema hardware products are recorded upon shipment  assuming title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  we have no significant obligations remaining  prices are fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the licensing  encoding and duplication of motion picture soundtracks for use in our playback systems is undertaken under arrangements with major film studios 
revenues arising from the licensing and duplication of soundtracks are recognized upon completion  assuming prices are fixed or determinable  we have no significant obligations remaining  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
direct costs associated with deferred revenue are deferred and included in other assets 
included in the balance sheet are  and  of deferred revenue and costs  respectively  at december  revenues from licensing audio technology  trademarks  and know how are generated from licensing agreements with consumer electronics products manufacturers that generally pay a per unit license fee for products manufactured under those license agreements 
licensees generally report manufacturing information within to days after the end of the quarter in which such activity takes place 
consequently  we recognize revenue from these licensing agreements on a three month lag basis  generally in the quarter following the quarter of manufacture  provided amounts are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
use of this lag method allows for the receipt of licensee royalty reports prior to the recognition of revenue 
revenues from the sale of digital multi channel audio and video content are recorded upon shipment to retail accounts or end customers  assuming title and risk of loss has transferred  prices are fixed or determinable  we have no significant obligations remaining  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
we provide for returns on product sales based on historical experience and adjust such reserves as considered necessary 
to date  there have been no significant sales returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in determining the reserve  we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a variety of factors 
in cases where we become aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on its historical write off experience in conjunction with the length of time the receivables are past due  customer creditworthiness  geographic risk and the current business environment 
our allowances for doubtful accounts at december  and amounted to  and  respectively 
inventories 
inventory levels are based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can result in excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  inventories are reviewed and written down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the costs of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon forecasts for future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
estimates could be influenced by sudden declines in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements  and technological changes 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a write down of approximately million related to our monochrome projector inventory as a result of our revised outlook based on declines in future demand and technological obsolescence 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  which  among other things  establishes new standards for goodwill acquired in a business combination  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and requires the carrying value of goodwill and certain non amortizing intangibles to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
as required by sfas  we perform an impairment test on recorded goodwill by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of each unit  including goodwill 
we determine fair value of the reporting units principally based upon our management s determination of the value of dts as a whole 
this value is determined by considering a number of factors  including our historical and projected financial results  valuation analyses  risks facing us and the liquidity of our common stock 
if the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units  including goodwill  were to exceed our estimation of the fair value of the reporting units  we would record an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we did not have any goodwill at december  we expect to record goodwill in connection with our acquisition of ldi  which occurred in january we account for intangible assets in accordance with sfas this standard requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value many not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
our intangible assets principally consist of acquired technology  which is being amortized over eight years 
no intangible or long lived assets were impaired as of december  we expect to record intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of ldi 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically assess potential impairments of our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered by us include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows and eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss 
an impairment loss is reflected as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  based on the fair market value if available  or discounted cash flows  if not 
to date  we have not had an impairment of long lived assets 
product warranty 
we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for either a one or three year term after sale and provide for estimated future warranty costs at the time revenues are recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by the length of product warranties  product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
our warranty reserves at december  and amounted to  and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
we account for employee stock option and purchase plans in accordance with the provisions of accounting principals board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and the related interpretations of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
accordingly  compensation expense related to employee stock options is recorded  if on the date of the grant  the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price 
upon adoption of sfas r in the third quarter of  mentioned in recently issued accounting standards included elsewhere in this document  we expect to incur significant charges to the statement of operations 
taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as of december   we believe that all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 
in march  in connection with the us internal revenue service s  or irs  regular examination of our tax return for the year ended december   the irs proposed adjustments related to certain items included in our return 
we do not agree with the proposed adjustments and intend to appeal these adjustments 
if the irs prevails in its position  our federal income tax due for would increase by approximately million  plus interest 
the irs could make similar claims for years subsequent to in future audits 
although the final resolution of the adjustments is uncertain  based on currently available information  we believe that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or overall trends in the results of operations 
there is the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the matter is ultimately resolved  if it is resolved unfavorably  or in the period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
contingencies and litigation 
we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
segment and geographic information our reportable segment and geographic information is as follows in thousands revenues by segment for the years ended december  cinema business consumer business total revenues gross profit by segment for the years ended december  cinema business consumer business total gross profit income loss from operations by segment for the years ended december  cinema business consumer business total income from operations revenues by geographic region for the years ended december  united states international total revenues the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  long lived assets by geographic region in which we hold assets in thousands long lived assets as of december  united states international total long lived assets results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december  revenues technology and film licensing product sales and other revenues total revenues cost of goods sold technology and film licensing product sales and other revenues total cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest income  net other expense  net income from legal settlement income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income comparison of years ended december  and revenues technology and film licensing 
technology and film licensing revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues from technology and film licensing was primarily attributable to continued growth in consumer electronics licensing  driven by an increase in the number of dvd based home entertainment systems that incorporate dts technology  such as audio video receivers  dvd players  and home theater in a box systems 
the increase also related to revenues recognized as a result of intellectual property compliance and enforcement activities 
these activities  which included audits of shipments by certain of our licensees of products containing our technology  trademarks and or know how and legal actions taken against licensees and parties who are not our licensees  resulted in recoveries of royalty payments relating to prior periods 
we expect such royalty recoveries to continue and that this activity will continue to improve revenue realization in our licensing business going forward 
overall  we expect technology licensing revenues to continue to grow in  based primarily on the expected continuation of growth in the home theater and dvd player markets 
in addition  our film licensing revenues increased moderately due to revenues generated from increases in the number of us films released  foreign language dubbed versions of major films  and foreign original version films released with a dts soundtrack 
film licensing is expected to grow modestly again in product sales and other 
product sales and other revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased purchases by theater operators of our cinema processors and playback equipment by theater operators as a result of the film exhibition industry s return to growth as well as solid interest in our xd cinema media player 
the adoption of our newer technologies for pre show  subtitling and multi channel music continues to be slower than expected 
product sales and other revenue is expected to grow at a modest rate  as we expect the market for pre show entertainment to develop at a measured pace in segment sales 
revenues from our consumer business totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was driven by the growth in consumer electronics technology licensing as mentioned above 
cinema revenues were million for the year ended december   up from the same period last year due primarily to growth in the sales of our cinema audio products  driven by the film exhibition industry return to growth  as mentioned above 
gross profit consolidated gross profit decreased to of revenues for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the write down of our monochrome projector inventory of approximately million that was a result of our revised outlook based on declines in future demand and technological obsolescence 
we expect consolidated gross margins in the to range in  as we incorporate the activities of ldi into our consolidated results 
technology and film licensing 
gross profit associated with technology and film licensing revenues increased slightly to from of related revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively and we expect this rate to increase slightly during due to a higher mix of technology licensing relative to film licensing 
product sales and other 
gross profit associated with product sales and other revenues decreased to of related revenues for the year ended december  from in the prior year period due to the write down discussed above and we expect this rate to recover to its historical levels and range from the low to mid thirties in segment gross profit 
gross profit for our consumer business remained consistent between years at and we expect this trend to continue into our cinema business gross profit decreased to of related revenues for the quarter ended december  from in the prior year period primarily due to the write down of the monochrome projector inventory discussed above 
the impact of this write down on gross profit was partially offset by the increase in revenue for our cinema business year over year relative to fixed costs 
we expect the gross profit from the cinema business to recover to its historical levels selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to increases in professional services of million  which includes costs associated with our increased intellectual property compliance and enforcement activities  sarbanes oxley related costs and other costs associated with operating as a public company 
also contributing to the increase is an increase of million in salaries and related costs as we increased headcount to support our growth 
the increase also includes increases in advertising and promotion costs related to new product introductions  and insurance costs 
salaries and related costs include stock based compensation  which decreased to  for the year ended december  from  in the prior year period 
stock based compensation for the prior period primarily consists of a charge related to the issuance of a warrant 
included in professional services for the year ended december  is approximately  in legal costs related to our settlement with mintek that was reached in may costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act were approximately  for the year ended december  we expect sarbanes oxley act costs to decrease in to approximately  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as a whole to support our growth initiatives including acquisitions  international expansion and enforcement activities 
research and development for the year ended december   research and development expenses were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to increased labor costs associated with new product initiatives and the optimization of our coherent acoustics technology for new consumer electronics applications and development of tools associated with next generation optical disc standards 
we expect to continue to increase our investment in applications engineering and research and development activities overall and will accelerate those initiatives in future quarters to support the roll out of next generation optical disc standards and the continued optimization of our coherent acoustics technology 
interest income expense  net interest income  net  for the year ended december  increased significantly over the previous year due to increased investment income relating to proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings in july and november of income from legal settlement in may  we reached a settlement with mintek for million for trademark infringement  false designation of origin  trademark dilution  and unfair competition relating to mintek s distribution of dvd players bearing our registered trademarks without obtaining a license from us 
in the year ended december   we recognized  in revenue under the settlement agreement for royalties due on known units that could be identified as using our trademark and accounted for the remaining million as other income 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included approximately  in legal fees related to the mintek case 
legal fees related to mintek were approximately  for income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million on pre tax income of million 
this resulted in an annualized effective tax rate of 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million on pre tax income of million 
this resulted in an annualized effective tax rate of 
these rates differed from the statutory rates primarily due to state income taxes offset by benefits associated with the foreign rate differentials and research and development credits 
we expect the effective tax rate for will be approximately 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   due primarily to the increase in technology and film licensing revenues 
technology and film licensing revenues totaled million for  compared to million in  an increase of 
technology licensing revenues posted growth of for the period  driven primarily by the rapid increase in sales by our licensees of dvd based home entertainment systems that incorporate dts technology  such as audio video receivers  dvd players  and home theater in a box systems 
film and other content licensing grew by due primarily to revenues generated from increases in the number of us films released in the dts format  foreign language dubbed versions of major us films  and foreign original version films released with a dts soundtrack 
product sales and other revenues totaled million for  compared to million in in the consumer business  revenues for the year ended december  were million  a increase over the million recorded in the year ended december   due to the strength of the consumer electronics licensing activities discussed above 
cinema revenues were million for the year ended december   a increase over  as growth in film licensing revenues more than offset a decline in product related revenues 
gross profit consolidated gross profit improved to of revenues for the year ended december   from for the increase is due to changes in the mix of licensing and product revenues  as higher margin technology and film licensing comprised of revenues in the year ended december   up from of revenues in the prior year period 
gross profit associated with technology and film licensing revenues improved slightly to of related revenues for the year ended december  from in the prior year period 
this increase is primarily due to a favorable mix of technology licensing  which carries very little cost  relative to film licensing  which typically carries cost of to 
gross profit for our consumer business improved to of related revenues for the year ended december   from in the prior year 
the increase is due to the rapid growth of higher margin technology licensing revenues 
cinema business gross profit increased slightly to of related revenues for the year ended december  from in the prior year due to the higher revenues achieved in  which allowed certain fixed overhead costs to be spread over a larger revenue base 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to increases in salaries and related costs of million as we increased headcount to support our growth and professional services of million  which includes costs associated with our increased intellectual property compliance and enforcement activities and additional costs associated with operating as a public company 
the year to year increase also includes increases in advertising and promotion costs related to new product introductions  and insurance costs 
in addition to these growth factors  the amount includes  in expenses related to stock based compensation for options and warrants to purchase common stock 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to increased labor costs caused by increased headcount associated with new product initiatives and expenses associated with the optimization of our coherent acoustics technology for new consumer electronics applications 
research and development headcount increased from at december  to at december  interest income expense  net interest income expense  net  for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to increased investment income on higher average cash and investment balances arising from our initial public offering in july and our follow on public offering in november other expense  net other expense  net  decreased slightly for the year ended december  to  from  in the prior year 
other expense  net  for primarily consisted of financing commitment fees 
other expense  net  for primarily consisted of translation losses related to foreign currency fluctuations when consolidating our foreign subsidiaries 
income taxes income tax expense totaled million for the year ended december   representing an effective tax rate of  down from for year ended december  our effective tax rate reflects the full federal and state statutory rates on us taxable income net of available tax credits  combined with taxes expected to be paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions such as the united kingdom  china  and the british virgin islands 
the reduction in our effective tax rate in versus was due to an increase in taxable income of our non us subsidiaries as a percentage of consolidated taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million  compared to million at december  in addition  we had long term investments of and at december  and  respectively  and we view these long term investments as part of our overall cash and liquidity management 
since our inception  we have financed our operations through sales of redeemable preferred stock  borrowings under bank line of credit arrangements  internally generated cash flows and proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our bank facility  which expires on june  and automatically renews for one year 
the bank facility provides for working capital financing and is unsecured 
the bank agreement requires us to comply with certain covenants including a tangible effective net worth of million increasing by of net income on an annual basis 
the covenants also require us to keep million in cash or securities at the bank 
availability under this facility was million at december  future borrowings will bear interest based on either of the two options selected at the time of advances a rate equal to above the bank s libor  or a rate equal to the base rate as quoted from the bank less one half percent 
through december   we have raised million in cash through the sale of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  net proceeds of million from our initial public offering and net proceeds of million from our follow on public offering 
the preferred stock was redeemable at the original issuance price of per share plus dividends accumulating at per annum through october  and per annum from october  through the date of redemption 
we used approximately million from the proceeds of our initial public offering to redeem all shares of the preferred stock and to pay all accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares through the date of redemption 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   increased net income  adjusted for the million tax benefit related to employee stock plans and the million write down of inventory  was the primary reason for the increase in cash provided from operating activities over the prior years 
accounts receivable increased  for the year ended december  due to increases in receivables related to consumer license fees  offset by improved collections 
prepaid expenses and other assets increased million for the year ended december  primarily as result of acquisition related items  including restricted cash in connection with the qdesign corporation  or qdesign  acquisition and direct costs associated with the ldi acquisition 
also contributing to the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was an increase in deferred costs associated with deferred revenues 
upon the adoption of sfas r  the tax benefits for employee benefit plans will be included as a financing activity 
we use cash in investing activities primarily to purchase office equipment  fixtures  computer hardware and software  engineering and manufacturing test and certification equipment  for securing patent and trademark protection for our proprietary technology and brand name  and to purchase short term investments such as bank certificates of deposit  municipal bonds and auction rate securities 
cash used in investing activities totaled million  million  and million  respectively  in the years ended december    and in  and  million  and million  respectively  was used for the purchase of short and long term investments 
in december  in advance of our acquisition of ldi in january  we provided bridge financing of approximately million to ldi and acquired qdesign for net cash of million 
the principal and interest outstanding under the bridge loan reduced the price we paid to acquire ldi by the aggregate amount due 
we continue to invest in property and equipment  including office equipment and fixtures  engineering and manufacturing test equipment  and computer hardware and software 
net cash flows used in financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  cash provided by financing activities were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash used by financing activities consisted of the repayments under the bank line of credit 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities was million representing net proceeds of million from our initial public offering and proceeds of million from our follow on public offering 
these cash inflows were partially offset by cash dividends paid to our preferred stockholders totaling million as well as payments of million to redeem the principal value of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our option and employee stock purchase plans 
contractual obligations and commitments future payments due under non cancelable lease obligations and commitments at of december  are described below in thousands and thereafter total operating leases acquisition consideration total purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are typically based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts with manufacturers to provide certain manufacturing services 
if we were to have terminated these contracts at december   we would have to make payments of approximately million 
as part of the acquisition of ldi  in january  we agreed to invest million in the business of ldi on or prior to june  to enable ldi to make certain capital expenditures and  if and to the extent ldi meets specified gross profit milestones  to invest up to an additional million through the end of we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  funds available under our existing bank line of credit facility  and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we used a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering to redeem all outstanding shares of our redeemable preferred stock 
beyond the next twelve months  additional financing may be required to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
changes in our operating plans  lower than anticipated revenues  increased expenses  acquisitions of companies  products or technologies or other events  including those described in risk factors  may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing on an accelerated basis 
financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could negatively impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants and or financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate our business 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth the unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the eight quarters ended december   as well as the same data expressed as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated 
this information includes all adjustments management considers necessary for the fair presentation of such data 
the information for each quarter is unaudited and we have prepared it on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results 
the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
generally  consumer electronics manufacturing activities are lowest in the first calendar quarter of each year  and increase progressively throughout the remainder of the year 
the third and fourth quarters are typically the strongest in terms manufacturing output as our technology licensees increase their manufacturing output to prepare for the holiday buying season 
since recognition of revenues in our consumer business generally lags manufacturing activity by one quarter  our revenues and earnings are generally lowest in the second quarter 
film licensing revenues are typically strongest in the second and fourth quarters due to the abundance of movies typically released during the summer and year end holiday seasons 
in general  the introduction of new products and inclusion of dts technologies in new and rapidly growing markets can have a material effect on quarterly revenues and profits  and can distort the moderate seasonality described above

this continuing growth is a result of increases in manufacturing activity  including increased consumer demand for home theater products  use of our technology in new product categories  and increases in the number of consumer electronics licensees 
gross profit for the quarter ended december  was impacted by the write down of approximately million of our monochrome projector inventory 
interest and other income expense  net  increased in the quarter ended december  as a result of increased financing commitment fees expensed in the fourth quarter

risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we face intense competition from companies with greater brand recognition and resources 
the digital audio  consumer electronics  and entertainment markets are intensely competitive  subject to rapid change  and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
our principal competitor is dolby laboratories  inc  who competes with us in most of our markets 
we also compete with other companies offering digital audio technology incorporated into consumer electronics products and entertainment mediums  including coding technologies  fraunhofer institut integrierte schaltungen  koninklijke philips electronics nv philips  meridian audio limited  microsoft corporation  sony corporation  and thomson  and products for cinema markets  such as smart devices  inc  sony corporation  and ultra stereo labs  inc many of our current and potential competitors  including dolby  enjoy substantial competitive advantages  including greater name recognition  a longer operating history  more developed distribution channels and deeper relationships with semiconductor and consumer electronics products manufacturers  a more extensive customer base  digital technologies that offer greater compression and require less storage capacity  broader product and service offerings  greater resources for competitive activities  such as research and development  strategic acquisitions  alliances  joint ventures  sales and marketing  and lobbying industry and government standards  and more technicians and engineers 
as a result  these current and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards  or customer requirements 
in addition to the competitive advantages described above  dolby also enjoys other unique competitive strengths relative to us 
for example  it introduced multi channel audio technology before we did 
it has a larger base of installed movie theaters for its cinema playback equipment 
its technology has been incorporated in significantly more dvd video films than our technology 
it has also achieved mandatory standard status in a few product categories  including dvd video and dvd audio recordable  for its stereo technology and terrestrial digital television broadcasts in the united states 
as a result of these factors  dolby has a competitive advantage in selling its digital multi channel technology to consumer electronics products manufacturers 
sony corporation is both a competitor and a significant customer in all of our markets 
if sony decides to eliminate the use of our technology in its products or to compete with us more aggressively in our markets  the revenues that we derive from sony would be lower than expected 
current and future governmental and industry standards may significantly limit our business opportunities 
technology standards are important in the audio industry as they help to assure compatibility across a system or series of products 
generally  standards adoption occurs on either a mandatory basis  requiring a particular audio technology to be available in a particular product or medium  or an optional basis  meaning that a particular audio technology may be  but is not required to be  utilized 
for example  our technology for stereo playback has been selected as a mandatory standard for hd dvd 
both our digital multi channel technology and dolby s have optional status in the hd dvd standard 
in the standard for hd dvd  both dts and dolby technologies have been selected as mandatory standards 
various national governments have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for all digital television broadcasts  including cable  satellite  and terrestrial 
in the united states  dolby s technology has been selected as the sole  mandatory standard for terrestrial digital television broadcasts 
as a result  all digital terrestrial television broadcasts in the united states must include dolby s technology and must exclude any other format  including ours 
we do not know whether this standard will be reopened or amended 
if it is not  our technology may never be included in that standard 
certain large and developing markets  such as china  have not fully developed their digital television standards 
our technology may or may not ultimately be included in these standards 
as new technologies and entertainment mediums emerge  new standards relating to these technologies or mediums may develop 
new standards may also emerge in existing markets that are currently characterized by competing formats  such as the market for personal computers 
we may not be successful in our efforts to include our technology in any such standards 
we may not be able to evolve our technology  products  and services or develop new technology  products  and services that are acceptable to our customers or the changing market 
the market for our technology  products  and services is characterized by rapid technological change  new and improved product introductions  changing customer demands  evolving industry standards  and product obsolescence 
our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing technology  products  and services and to develop acceptable new technology  products  and services on a timely basis 
the development of enhanced and new technology  products  and services is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  highly skilled engineering and development personnel  and the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may not be able to identify  develop  market  or support new or enhanced technology  products  or services on a timely basis  if at all 
furthermore  our new technology  products  and services may never gain market acceptance  and we may not be able to respond effectively to evolving consumer demands  technological changes  product announcements by competitors  or emerging industry standards 
for example  we may not be able to effectively address concerns in the film and music industries relating to piracy in our current or future products 
any failure to respond to these changes or concerns would likely prevent our technology  products  and services from gaining market acceptance or maintaining market share 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our ability to compete could be harmed 
protection of our intellectual property is critical to our success 
patent  trademark  copyright  and trade secret laws and confidentiality and other contractual provisions afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
we face numerous risks in protecting our intellectual property rights  including the following our patents may be challenged or invalidated by our competitors  our pending patent applications may not issue  or  if issued  may not provide meaningful protection for related products or proprietary rights  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by employees  consultants  and advisors  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate in foreign countries  our competitors may produce competitive products or services that do not unlawfully infringe upon our intellectual property rights  and we may be unable to successfully identify or prosecute unauthorized uses of our technology 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights and brands will be adequate 
furthermore  despite our efforts  third parties may violate  or attempt to violate  our intellectual property rights 
infringement claims and lawsuits would likely be expensive to resolve and would require management s time and resources 
in addition  we have not sought  and do not intend to seek  patent and other intellectual property protections in all foreign countries 
in countries where we do not have such protection  products incorporating our technology may be lawfully produced and sold without a license 
we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 
companies that participate in the digital audio  consumer electronics  and entertainment industries hold a large number of patents  trademarks  and copyrights  and are frequently involved in litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
intellectual property disputes frequently involve highly complex and costly scientific matters  and each party generally has the right to seek a trial by jury which adds additional costs and uncertainty 
accordingly  intellectual property contests  with or without merit  could be costly and time consuming to litigate or settle  and could divert management s attention from executing our business plan 
in addition  our technology and products may not be able to withstand any third party claims or rights against their use 
if we were unable to obtain any necessary license following a determination of infringement or an adverse determination in litigation or in interference or other administrative proceedings  we may need to redesign some of our products to avoid infringing a third party s patent and could be required to temporarily or permanently discontinue licensing our products 
if we are unable to maintain and increase the amount of entertainment content released with dts audio soundtracks  demand for the technology  products  and services that we offer to consumer electronics products manufacturers may significantly decline 
we expect to derive a significant percentage of our revenues from the technology  products  and services that we offer to manufacturers of consumer electronics products 
to date  the most significant driver for the use of our technology in the home theater market has been the release of major movie titles with dts audio soundtracks 
we also believe that demand for our dts audio technology in emerging markets for multi channel audio  including homes  cars  personal computers  and video games and consoles  will be based on the number  quality  and popularity of the audio dvds  computer software programs  and video games released with dts audio soundtracks 
although we have existing relations with many leading providers of movie  music  computer  and video game content  none of our existing contracts require these parties to develop and release content with dts audio soundtracks 
in addition  we may not be successful in maintaining existing relationships or developing relationships with other existing providers or new market entrants that provide content 
as a result  we cannot assure you that a significant amount of content in movies  audio dvds  computer software programs  video games  or other entertainment mediums will be released with dts audio soundtracks 
if the amount  variety  and popularity of entertainment content released with dts audio soundtracks do not increase  consumer electronics products manufacturers that pay us per unit licensing fees may discontinue offering dts playback capabilities in the consumer electronics products that they sell 
if our independent auditors are unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of our shares 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring all public companies  including us  to include a report by management on internal controls over financial reporting in all annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  the public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must attest to and report on our management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting 
this requirement applies to our annual report on form k 
while we conduct rigorous reviews of our internal controls over financial reporting in order to comply with the section requirements  our independent auditors may interpret the section requirements and the related rules and regulations differently from us  or our independent auditors or management may not be satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or with the level at which these controls are documented  executed or reviewed 
in addition  many uncertainties remain regarding the requirements for auditor attestation  and guidance provided by the public accounting profession has changed frequently and materially to date 
further  the demand for competent audit resources has grown dramatically as a result of the requirements of section  and such demand may exceed available supply 
finally  in the event we make a significant acquisition  or a series of insignificant acquisitions  we may face significant challenges in implementing the required processes and procedures in the acquired operations 
as a result  our independent auditors may decline or be unable to attest to management s assessment or may issue a qualified report or management may identify material weaknesses 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 
if we are unsuccessful in appealing the internal revenue service s proposed adjustments  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the future results of operations 
in march  in connection with the us internal revenue service s  or irs  regular examination of our tax return for the year ended december   the irs proposed adjustments related to certain items included in our return 
we do not agree with the proposed adjustments and intend to appeal these adjustments 
if the irs prevails in its position  our federal income tax due for would increase by approximately million  plus interest 
the irs could make similar claims for years subsequent to in future audits 
although the final resolution of the adjustments is uncertain  based on currently available information  we believe that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or overall trends in the results of operations 
there is the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the matter is ultimately resolved  if it is resolved unfavorably  or in the period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
we have limited experience in licensing  re mixing  marketing  and directly selling multi channel audio content 
although we have established relations with a number of artists and music labels  we do not have any contractual agreements that require artists or music labels to provide us with music content to re mix and release in our proprietary dts audio format 
music companies may in the future be unwilling to license titles from their music catalogs to us 
in addition  our audio content competes with other multi channel formats  including super audio cd  which is a format developed jointly by philips and sony corporation 
as a result  we may have difficulty in obtaining rights to release a significant amount of audio content  and any content that we do release may not be commercially successful 
declining retail prices for consumer electronics products could force us to lower the license fees we charge our customers 
the market for consumer electronics products is intensely competitive and price sensitive 
retail prices for consumer electronics products that include our dts audio technology  such as dvd players and home theater systems  have decreased significantly and we expect prices to continue to decrease for the foreseeable future 
declining prices for consumer electronics products could create downward pressure on the licensing fees we currently charge our customers who integrate our technology into the consumer electronics products that they sell and distribute 
most of the consumer electronics products that include our audio technology also include dolby s multi channel audio 
as a result of pricing pressure  consumer electronics products manufacturers could decide to exclude our dts audio technology from their products altogether 
we have limited control over existing and potential customers and licensees decision to include our technology in their product offerings 
we are dependent on our customers and licensees including consumer electronics products manufacturers  semiconductor manufacturers  movie theaters  and producers and distributors of content for music  films  videos  and games to incorporate our technology in their products  purchase our products and services  or release their content in our proprietary dts audio format 
although we have license agreements with many of these companies  these license agreements do not require any minimum purchase commitments  and are on a non exclusive basis  and do not require incorporation of our technology or trademarks in their products 
our licensees and other manufacturers might not utilize our technology in the future 
our revenues from film producers and distributors and from the products and services that we offer to movie theaters would decline if the major us film producers and distributors decrease the number of films they release with dts audio soundtracks 
although all nine major film producers and distributors are customers of ours  we generally do not have contractual arrangements that require them to use our dts audio technology 
our cinema business depends on our having good relations with these film studios 
a deterioration in our relationship with any of these film studios could cause these customers to stop using our dts audio technology 
any significant decline in the release of motion pictures with dts audio soundtracks would decrease the demand for and revenues from the playback products and services that we offer to movie theaters 
in addition  other film studios throughout the world generally adopt the technologies used by the major us film studios 
therefore  if the major us film studios stop using our technology  we would not only lose the per movie licensing fee we receive from these customers  but may also lose per movie licensing fees from other film studios throughout the world 
if the movie industry adopts new digital cinema technology in place of current film technology  demand for our cinema products and services could decline 
the movie theater industry may transition from film based media to electronic based  or digital  media 
if this transition occurs  we may be unable to meaningfully respond with competitive product offerings 
in addition  if the film industry broadly adopts digital cinema  our technology and current product offerings could be rendered obsolete 
in such an event  demand by movie theaters for our playback systems  cinema processors  and systems for subtitling  captioning  and descriptive narration would decline 
the movie theater industry has suffered and may continue to suffer from an oversupply of screens  which has affected and may continue to affect demand for the products and services we offer to movie theaters 
our cinema business depends in part on the construction of new screens and the renovation of existing theaters that install our dts playback systems and cinema processors 
in recent years  aggressive building of megaplexes by companies that operate movie theaters has generated significant competition and resulted in an oversupply of screens in some domestic and international markets 
the resulting oversupply of screens led to significant declines in revenues per screen and  eventually  to an inability by many major film exhibitors to satisfy their financial obligations 
several major movie theater operators have reorganized through bankruptcy proceedings  and many movie theaters have closed 
as a result  our playback systems and cinema processors that we previously sold to movie theaters that have reorganized and closed have been relocated to other theaters or have been available for resale in the secondary market to movie theaters that might otherwise have purchased these products directly from us 
if movie theater operators decide to close a significant number of screens in the future or cut their capital spending  demand for our playback systems and cinema processors will decline 
we are dependent on our management team and key technical employees  and the loss of any of them could harm our business 
our success depends  in part  upon the continued availability and contributions of our management team  particularly jon kirchner  our president and chief executive officer  w 
paul smith  our senior vice president  research and development and john lowry  our chief technologist of dts digital images who became an employee upon the acquisition of ldi 
we also rely on the skills and talents of our engineering and technical personnel because of the complexity of our products and services 
several of our key engineers have been instrumental in the development of our technology 
important factors that could cause the loss of key personnel include our existing employment agreements with the members of our management team allow such persons to terminate their employment with us at any time  we do not have employment agreements with a majority of our key engineering and technical personnel  we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees  significant portions of the stock options held by the members of our management team are vested  and many of the stock options held by our executive officers provide for accelerated vesting in the event of a sale or change of control of our company 
the loss of key personnel or an inability to attract qualified personnel in a timely manner could slow our technology and product development and harm our ability to execute our business plan 
we have a limited operating history in many of our key markets 
although the first movie with a dts audio soundtrack was released in  we did not enter the home theater market until  and our technology has only recently been incorporated into other consumer electronics markets  such as car audio  personal computers  video games and consoles  portable electronics devices  and digital satellite and cable broadcast products 
as a result  the demand for our technology  products  and services and the income potential of these businesses are unproven 
in addition  because the market for digital audio technology is relatively new and rapidly evolving  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends  which could harm our business 
before investing in our common stock  you should consider the risks  uncertainties  and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as ours 
we may not be able to successfully address any or all of these risks 
our technology and products are complex and may contain errors that could cause us to lose customers  damage our reputation  or incur substantial costs 
our technology or products could contain errors that could cause our products or technology to operate improperly and could cause unintended consequences 
if our products or technology contain errors we could be required to replace them  and if any such errors cause unintended consequences we could face claims for product liability 
although we generally attempt to contractually limit our exposure to incidental and consequential damages  if these contract provisions are not enforced or are unenforceable for any reason  or if liabilities arise that are not effectively limited  we could incur substantial costs in defending and or settling product liability claims 
because we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future  we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability 
although we have been in business since  we have only achieved profits from our business operations in the last fourteen fiscal quarters 
we expect our operating expenses to increase as we  among other things expand our domestic and international sales and marketing activities  acquire businesses or technologies  increase our research and development efforts to advance our existing technology  products  and services and develop new technology  products  and services  hire additional personnel  including engineers and other technical staff  upgrade our operational and financial systems  procedures  and controls  and continue to assume the responsibilities of being a public company 
as a result  we will need to grow our revenues in order to maintain and increase our profitability 
in addition  we may fail to accurately estimate and assess our increased operating expenses as we grow 
we are subject to additional risks associated with our international operations 
we market and sell our products and services outside the united states  and currently have employees located in canada  china  england  japan  mexico  northern ireland  and spain 
many of our customers and licensees are located outside the united states 
as a key component of our business strategy  we intend to expand our international sales 
we face numerous risks in doing business outside the united states  including unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements  tariffs  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  trade embargos  and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  dependence on foreign distributors and their sales channels  longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  less effective and less predictable protection of intellectual property  changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region  particularly in emerging markets  fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the us dollar and the cost of currency exchange  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
such factors could cause our future international sales to decline 
our business practices in international markets are also subject to the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act 
if any of our employees is found to have violated these requirements  we could be subject to significant fines and other penalties 
our international revenue is mostly denominated in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make our technology  products  and services more expensive for international customers  which could cause them to decrease their purchases from us 
expenses for our subsidiaries are denominated in their respective local currencies 
significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we face risks in expanding our business operations in china 
one of our key strategies is to expand our business operations in china 
however  we may be unsuccessful in implementing this strategy as planned or at all 
factors that could inhibit our successful expansion into china include its historically poor recognition of intellectual property rights and poor performance in stopping counterfeiting and piracy activity 
if we are unable to successfully stop unauthorized use of our intellectual property and assure compliance by our chinese licensees  we could experience increased operational and enforcement costs both inside and outside china 
even if we are successful in expanding into china  we may be greatly impacted by the political  economic  and military conditions in china  taiwan  north korea  and south korea 
these countries have recently conducted military exercises in or near the other s territorial waters and airspace 
such disputes may continue or escalate  resulting in economic embargos  disruptions in shipping  or even military hostilities 
this could severely harm our business by interrupting or delaying production or shipment of our products or products that incorporate our technology 
we depend on several suppliers  manufacturers  and distributors for some of our products  and the loss of any of these suppliers  manufacturers  or distributors could harm our business 
we purchase a small number of parts from sole source suppliers 
in addition  our professional audio encoding devices and movie theater playback systems are manufactured according to our specifications by single third party manufacturers 
because we have no direct control over these third party suppliers and manufacturers  interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these third parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion 
in addition  if such suppliers or manufacturers are incapable of or unwilling to deliver the necessary parts or products  we may be unable to redesign our technology to work without such parts or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers 
in such events  we could experience interruptions  delays  increased costs  or quality control problems 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with three companies to serve as our sole distributors for our dts entertainment products in the united states and canada  europe and japan 
we have no direct control over these distributors and any problems with their performance may take time to identify and or remedy  and any remedial measures that we take may be unsuccessful 
in addition  if any of these distributors were to go out of business  as one of our previous distributors did  or otherwise becomes incapable of continuing as our distributor  we could experience delays in distributing our dts entertainment products to the retail market  loss of inventory  and loss of revenue 
we rely on the accuracy of our customers manufacturing reports for reporting and collecting our revenues  and if these reports are untimely or incorrect  our revenues could be delayed or inaccurately reported 
a significant percentage of our revenues are generated from our consumer electronics products manufacturer customers who license and incorporate our technology in their consumer electronics products 
under our existing arrangements  these customers pay us a per unit licensing fee based on the number of consumer electronics products manufactured that incorporate our technology 
we rely on our customers to accurately report the number of units manufactured in collecting our license fees  preparing our financial reports  projections  budgets  and directing our sales and product development efforts 
most of our license agreements permit us to audit our customers  but audits are generally expensive and time consuming and could harm our customer relationships 
if any of our customer reports understate the number of products they manufacture  we may not collect and recognize revenues to which we are entitled 
a prolonged economic downturn could materially harm our business 
negative trends in the general economy  including trends resulting from actual or threatened military action by the united states and threats of terrorist attacks on the united states and abroad  could cause a decrease in consumer spending on entertainment in general 
any reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general may affect the demand for consumer electronics products that incorporate our digital audio technology  audio dvds that we produce and distribute through our dts entertainment label  and demand by film studios and movie theaters for our cinema products and services 
we may not successfully address problems encountered in connection with any future acquisitions 
we expect to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other technologies  products  and businesses that could enhance our technical capabilities  complement our current products and services  or expand the breadth of our markets 
we have a limited history of acquiring and integrating businesses 
acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks  including problems assimilating the purchased technologies  products  or business operations  significant future charges relating to in process research and development and the amortization of intangible assets  significant amount of goodwill that is not amortizable and is subject to annual impairment review  problems maintaining uniform standards  procedures  controls  and policies  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  including accounting charges and transaction expenses  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions and strategic investments  our management team may be distracted from our day to day operations  our business may be disrupted  and our operating results may suffer 
in addition  if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders would be diluted 
we may have difficulty managing any growth that we might experience 
we expect to continue to experience growth in the scope of our operations and the number of our employees 
if this growth continues  it will place a significant strain on our management team and on our operational and financial systems  procedures  and controls 
our future success will depend in part on the ability of our management team to manage any growth effectively 
this will require our management to hire and train additional personnel in the united states and internationally  implement and improve our operational and financial systems  procedures  and controls  maintain our cost structure at an appropriate level based on the revenues we generate  manage multiple  concurrent development projects  and manage operations in multiple time zones with different cultures and languages 
any failure to successfully manage our growth could distract management s attention  and result in our failure to execute our business plan 
for instance  the ldi acquisition in has required significant time and attention from our management team 
any future growth could cause similar management challenges or create distractions 
we may experience fluctuations in our operating results 
we have historically experienced moderate seasonality in our business due to our business mix and the nature of our products 
in our consumer business  consumer electronics manufacturing activities are generally lowest in the first calendar quarter of each year  and increase progressively throughout the remainder of the year 
manufacturing output is generally strongest in the third and fourth quarters as our technology licensees increase manufacturing to prepare for the holiday buying season 
since recognition of revenues in our consumer business generally lags manufacturing activity by one quarter  our revenues and earnings from the consumer business are generally lowest in the second quarter 
film licensing revenues are generally strongest in the second and fourth quarters due to the abundance of movies typically released during the summer and year end holiday seasons 
the introduction of new products and inclusion of our technologies in new and rapidly growing markets can distort the moderate seasonality described above 
our revenues may continue to be subject to seasonal fluctuations in the future 
unanticipated fluctuations in seasonality could cause us to miss our earnings projections which could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  we actively engage in intellectual property compliance and enforcement activities focused on identifying third parties who have either incorporated our technology  trademarks  or know how without a license or who have underreported to us the amount of royalties owed under license agreements with us 
as a result of these activities  from time to time  we recognize royalty revenues that relate to consumer electronics manufacturing activities from prior periods 
these royalty recoveries may cause revenues to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and may not recur in future reporting periods 
such fluctuations in our revenues and operating results may cause declines in our stock price 
accounting for employee stock options using the fair value method will reduce our net income 
there has been ongoing public debate whether stock options granted to employees should be treated as compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
currently  we account for options using the intrinsic value method  which results in no compensation expense  since we granted employee options with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock at the time of grant 
if  however  we had used the fair value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees using a black scholes option valuation formula  our net income for the year ended december   would have been reduced by million  from million to million for the year ended december  when we adopt fas r in the third quarter of  we will have on going accounting charges significantly greater than those we would have recorded under our current method of accounting for stock options  which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
risks related to our common stock we expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations  announcements of technological innovations or technology standards  announcements of significant contracts by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  developments with respect to intellectual property rights  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  the commencement of or our involvement in litigation  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  conditions and trends in technology industries  changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors  the trading volume of our common stock  changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  the market prices of securities of technology companies have been particularly volatile 
these broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid 
as of december   we have  shares of common stock outstanding 
as a result of our relatively small public float  our common shares may be less liquid than the common shares of companies with broader public ownership 
among other things  trading of a relatively small volume of our common shares may have a greater impact on the trading price for our shares than would be the case if our public float were larger 
our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future  and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including acceptance of  and demand for  our products and technology  the costs of developing new products or technology  the extent to which we invest in new technology and research and development projects  the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions  and the costs associated with our expansion  if any 
in the future  we may need to raise additional funds  and such funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
furthermore  if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds  our existing stockholders may experience dilution  and the new equity or debt securities may have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services  execute our business plan  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements 
this may materially harm our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
anti takeover provisions under our charter documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control and could also limit the market price of our stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable 
some of these provisions authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval  with rights senior to those of the common stock  provide for a classified board of directors  with each director serving a staggered three year term  prohibit stockholders from filling board vacancies  calling special stockholder meetings  or taking action by written consent  and require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations 
in addition  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporate law  which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock 
these and other provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation  restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirors to obtain control of our board or initiate actions that are opposed by the then current board  including delay or impede a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest involving our company 
any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and foreign exchange rates 
at december   we did not have any balances outstanding under our bank line of credit arrangement  however  the amount of outstanding debt at any time may fluctuate and we may from time to time be subject to refinancing risk 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since a significant portion of our investments are and will be in short term marketable securities  us government securities and corporate bonds 
due to the nature and maturity of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure to our principal 
the average maturity of our investment portfolio is less than one month 
as of december   a change in interest rates throughout a one year period would have an annual effect of approximately million on our income 
we derive more than half of our revenues from sales outside the united states  and maintain research  sales  marketing  or business development offices in six countries 
therefore  our results could be negatively affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  trade protection measures  longer accounts receivable collection patterns  and changes in regional or worldwide economic or political conditions 
the risks of our international operations are mitigated in part by the extent to which our revenues are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  we are not exposed to significant foreign currency risk on these items 
we do have limited foreign currency risk on certain revenues and operating expenses such as salaries and overhead costs of our foreign operations and a small amount of cash maintained by these operations 
revenues denominated in foreign currencies accounted for approximately of total revenues during operating expenses  including cost of sales  for our foreign subsidiaries were approximately million in based upon the expenses for  a change in foreign currency rates throughout a one year period would have an annual effect of approximately  our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility when compared to the united states dollar 
accordingly  our future results could be materially impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we are also affected by exchange rate fluctuations as the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into the united states dollar in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and could adversely impact overall profitability 
during  the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to translation of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements were
