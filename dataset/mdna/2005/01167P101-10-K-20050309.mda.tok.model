item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
alaska communications systems group we generate revenue primarily through the provision of local telephone services  including basic local service to retail customers within our service areas  wholesale service to competitive local exchange carriers  or clecs  network access services to interexchange carriers for origination and termination of interstate and intrastate long distance phone calls  enhanced services  ancillary services  such as billing and collection  and universal service payments  the provision of wireless services  the provision of internet services  and the provision of interexchange network long distance and data services 
in addition  we provide video entertainment services through our partnership with the satellite operator  dish network 
local telephone we are the largest local exchange carrier lec in alaska and the th largest in the united states 
basic local service is generally provided at a flat monthly rate and allows the user to place unlimited calls within a defined local calling area 
access revenues are generated in part by billing interexchange carriers for access to the lec s local network and its customers and in part by billing the local customers themselves 
universal service revenues are a subsidy paid to rural lecs to support the high cost of providing service in rural markets 
changes in revenue are largely attributable to changes in the number of access lines  local service rates and minutes of use 
other factors can also impact revenue  including intrastate and interstate revenue settlement methodologies  authorized rates of return for regulated services  whether an access line is used by a business or consumer subscriber  intrastate and interstate calling patterns  customers selection of various local rate plan options  selection of enhanced calling services  such as voice mail  and other subscriber usage characteristics 
lecs have three basic tiers of customers consumer and business customers located in our local service areas that pay for local phone service and a portion of network access  interexchange carriers that pay for access to long distance calling customers located within our local service areas and clecs that pay for wholesale access to our network in order to provide competitive local service on either a wholesale or unbundled network element une basis as prescribed under the telecommunications act 
lecs provide access service to numerous interexchange carriers and may also bill and collect long distance charges from interexchange carrier customers on behalf of the interexchange carriers 
the amount of access charge revenue 
table of contents associated with a particular interexchange carrier varies depending upon long distance calling patterns and the relative market share of each long distance carrier 
our local service rates for end users are authorized by the regulatory commission of alaska  or rca 
authorized rates are set by the federal communications commission  or fcc  and the rca for interstate and intrastate access charges  respectively  and may change from time to time 
wireless we are the second largest statewide provider of wireless services in alaska  currently serving over  subscribers 
our wireless network footprint covers over  residents  including all major population centers and highway and ferry corridors 
we currently operate a tdma digital network in substantially all of our service areas  and are rolling out a new generation of digital network known as cdma xrtt  which provides customers with improved voice call quality  average mobile data speeds of kbps and provides a platform for the launch of enhanced services 
we began offering cdma xrtt services in several of our service areas in may in june we began offering wireless broadband service based on ev do which enables high speed data connectivity with speeds that burst up to mbps to our wireless markets in anchorage  fairbanks  and juneau 
we estimate that the new cdma service currently covers of our wireless footprint of  residents 
internet we are the second largest provider of internet access services in alaska with over  customers 
we offer dial up and dedicated dsl internet access to our customers 
we are a single source provider of advanced ip based private networks in alaska 
interexchange we provide switched and dedicated long distance services to over  customers in alaska 
the traffic from these customers is carried over our owned or leased facilities 
video entertainment we provide video entertainment services on a resale basis through our partnership with the satellite provider  dish network 
the current agreement with the provider became effective august and will either be renegotiated or terminate in december critical accounting policies and accounting estimates management is responsible for the financial statements herein and has evaluated the accounting policies used in their preparation 
management believes these policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  description of company and summary of significant accounting policies  to the alaska communications systems group  inc consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion identifies those accounting policies that management believes are critical in the preparation of our financial statements  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the possibility that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting the financial statements are those related to the realizable value of accounts receivable  long lived assets in particular  those assets accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  income taxes  network access revenue reserves and litigation reserves 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we use an allowance method to estimate the net realizable value of accounts receivable 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million 
actual collection results could vary significantly from management s estimate 
access revenue is recognized when earned 
we participate in access revenue pools with other telephone companies 
such pools are funded by toll revenue and or access charges regulated by the rca within the intrastate jurisdiction and the fcc within the interstate jurisdiction 
much of the interstate access revenue is initially recorded based on estimates 
these estimates are derived from interim financial statements  available separations studies and the most recent information available about achieved rates of return 
these estimates are subject to adjustment in future accounting periods as additional operational 
table of contents information becomes available 
to the extent that disputes arise over revenue settlements  our policy is to defer revenue collected until settlement methodologies are resolved and finalized 
at december   we had recorded liabilities of million related to our estimate of refundable access revenue 
actual results could vary from this estimate 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes reflect the temporary differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the cumulative valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was million as of december   which represents of all deferred tax assets 
our local telephone exchange operations account for costs in accordance with the accounting principles for regulated enterprises prescribed by sfas no 
this accounting recognizes the economic effects of rate regulation by recording cost and a return on investment as such amounts are recovered through rates authorized by regulatory authorities 
accordingly  under sfas no 
 plant and equipment is depreciated over lives approved by regulators and certain costs and obligations are deferred based upon approvals received from regulators to permit recovery of such amounts in future years 
we implemented  effective january   higher depreciation rates for our regulated telephone plant for the interstate jurisdiction which management believes approximate the economically useful lives of the underlying plant 
as a result  we have recorded a regulatory asset under sfas no 
of million as of december  related to depreciation of the regulated telephone plant allocable to its intrastate and local jurisdictions 
we have also deferred as a regulatory asset million of costs incurred in connection with regulatory rate making proceedings  which is being amortized over three years starting in the balance of this regulatory asset was million at december  if we were not following sfas no 
 we would have recorded additional cumulative depreciation expense of million for the intrastate and local jurisdictions and the deferred costs incurred in connection with regulatory rate making proceedings would have been charged to expense as incurred 
we also have a regulatory liability of million at december  related to accumulated removal costs 
if we were not following sfas no 
 we would have followed sfas no 
for asset retirement obligations 
non regulated revenues and costs incurred by the local telephone exchange operations and our non regulated operations are not accounted for under sfas no 
principles 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with the guidelines of this accounting principle  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but will be assessed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level upon adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss would be recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the unit may be impaired 
the amount  if any  of the impairment is then measured in the second step 
we determined the fair value of each reporting unit for purposes of this test primarily by using a discounted cash flow valuation technique 
significant estimates used in the valuation include estimates of future cash flows  both future short term and long term growth rates  and estimated cost of capital for purposes of arriving at a discount factor 
at december   we had recorded goodwill of million applicable to our local telephone and wireless segments and intangible assets of million related primarily to our wireless segment 
we are involved in various claims  legal actions and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  and have recorded litigation reserves of million against certain claims and legal actions as of december  we believe that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows beyond the amounts already recorded 
estimates involved in developing these litigation reserves could change as these claims  legal actions and regulatory proceedings are resolved

see item business regulation for further discussion 
local network service revenue decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   while access lines in service decreased to  the decrease in revenue primarily reflects the net effect of retail access line losses representing a revenue reduction of approximately million offset by increases in une rates and average unes in service representing a revenue increase of approximately million 

table of contents network access revenue decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in network access revenue reflects the loss of retail access lines  offset by increases in special access revenue and ongoing true ups to prior years interstate access and universal service fund studies 
network access revenue is based on a regulated return on rate base and recovery of allowable expenses associated with the origination and termination of toll calls for our retail and resale customers 
management expects that network access revenue will decline as a component of local telephone revenue for the foreseeable future 
deregulated and other revenue  which increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   consists principally of billing and collection services  space and power rents  deregulated equipment sales  paystation revenue  regulated directory listing revenue  and other miscellaneous telephone revenue 
wireless 
wireless revenue increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the following growth in average subscribers of for the year ended december  over the prior year period  an increase in monthly average revenue per unit  or arpu  of to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased plan revenue  roaming  and regulatory surcharges  and higher gross customer adds in the year ended december  resulting in million of handset revenue compared to million for the year ended december  internet 
internet revenue decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the loss of million in revenue associated with the state of alaska tpa  which was terminated in october  offset by approximately million of revenue increases primarily as a result of growth in dsl subscribers of to  at december   from  at december  interexchange 
interexchange revenue decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decline was primarily due to the termination of services to the state of alaska tpa  which accounted for million in revenue  offset by an increase in long distance subscribers of  or  from  in to  in total minutes of use decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  operating expenses operating expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  included in operating expenses for is approximately million of expenses attributable to the state of alaska tpa  contract termination and asset impairment charges of million  and a net gain on disposal of assets of million

depreciation and amortization associated with the operation of each of our segments has been included in total depreciation and amortization 
local telephone 
the components of local telephone expense are plant specific operations  plant non specific operations  customer operations  corporate operations and property and other operating tax expense 
local telephone expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in local telephone expense was substantially attributable to million of organizational restructuring costs including million of consulting  million of hiring  recruiting and severance costs  and million of early lease termination expense  million of inventory write downs  
table of contents and million of other unusual charges 
we also implemented a contractual wage increase for our represented employees of approximately on january  wireless 
wireless expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to a million increase in the cost of equipment associated with customer acquisition as we experienced  gross customer additions during compared to  in the prior year  an increase in leased circuit and outside services costs increase of million associated with our cdma deployment during  and additional roaming expense 
internet 
internet expenses decreased by million  or 
the decrease in internet expense was due principally to the termination of the state of alaska tpa  which had incurred million of expense during with no corresponding tpa expense in the elimination of expenses associated with the tpa was partially offset by additional expenses associated with a increase in dsl subscribers over the prior year 
interexchange 
interexchange expenses decreased by million  or 
million of this decrease was attributable to costs associated with the state of alaska tpa  which was terminated during the fourth quarter of additionally  minutes of use decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  contract termination and asset impairment charges 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in contract termination and asset impairment charges for which no corresponding charges were incurred during these charges resulted from the termination of the tpa with the state of alaska and an impairment of fiber optic indefeasible rights of use and ip network and service center assets resulting from the termination of the tpa as well as changes in the communications industry and the economy

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  primarily as a result of a decline in net property  plant and equipment of from million at december  to million at december  much of the decline in net property  plant and equipment resulted from the loss on disposal and asset impairment charges incurred during the third quarter of  as described above 
loss gain on disposal of assets 
on april   we entered into an underwriting agreement to sell a majority interest in our directories business and on april  filed a final prospectus to offer this majority interest to investors through a canadian income fund 
the transaction was completed on may   with us selling an interest and retaining a interest in our directories business 
we recognized a gain on disposition of this majority interest of our directories business of million on a pre tax basis during subsequently on august   we disposed of substantially all of our remaining interest through the exercise of our right to convert of our then remaining interest to million units of the acs media income fund  which were then sold in an underwritten offering 
the transaction settled on september   generating million in net 
table of contents proceeds and a gain on disposition of million 
as a result of this transaction  we now own less than of the directories business 
we recorded a non cash loss on the disposal of certain fixed assets of million during compared to million during  exclusive of the gain on the sale of our directories business 
interest expense and interest income and other interest expense decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of the early extinguishments of outstanding debt of million during the second quarter of and the refinancing of million during the third quarter of  million of debt issuance cost was charged to interest expense 
we also extinguished early our interest rate swap contract during the fourth quarter of this swap contract accounted for million of interest expense 
these reductions to interest expense were partially offset by higher interest associated with our senior unsecured notes due  which were in effect for the full year of compared to approximately one quarter during  and higher variable interest rates on principal outstanding under our senior bank credit facilities experienced during compared to interest income and other increased from a net expense of million for to income of million for  or a positive year over year variance of million  due substantially to a million non operating impairment loss on a note receivable offset by the million gain on foreign exchange on the sale of the directories business  both of which were recorded during income taxes we have fully reserved the income tax benefit resulting from the consolidated losses we have incurred since may   the date of the acquisition of substantially all of our operations 
during  we received a refund of prior year estimated alternative minimum taxes of million 
loss from discontinued operations during  we completed a plan we adopted on march  to dispose of our former wireless television segment  which resulted in a loss on disposal of million for net loss the increase in net loss is primarily a result of the factors discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues operating revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  wireless  internet  and interexchange revenues increased compared to the prior period  while local telephone decreased

retail access lines decreased  or to  at december  approximately  of the decrease in retail access lines was due to a change in the counting methodology adopted for and later periods to exclude company use of our access lines 
we experienced a loss of direct retail customers during the year as customers cancelled second lines they were not using or switched to competing service providers 
this reduction in direct retail customers was partially offset by an increase in wholesale lines 
generally  if a retail local network service customer of ours switches to a competitor  we continue to provide the line to the competitor on a wholesale basis at reduced revenue per line 
management believes that the continuing loss of market share we have experienced in certain of our markets is partially attributable to below cost interconnection rates mandated by the rca for unes 
on october   the rca granted acsa an interim une rate increase of  bringing the une rate up from to 
the interim and refundable rate increase was implemented in november and generated approximately million in additional revenue during see item business regulation for further discussion 
network access revenues decreased by million  or  from million in to million in during the second quarter of  we recognized as revenue million of previously deferred interstate access revenue related to a dispute on interstate access rates for the anchorage market based on a favorable ruling by the district of columbia court of appeals 
network access revenue is based on a regulated return on rate base and recovery of allowable expense associated with the origination and termination of toll calls for our retail and resale customers 
excluding the impact of the revenue recognized as a result of the favorable ruling by the court  the increase in network access revenues of million compared to the corresponding period in is due primarily to updated access studies 
management expects that network access revenues will generally be on a declining trend for the foreseeable future 
deregulated and other revenues  which increased million  or from  consists principally of billing and collection services  space and power rents  deregulated equipment sales  pay station revenues  regulated directory listing revenue  and other miscellaneous telephone revenues 
the increase in deregulated and other revenue was due primarily to an increase in rents and billing and collection revenue 

table of contents wireless 
wireless revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to growth in average subscribers of from  in to  in subscriber average monthly minutes of use increased from minutes in to minutes in primarily as a result of increased minutes of use over plan allotments  the monthly average revenue per unit  or arpu  increased from in to in internet 
internet revenues increased from million in to million in an increase of million  or 
this increase is primarily due to revenue associated with our contract with the state of alaska and because approximately million of this increase was earned in the prior year but could not be estimated and therefore was not recorded until the current year 
internet also experienced growth in dsl subscribers of from  at december  to  at december  on september   we received notification from the state of alaska that it intended to terminate a five year tpa with us and disentangle 
subsequently  we negotiated with the state and agreed to a definitive settlement agreement and mutual release effective october   outlining the terms of disentanglement between the parties 
state of alaska contract revenues included in internet were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interexchange 
interexchange revenue increased from million in to million in an increase of million  or 
long distance subscribers decreased from approximately  at december  to  at december  the decrease in subscribers was substantially due to database grooming to remove approximately  non revenue generating inactive subscribers from the subscriber list in connection with the conversion of long distance billing from an outside service bureau to an in house system during the first and second quarters of the average revenue per unit  or arpu  increased to in compared to during and total minutes of use decreased from million in to million in the decline in minutes of use was due to increased competition in the marketplace  and the popularity of discount long distance calling cards 
currently  we have a low penetration on this product  but we expect our market share to grow as we increasingly offer attractive bundles to our customers  which may offset declines in interexchange revenue due to the termination of the state of alaska contract 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  included in operating expenses for is a net gain on disposal of assets of million and contract termination and asset impairment charges of million

we negotiated with the state and agreed to a definitive settlement agreement and mutual release effective october   terminating the contract and outlining the terms of disentanglement between the parties 
we anticipate expense for this segment to decline as we complete the disentanglement under the contract 
interexchange 
interexchange expenses increased by million  or 
the majority of this increase was caused by an increase in billing and collection fees  toll switching and litigation reserves in contract termination and asset impairment charges 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in contract termination and asset impairment charges 
these charges resulted from the termination of the tpa with the state of alaska and an impairment of fiber optic indefeasible rights of use and ip network and service center assets resulting from the termination of the tpa as well as changes in the communications industry and the economy

the million term loan under the senior credit facility was drawn on february  and generally bears interest at an annual rate of libor plus  with a term of seven years from the date of closing and no scheduled principal payments before maturity 
the million undrawn revolving credit facility  to the extent drawn in the future  will bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus and have a term of six years from the date of closing 
to the extent the million revolving credit facility under the senior credit facility remains undrawn  we will pay an annual commitment fee of of the undrawn principal amount over its term 
we also entered into floating to fixed interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of approximately million that swap the floating interest rate on a portion of the term loan borrowings under the senior credit facility for a fixed rate of per year 
three month libor was approximately on february  see note  subsequent events  to the alaska communications systems group  inc consolidated financial statements  for additional information about the equity offering and refinancing transactions 
on july   we fulfilled a commitment to crest to provide a loan for the aggregate principal amount of million in return for certain consideration 
we have an agreement that enables us to purchase additional fiber optic capacity in future years from crest  the expenditures for which are expected to be significant and may exceed million over the next two years 
we purchased additional capacity under this agreement for million during while we have an agreement with crest  certain material terms of the agreement remain subject to continued renegotiation 
the significant provisions of this agreement are i purchase commitments by us for capacity in and  the final price and quantity of which are subject to future events  ii crest s restoration of our traffic carried on another cable system and iii specific interconnection arrangements between us and crest  should we exercise our option to purchase certain network assets from crest 
we are

the implementation of our interexchange network and data services strategy is also capital intensive 
capital expenditures for were million  of which million was expended on cdma xrtt build out and million was expended on the crest fiber optic capacity purchases 
we intend to fund future capital expenditures with cash on hand  through internally generated cash flows  and if necessary  through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at december  we had allocated million of our current unrestricted cash balance of million to fund the completion over the next two years of our cdma xrtt and ev do build out and to secure fiber capacity within alaska and to the lower states in the united states under the terms of our agreement with crest 
our capital requirements may change due to impacts of regulatory decisions that affect our ability to recover our investments  changes in technology  the effects of competition  changes in our business strategy  and our decision to pursue specific acquisition opportunities  among other things 
we announced on october  the adoption of a dividend policy by our board of directors and declared our first quarterly dividend of per share  payable on january  to holders of record on december  while we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends  such payment is subject to our future operating and financial performance  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and other factors 
accordingly  our board of directors may modify or revoke this policy at any time 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters dividends 
simultaneous with the announcement of the dividend policy  we also announced the withdrawal of our registration statements for a proposed initial public offering of income deposit securities  a separate proposed offering of senior subordinated notes and the proposed reclassification of our existing common stock into cash and shares of new class b common stock which we had filed with the sec 
no securities were sold under the withdrawn registration statements 
subsequent to december   we issued million shares of our common stock in an equity offering that closed on february  and  through the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option  an additional million shares that closed on march  as a result of these issuances  we have outstanding million shares as of march  the issuance of these additional shares of our common stock will increase our aggregate annual dividend payments by approximately million to approximately million annually based on our current dividend policy of per share per year 
see note  subsequent events  to the alaska communications systems group  inc consolidated financial statements  for additional information about the offering of our common stock 
we believe that we will have sufficient working capital provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to service our debt  pay our quarterly dividends  fund our operations  capital expenditures and other obligations over the next months 
our ability to meet such obligations will be dependent upon our future financial performance  which is  in turn  subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control

in december  the fasb issued fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
fin r provides guidance on how to identify variable interest entities and how to determine whether or not those entities should be consolidated 
we were required to apply fin r by the end of the first reporting period after march   for entities which were created before february  the adoption of fin r was immediate for variable interest entities created after january  we have evaluated the provisions of fin r and determined that we do not have any variable interest entities that require consolidation in our financial statements

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas requires companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and to record compensation cost for all stock awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
in addition  we are required to record compensation expense as previous awards continue to vest for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
sfas will be effective for our third quarter ending september  we have not yet determined the impact that sfas will have on our financial position and results of operations  but expects that the stock incentive plans disclosure provided in note  description of company and summary of significant accounting policies  to the alaska communications systems group  inc consolidated financial statements  provides a reasonable measure of the expected annual impact 
outlook we expect that  overall  the demand for telecommunications services in alaska will grow  particularly as a result of increasing demand for wireless voice and data services following the launch of our cdma xrtt network  growth in demand for dsl and internet access services due to higher business and consumer bandwidth needs  and increasing demand for private network services by government and business on a statewide basis on either a circuit switched or ip basis 
we believe that we will be able to capitalize on this demand through our diverse service offerings on our owned circuit switched and ip facilities  new sales and marketing initiatives directed toward basic voice  enhanced and data services  and offering customers an integrated bundle of telecommunication services including local telephone  wireless  internet  long distance  messaging and video entertainment 
consistent with the us telecommunications industry  we experienced a loss in network access lines during the year as customers cancelled second lines  replaced wireline services with wireless  and lines migrated to cable telephony 
our primary une customer has announced plans to migrate most of its anchorage area customers to its own cable telephony plant during the next three years 
consequently  we anticipate that these trends will continue 
there are currently a number of regulatory proceedings underway at the state and federal levels that could have a significant impact on our operations 
we cannot predict with certainty the impact of current or future regulatory developments on any of our businesses 
the telecommunications industry is extremely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
as an ilec  we face competition mainly from resellers  local providers who lease our unes and from providers of local telephone services over separate facilities 
moreover  while wireless telephone services have historically complemented traditional lec services  we anticipate that existing and emerging wireless technologies may increasingly compete with lec services 
similarly  local and interexchange service competition may come from cable television providers and voice over ip providers 
in wireless services  we currently compete with at least one other wireless provider in each of our wireless service areas 
in the highly 
table of contents competitive business for internet access services  we currently compete with a number of established online service companies  interexchange carriers and cable companies 
in the interexchange market  we believe we currently have less than of total revenue in alaska and face competition from two major interexchange providers 
the telecommunications industry is subject to continuous technological change 
we expect that new technological developments in the future will generally serve to enhance our ability to provide service to our customers 
however  these developments may also increase competition or require us to make significant capital investments to maintain our leadership position in alaska 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation on our financial results has not been significant in the periods presented
