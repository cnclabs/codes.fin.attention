part i item business introduction blonder tongue is a designer  manufacturer and supplier of a comprehensive line of electronics and systems equipment  primarily for the cable television industry both franchise and non franchise  or private  cable 
over the past few years  the company has also introduced equipment and innovative solutions for the high speed transmission of data and the provision of telephony services in multiple dwelling unit applications 
the company s products are used to acquire  distribute and protect the broad range of communications signals carried on fiber optic  twisted pair  coaxial cable and wireless distribution systems 
these products are sold to customers providing an array of communications services  including television  high speed data internet and telephony  to single family dwellings  multiple dwelling units mdus  the lodging industry and institutions such as hospitals  prisons  schools and marinas 
staying at the forefront of the communications broadband technology revolution is a continuing challenge 
the company continues to add products to respond to the changes taking place 
blonder tongue s most recent additions are a line of telephony products for the purpose of offering primary telephone service to mdus and the megaport line of high speed data products to provide broadband access to lodging and mdu communities 
other product additions over the past few years include digital satellite receivers  fiber communications network components  qpsk to qam transcoders for echostar and digicipher ii mpeg satellite services  digicipher ii compatible qam set top converters  and a broad range of interdiction products 
this past year the company introduced psk to qam transcoders for satellite delivered hdtv channels and an hdtv processor for over the air hdtv channels 
the company s principal customers are cable system integrators both franchise and private cable operators  as well as contractors that design  package  install and in most instances operate  upgrade and maintain the systems they build 
the company has historically enjoyed  and continues to enjoy  a dominant market position in the private cable industry  while progressively making inroads into the franchise cable market 
as the company has expanded its market coverage  however  the distinctions between private cable and franchise cable have become blurred 
for example  the most efficient  highest revenue producing private cable systems and small franchise cable systems are built with the same electronic building blocks 
most of the electronics required for these systems are available from blonder tongue 
the company continues to expand its core product lines headend and distribution  to maintain its ability to provide all of the electronic equipment needed to build small cable systems and much of the equipment needed in larger systems for the most efficient operation and highest profitability in high density applications 
over the past several years  the company has expanded beyond its core business by acquiring a private cable television system bdr broadband  llc and by acquiring an interest in a company offering a private telephone program ideally suited to multiple dwelling unit applications blonder tongue telephone  llc 
bdr broadband  llc bdr broadband  a owned subsidiary of the company  acquired the rights of entry for certain mdu cable television and high speed data systems in august the systems are presently comprised of approximately  existing mdu cable television subscribers and approximately  passings taking into account the sale during of the rights of entry for two systems located outside the region where the remaining systems are located 
bdr broadband is a venture between the company and priority systems  llc  which has expertise in marketing and operating mdu cable television systems 
during july  the company purchased the interest in bdr broadband that had been originally owned by paradigm capital investments  llc  for an aggregate purchase price of  resulting in the company s stake in bdr broadband increasing from to 
the company believes that the model it has devised for acquiring and operating these systems has been successful and can be replicated 
the company is seeking opportunities to acquire additional rights of entry and is presently negotiating several such opportunities  although there is no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating these transactions 
the company entered into a series of agreements in march   and september  pursuant to which it acquired a economic ownership interest in netlinc communications  llc and blonder tongue telephone  llc to which the company has licensed its name 
as a result of these acquisitions  the company is now involved in providing a proprietary telephone system ideally suited for mdu deployment in both products and services 
the company receives incremental revenues associated with its direct sales of the telephony products  and it also expects to receive additional revenues from telephony services provided by or through contracts for such services obtained by bdr broadband  blonder tongue telephone  llc through the company s stake therein  as well as joint ventures with third parties 
the company continues to acquire additional rights of entry for the provision of video  voice and or high speed data services  albeit at a modest pace 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for a more detailed description of the investments in the private cable operation and telephone program and the underlying operations 
the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in november  and completed its initial public offering in december  industry overview the broadband signal distribution industry involving the high speed transmission of television  telephony and internet signals is currently dominated by franchise multiple system cable operators  or msos 
the markets for wireless  direct broadcast satellite dbs and digital subscriber lines dsl used for these purposes continue to grow 
within the cable television market there are an increasing number of metropolitan areas that have awarded second cable television franchises to create competition with the existing franchisee 
the government has been in favor of competition in this market and has passed regulations to encourage it 
franchise cable companies carefully monitor dbs penetration in their franchise areas and react rapidly to competition  all to the eventual benefit of the consumer 
to fight competition  the operators offer more services and more television channels as well as discounted prices 
the lineup of services typically includes an analog block of channels from to mhz  high speed data service using high speed cable modems  cable telephony either interfacing with switched networks or internet protocol networks  and digital television in the to mhz range 
these upgraded services are possible in every system that has been rebuilt to mhz of bandwidth 
the standard architecture for these enhanced systems contemplates a hybrid distribution network with a combination of fiber optic cable to nodes of to subscribers  with coaxial cable from the node to the customer and full reverse path capability for the pay per view  video on demand  data and phone services 
the traditional customer targeted for these expanded services is a homeowner likely to remain in the same home as a long term subscriber ie the single family home 
for a variety of reasons  including the transient nature of the residents of many mdu areas  high levels of theft of service and excessive cost of replacing lost or stolen converters and modems  affect approximately of cable television subscribers 
since converters  dbs receivers  digital converters and modems are offered at very low prices to stimulate sales  the operational costs in these demographic areas are considered too high to justify offering the advanced services that are generally made available in the traditional franchise cable demographic 
to retain customers in these areas  a technology must be used that minimizes the operational losses due to theft and churn while providing a level of video  data and phone service that compares favorably with single family offerings  dbs  dsl and wireless providers 
the company believes that its triple play of products  which includes qam delivered digital video  interdiction to control analog video  as well as high speed data and telephone service  is the ideal solution for deployment in these areas 
the company is a value added distributor for motorola s qam decoder to the united states private cable and canadian franchise cable markets 
coupling this product with the company s digicipher ii compatible qtm transcoder line of products  provides a low cost hardware solution for small system operators that want to offer digital programming from sources such as hits and echostar 
the company s transcoder line has been further enhanced to include the high definition tv transcoder series  which is intended for use with dish commercial tv from echostar and its hdtv processor for delivery of off air hdtv signals over the systems distribution network 
cable television most cable television operators have built fiber optic networks with various combinations of fiber optic and coaxial cable to deliver television signal programming  data  and phone services on one drop cable 
cable television deployment of fiber optic trunk has been completed in most existing systems 
the system architecture being employed to accomplish the combined provision of television  high speed data and telephone service is a hybrid fiber coaxial hfc network 
in an hfc network  fiber optic trunk lines connect to nodes which typically feed to subscribers  using coaxial cable 
the company believes that most major metropolitan areas will eventually have complex networks of two or more independent operators interconnecting homes  while private cable operators will provide service to many multi dwelling complexes 
all of these networks are potential users of blonder tongue headend  digital  telephone and interdiction products 
multiple dwelling units mdus mdus  because they represent a large percentage of the private cable market  have historically been responsible for a large percentage of the company s sales 
in the early days of cable television mdus were served by franchise cable operators 
in  when the fcc allocated a designated frequency band for private cable  the private cable industry became a major supplier of tv services to mdus since they could interconnect buildings with ghz over the air links and reduce the cost per subscriber in building mdu networks 
of course  in the cost of a headend was significantly higher than today 
this type of networking continues today  however  presently some mdu private cable systems are connected using fiber optics since it is more reliable  has much greater bandwidth  and can handle two way communication  which is required for voice  data and video on demand 
most new systems deploy lower cost dedicated headends and by supplying all three services video  voice and high speed data  have significantly greater revenues per subscriber  thereby significantly improving the return on investment over what was possible years ago 
a typical private cable mdu provides to channels of analog signals  as many as digital video channels  high speed data and telephone services  utilizing the company s core headend products receivers  modulators  transcoders  processors  etc  primary telephone equipment and distribution products 
mdus served by franchise cable are also a large potential revenue source for blonder tongue since they generally fall into the category of customers where churn  theft of service and converter loss are extremely high 
this makes these areas prime candidates for blonder tongue s interdiction products 
lodging since the early s  private cable integrators have competed to expand the lodging market by offering systems with more channels  video on demand and interactivity 
these systems have been and continue to be well received in the market  as property owners have sought additional revenues and guests have demanded increased in room conveniences 
the leading system integrators in this market rely upon outside suppliers for their system electronics and most are blonder tongue customers 
these companies and others offer lodging establishments systems that provide true video on demand movies with a large selection of titles 
to meet these demands  the typical lodging system headend will include as many as to receivers and as many as to modulators  and will be capable of providing the guest with more free channels  video on demand for a broad selection of movie titles  and interactive services such as remote check out and concierge services 
this is in contrast to the systems which preceded them  which typically had to receivers and modulators and provided six to ten free channels and two to five channels of vcr based movies running at published scheduled times 
most of the systems with video on demand service were initially in large hotels  where the economics of high channel capacity systems are more easily justified 
the conversion of hotel pay per view systems into video on demand is increasing 
smaller hotels and motels are being provided with video on demand as technology results in reduced headend costs  keeping the market growth reasonably steady 
a current trend in lodging is to provide plug and play high speed data service to customers and blonder tongue s megaport high speed data product is an ideal solution for hotel motel high speed data deployment 
international cable television service for much of the world is expanding as technological advancement reduces the cost to consumers 
in addition  economic development in latin america and asia has allowed construction of integrated delivery systems that utilize a variety of electronics and broadband hardware 
the pace of growth is difficult to predict  but as more alternatives become available and television service becomes increasingly affordable  it is anticipated that more equipment will be placed in the field 
the company utilizes several distributors in florida and within latin america to serve the latin american market  although during the last several years international sales have not materially contributed to the company s revenue base 
additional considerations the technological revolution with respect to video  data and voice services continues at a rapid pace 
cable tv s qam video is competing with directv and echostar s dbs service  cable modems compete with dsl offered by the regional bell operating companies rboc  rboc s are building national fiber networks and threatening to deliver video  data and voice services directly to the home over fiber optic cable  and voice over ip voip is being offered by cable companies and others in competition with traditional phone companies 
there is also the possibility of convergence of data and video communications  wherein computer and television systems merge and the computer monitor replaces the television screen 
while it is not possible to predict with certainty which technology will be dominant in the future  it is clear that digitized video and advances in the ability to compress the digitized video signal make both digital television and the convergence of computer  telephone and television systems technically possible 
since united states television sets are for the most part analog not digital  direct satellite television and other digitally compressed programming requires headend products or set top decoding receivers or converters to convert the digitally transmitted satellite signals back to analog 
the replacement of all television sets with digital sets will be costly and take many years to complete 
the company believes that for many years to come  program providers will deliver an analog television signal on standard channels to subscribers television sets using headend products at some distribution point in their networks or employ decoding receivers at each television set 
headend products are a large segment of blonder tongue s business and the company believes interdiction is an ideal product for a system operator to use to control access to the multitude of analog programming that will be available 
products blonder tongue s products can be separated  according to function  into the several categories described below analog video headend products used by a system operator for signal acquisition  processing and manipulation for further transmission 
among the products offered by the company in this category are satellite receivers  integrated receiver decoders  transcoders  demodulators  modulators  antennas and antenna mounts  amplifiers  equalizers  and processors 
the headend of a television signal distribution system is the brain of the system  the central location where the multi channel signal is initially received  converted and allocated to specific channels for analog distribution 
in some cases  where the signal is transmitted in encrypted form or digitized and compressed  the receiver will also be required to decode the signal 
blonder tongue is a licensee of motorola  inc s motorola videocipher and digicipher encryption technologies and integrates their decoders into integrated receiver decoder products  where required 
the company estimates that headend products accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  in  and in digital video headend products used by a system operator for acquisition  processing and manipulation of digital video signals 
an alternative to converting signals to analog for distribution is to transcode the satellite signal s modulation from qpsk quadrature phase shift key to qam quadrature amplitude modulation or psk to qam for hdtv signals received from a satellite transponder  since qpsk and psk are optimum for satellite transmission and qam is optimum for fiber coaxial distribution 
this maintains the signal in its digital form 
digital products continue to expand in the cable marketplace and bring more advanced technology to consumers and operators 
blonder tongue is constantly expanding its digital products offering  which includes a complete line of transcoders for economically deploying and adding a digital programming tier  including both standard and hdtv channels  to systems  digital qam up converters for data over cable applications and digital high definition television processors for delivery of hdtv programming 
high speed data products used to provide internet access and data transfer over a hybrid fiber coaxial cable system 
products in this category include standard cable modems and routers  and the megaport solution for providing broadband internet access to mdus 
the megaport solution consists of two main components  the gateway and the intelligent outlets 
the gateway is a broadband ethernet router or bridge that establishes a network within a building or community 
the intelligent outlet serves as the modem  but is permanently installed in the home to eliminate loss of equipment associated with churn 
each gateway can accommodate enabled outlets and with a software upgrade  up to outlets 
telephony products used to provide expanded telephone service to mdu subscribers 
these products are designed to offer carrier class telephone service to residences using existing twisted pair wires 
service will be fully transparent to subscribers with advanced calling features such as  caller id  call waiting plus  and three way calling available and bundled at a flat rate to subscribers 
the blonder tongue telephony family of products includes a t concentrator and a multiplexer 
the system starts at a telephone company class switch located at their local central office 
a t line is routed from the switch and brought to the loopxpress concentrator 
the telephone information is then routed to the linexpress multiplexer which converts the digital format into analog voice frequencies for transmission to up to independent resident telephone lines 
the existing twisted pair telephone wiring infrastructure is utilized to provide dial tone at a resident s premises using any standard telephone 
system operation  including activating and deactivating phone lines  is achieved through a point and click software package 
communication to the equipment can be performed locally or remotely for increased operating efficiency and simplified system management 
the company does not have a significant history of sales of telephony products as it only acquired the distribution rights in in its preferred configuration  this telephone service which is capable of deploying voip service at lower cost is a true primary line service with full capability 
the company believes that sales of those telephony products will grow into a significant source of revenue for the company 
microwave products used to transmit the output of a cable system headend to multiple locations using point to point communication links in the ghz range of frequencies 
products offered in this category are power amplifiers  repeaters  receivers  transmitters and compatible accessories 
these products convert the headend output up to the microwave band and transmit this signal using parabolic antennas 
at each receiver site  a parabolic antenna receiver combination converts the signal back to normal vhf frequencies for distribution to subscribers at the receiver site 
due to a second order on reconsideration adopted by the federal communications commission fcc in november  coupled with the availability and inherent superiority of fiber optics in linking adjacent properties in mdu applications  sales of microwave products have diminished 
while microwave products will continue to be sold to maintain existing systems  the company does not anticipate that these products will contribute significantly to the company s revenues 
fiber products used to transmit the output of a cable system headend to multiple locations using fiber optic cable 
among the products offered are optical transmitters  receivers  couplers  splitters and compatible accessories 
these products convert rf frequencies to light or infrared frequencies and launch them on optical fiber 
at each receiver site  an optical receiver is used to convert the signals back to normal vhf frequencies for distribution to subscribers 
sales of products in this category continue as they have become the product of choice in applications formerly suitable to the use of microwave products 
distribution products used to permit signals to travel from the headend to their ultimate destination in a home  apartment unit  hotel room  office or other terminal location along a distribution network of fiber optic or coaxial cable 
among the products offered by the company in this category are line extenders  broadband amplifiers  directional taps  splitters and wall taps 
in cable television systems  the distribution products are either mounted on exterior telephone poles or encased in pedestals  vaults or other security devices 
in private cable systems the distribution system is typically enclosed within the walls of the building if a single structure or added to an existing structure using various techniques to hide the coaxial cable and devices 
the non passive devices within this category are designed to ensure that the signal distributed from the headend is of sufficient strength when it arrives at its final destination to provide high quality audio video images 
the company estimates distribution products accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  in and in addressable subscriber and interdiction products used to control access to programming at the subscriber s location 
among the products offered by the company in this category are i its videomask addressable signal jammer  licensed from philips electronics north america corporation and its affiliate philips broadband networks  inc ii the smi interdiction product line acquired from scientific atlanta  inc as part of its interdiction business  and iii the addressable multi tap amt 
interdiction products limit the availability of programs to subscribers  through jamming of particular channels 
such products enable an operator or consumer to control subscriber access to premium channels and other enhanced services locally or through a computer located off premises 
they also eliminate the necessity of an operator having to make a service call to install or remove passive traps and eliminate the costs associated with damage or loss of analog set top converters in the subscribers locations 
the company believes that the reduction in operating costs  programming piracy  and converter loss which can be obtained through the use of interdiction can be a significant factor in further product penetration into the franchise cable market in mdu applications 
recently  the company introduced a consumer version of this product  the tv channel blocker  which provides local at the consumer level control of the full analog block of channels 
the customer can select which programs he or she considers objectionable to his or her children or family and locally select to block them 
while it is not possible to predict the breadth of market acceptance for these products  the company believes the potential is substantial in the private cable market  franchise cable market and consumer market as alternatives to  or in conjunction with  set top converters and as a viable option for companies and municipalities who are overbuilding existing cable infrastructures and are seeking a more consumer friendly and cost effective way to compete with the incumbent franchise cable operator 
the company estimates that interdiction products accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  in and in test products used for measuring signals in the headend and distribution 
among the products offered by the company in this category are analog and digital spectrum analyzers  qpsk analyzers  and hand held palm analyzers 
while the company expects to continue selling test products to meet the needs of customers  the company does not anticipate that these products will contribute significantly to the company s revenues 
the company will modify its products to meet specific customer requirements 
typically  these modifications are minor and do not materially alter the functionality of the products 
thus  the inability of the customer to accept such products does not generally result in the company being otherwise unable to sell such products to other customers 
research and product development the markets served by blonder tongue are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
to compete effectively in this environment  the company must engage in ongoing research and development in order to i create new products  ii expand the frequency range of existing products in order to accommodate customer demand for greater channel capacity  iii license new technology such as digital satellite receiver decoders and high speed data transmission products  and iv acquire products incorporating technology that could not otherwise be developed quickly enough using internal resources  to suit the dynamics of the evolving marketplace 
research and development projects are often initially undertaken at the request of and in an effort to address the particular needs of the company s customers and customer prospects with the expectation or promise of substantial future orders from such customers or customer prospects 
additional research and development efforts are also continuously underway for the purpose of enhancing product quality and engineering to lower production costs 
for the acquisition of new technologies  the company may rely upon technology licenses from third parties when the company believes that it can obtain such technology more quickly and or cost effectively from such third parties than the company could otherwise develop on its own  or when the desired technology is proprietary to a third party 
there were employees in the research and development department of the company at december  the company spent   and  on research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
marketing and sales blonder tongue markets and sells its products worldwide to the following markets private cable operators  system contractors  franchise cable operators  the lodging industry  institutions  satellite dealers and retailers 
sales are made directly to customers by the company s internal sales force  as well as through numerous domestic stocking distributors which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal 
these distributors serve multiple markets 
direct sales to private cable operators and system integrators accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal the company s sales and marketing function is predominantly performed by its internal sales force 
should it be deemed necessary  the company may retain independent sales representatives in particular geographic areas or targeted to specific customer prospects 
the company s internal sales force consists of employees  which currently includes salespersons salespersons in old bridge  new jersey  one salesperson in each of north myrtle beach  south carolina  cudahy  wisconsin  folsom and miami  florida and sales support personnel at the company headquarters in old bridge  new jersey 
the company s standard customer payment terms are  net days 
from time to time where the company determines that circumstances warrant  such as when a customer agrees to commit to a large blanket purchase order  the company extends payment terms beyond its standard payment terms 
the company has several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of its products 
blonder tongue participates in industry trade shows and conferences 
the company also publishes technical articles in trade and technical journals  distributes sales and product literature and has an active public relations plan to ensure complete coverage of blonder tongue s products and technology by editors of trade journals 
the company provides system design engineering for its customers  maintains extensive ongoing communications with many original equipment manufacturer customers and provides one on one demonstrations and technical seminars to potential new customers 
blonder tongue supplies sales and applications support  product literature and training to its sales representatives and distributors 
the management of the company travels extensively  identifying customer needs and meeting potential customers 
the company had approximately  in purchase orders as of december  and approximately  in purchase orders as of december  all of the purchase orders outstanding as of december  are expected to be shipped prior to december  the purchase orders are for the future delivery of products and are subject to cancellation by the customers 
customers blonder tongue has a broad customer base  which in consisted of approximately active accounts 
approximately   and of the company s revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively  were derived from sales of products to the company s five largest customers 
in and  sales to toner cable equipment  inc accounted for approximately and respectively of the company s revenues 
there can be no assurance that any sales to these entities  individually or as a group  will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
however  the company anticipates that these customers will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues in future periods  although none of them is obligated to purchase any specified amount of products or to provide the company with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
the complement of leading customers may shift as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others 
the company believes that many integrators will grow rapidly  and as such the company s success will depend in part on the viability of those customers and on the company s ability to maintain its position in the overall marketplace by shifting its emphasis to those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of the company s leading customers  the financial failure of any of these entities  or the company s inability to develop and maintain solid relationships with the integrators which may replace the present leading customers  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from customers in the continental united states  however  the company also derives revenues from customers outside the continental united states  primarily in canada and to a more limited extent  in underdeveloped countries 
television service is less developed in many international markets  particularly latin america and asia  creating opportunity for those participants who offer quality products at a competitive price 
sales to customers outside of the united states represented approximately  and of the company s revenues in fiscal years  and respectively 
all of the company s transactions with customers located outside of the continental united states are denominated in us dollars  therefore  the company has no material foreign currency transactions 
manufacturing and suppliers blonder tongue s manufacturing operations are located at the company s headquarters in old bridge  new jersey 
the company s manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and consist principally of the assembly and testing of electronic assemblies built from fabricated parts  printed circuit boards and electronic devices and the fabrication from raw sheet metal of chassis and cabinets for such assemblies 
management continues to implement a significant number of changes to the manufacturing process to increase production volume and reduce product cost  including logistics modifications on the factory floor  an increased use of surface mount  axial lead and radial lead robotics to place electronic components on printed circuit boards  a continuing program of circuit board redesign to make more products compatible with robotic insertion equipment and an increased integration in machining and fabrication 
all of these efforts are consistent with and part of the company s strategy to provide its customers with high performance to cost ratio products 
outside contractors supply standard components  etch printed circuit boards and electronic subassemblies to the company s specifications 
while the company generally purchases electronic parts which do not have a unique source  certain electronic component parts used within the company s products are available from a limited number of suppliers and can be subject to temporary shortages because of general economic conditions and the demand and supply for such component parts 
if the company were to experience a temporary shortage of any given electronic part  the company believes that alternative parts could be obtained or system design changes implemented 
however  in such situations the company may experience temporary reductions in its ability to ship products affected by the component shortage 
on an as needed basis  the company purchases several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available  such as the videocipher and digicipher encryption systems manufactured by motorola  which are standard encryption methodologies employed on us c band and ku band transponders  echostar digital receivers for delivery of dish network programming  and hughes digital satellite receivers for delivery of directv programming 
an inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of these components could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company does not have an agreement with any sole source supplier requiring the supplier to sell a specified volume of components to the company 
blonder tongue maintains a quality assurance program which tests samples of component parts purchased  as well as its finished products  on an ongoing basis and also conducts tests throughout the manufacturing process using commercially available and in house built testing systems that incorporate proprietary procedures 
blonder tongue performs final product tests on of its products prior to shipment to customers 
competition all aspects of the company s business are highly competitive 
the company competes with national  regional and local manufacturers and distributors  including companies larger than blonder tongue which have substantially greater resources 
various manufacturers who are suppliers to the company sell directly as well as through distributors into the franchise and private cable marketplaces 
because of the convergence of the cable  telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by the company 
many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than blonder tongue 
the company expects that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional competition could result in price reductions  loss of market share and delays in the timing of customer orders 
the principal methods of competition are product differentiation  performance and quality  price and terms  service  and technical and administrative support 
intellectual property the company currently holds united states patents and foreign patents covering a wide range of electronic systems and circuits  of which united states patents and foreign patents were obtained in the company s acquisition of scientific atlanta  inc s interdiction business during other than certain of the patents acquired from scientific atlanta  inc  none of the company s patents are considered material to the company s present operations because they do not relate to high volume applications 
because of the rapidly evolving nature of the cable television industry  the company believes that its market position as a supplier to cable integrators derives primarily from its ability to develop a continuous stream of new products which are designed to meet its customers needs and which have a high performance to cost ratio 
the company has a registered trademark on blonder tongue and also on a bt logo 
in connection with the transactions pursuant to which the company acquired an ownership interest in netlinc and blonder tongue telephone  the company granted blonder tongue telephone a non exclusive  revocable and royalty free license to use these trademarks and certain variations of such names 
the company is a licensee of philips electronics north america corporation and its affiliate philips broadband networks  inc  motorola  hughes and several smaller software development companies 
under the philips license agreements  the company is granted a non exclusive license for a term which expires in  concurrently with the last to expire of the relevant patents 
the philips license agreements provide for the payment by the company of a one time license fee and for the payment by the company of royalties based upon unit sales of licensed products 
the company is a licensee of motorola relating to motorola s videocipher encryption technology and is also a party to a private label agreement with motorola relating to its digicipher technology 
under the videocipher license agreement  the company is granted a non exclusive license under certain proprietary know how  to design and manufacture certain licensed products to be compatible with the videocipher commercial descrambler module 
the videocipher license agreement provides for the payment by the company of a one time license fee for the company s first model of licensed product and additional one time license fees for each additional model of licensed product 
the videocipher license agreement also provides for the payment by the company of royalties based upon unit sales of licensed products 
under the digicipher private label agreement  the company is granted the non exclusive right to sell digicipher ii integrated receiver decoders bearing the blonder tongue name for use in the commercial market 
the digicipher private label agreement provides for the payment by the company of a one time license fee for the company s first model of licensed product and additional one time license fees for each additional model of licensed product 
during  the company entered into several software development and license agreements for specifically designed controller and interface software necessary for the operation of the company s video central remote interdiction control system  which is used for remote operation of videomask signal jammers installed at subscriber locations 
these licenses are perpetual and require the payment of a one time license fee and in one case additional payments  the aggregate of which are not material 
the company relies on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technologies and know how 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technologies and know how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technologies and know how independently 
therefore  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop products that are competitive with the company s products and such competition could adversely affect the prices for the company s products or the company s market share 
the company also believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining its competitive position 
regulation private cable  while in some cases subject to certain fcc licensing requirements  is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations 
franchise cable operators had been subject to extensive government regulation pursuant to the cable television consumer protection and competition act of  which among other things provided for rate rollbacks for basic tier cable service  further rate reductions under certain circumstances and limitations on future rate increases 
the telecommunications act of deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries 
in june   the fcc adopted and issued a final rule and order relating to the re designation of portions of the ghz frequency band among the various currently allocated services 
the final rules regarding this issue provided for the grandfathering  for a period of ten years  of certain pre existing installed terrestrial fixed service operators tfsos and tfsos that had made application for a license prior to a certain date 
the fcc segmented the ghz frequency band into several sub bands and provided for varying obligations and rights as between the tfsos and fixed satellite service operators fssos 
overall  the final rules were complex and placed a measure of uncertainty upon tfsos considering the use of microwave gear in new systems 
in november  the fcc issued a second order on reconsideration the second order  which redefined the use of the ghz microwave band 
among other things  the second order changed the permissible band of transmission for future microwave links from the to ghz band to the ghz to ghz band 
as a result of the second order  the company s existing microwave inventory would have to be modified to function within the new frequency band 
the new ghz band provides additional channel capacity to the private cable operator 
in addition  on april   the fcc international bureau released a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm  docket  which among other things  proposes channelization changes for the ghz band 
through this nprm  the fcc international bureau is seeking to reduce the useable band from ghz to ghz 
this proposed change  if adopted  would reduce ghz channel capacity for private cable operator use 
the impact on future ghz sales remains uncertain at this time 
these issues  coupled with the expanding use of fiber optic cable and the inherent superiority in fiber due to its greater bandwidth capability  have resulted in a shift in customer purchases away from microwave gear and toward fiber optics

overview the company was incorporated in november   under the laws of delaware as gps acquisition corp 
for the purpose of acquiring the business of blonder tongue laboratories  inc  a new jersey corporation which was founded in by ben h 
tongue and isaac s 
blonder to design  manufacture and supply a line of electronics and systems equipment principally for the private cable industry 
following the acquisition  the company changed its name to blonder tongue laboratories  inc the company completed the initial public offering of its shares of common stock in december  the company is principally a designer  manufacturer and supplier of a comprehensive line of electronics and systems equipment  primarily for the cable television industry both franchise and private cable 
over the past few years  the company has also introduced equipment and innovative solutions for the high speed transmission of data and the provision of telephony services in multiple dwelling unit applications 
the company s products are used to acquire  distribute and protect the broad range of communications signals carried on fiber optic  twisted pair  coaxial cable and wireless distribution systems 
these products are sold to customers providing an array of communications services  including television  high speed data internet and telephony  to single family dwellings  multiple dwelling units mdus  the lodging industry and institutions such as hospitals  prisons  schools and marinas 
the company s principal customers are cable system integrators both franchise and private cable operators  as well as contractors that design  package  install and in most instances operate  upgrade and maintain the systems they build 
the company s success is due in part to management s efforts to leverage the company s reputation by broadening its product line to offer one stop shop convenience to private cable and franchise cable system integrators and to deliver products having a high performance to cost ratio 
the company continues to expand its core product lines headend and distribution  to maintain its ability to provide all of the electronic equipment needed to build small cable systems and much of the equipment needed in larger systems for the most efficient operation and highest profitability in high density applications 
in march   the company acquired all of the assets and technology rights  including the smi interdiction product line  of the interdiction business the interdiction business of scientific atlanta  inc scientific 
the company is utilizing the smi interdiction product line acquired from scientific  which has been engineered primarily to serve the franchise cable market  as a supplement to the company s videomask interdiction products  which are primarily focused on the private cable market 
over the past several years  the company has expanded beyond its core business by acquiring a private cable television system bdr broadband  llc and by acquiring an interest in a company offering a private telephone program ideally suited to multiple dwelling unit applications blonder tongue telephone  llc 
these acquisitions are described in more detail below 
during june   the company formed a venture with priority systems  llc and paradigm capital investments  llc for the purpose of acquiring the rights of entry for certain multiple dwelling unit cable television systems the systems owned by affiliates of verizon communications  inc the venture entity  bdr broadband  of the outstanding capital stock of which is owned by the company  acquired the systems  which are currently comprised of approximately  existing mdu cable television subscribers and approximately  passings 
bdr broadband paid approximately  for the systems  subject to adjustment  which constitutes a purchase price of per subscriber 
the final closing date for the transaction was on october  the systems were cash flow positive beginning in the first year 
to date  the systems have been upgraded with approximately  of interdiction and other products of the company  and during  two systems located outside the region where the remaining systems are located  were sold 
it is planned that the systems will be upgraded with approximately  of additional interdiction and other products of the company over the course of operation 
during july   the company purchased the interest in bdr broadband that had been originally owned by paradigm capital investments  llc  for an aggregate purchase price of  resulting in an increase in the company s stake in bdr broadband from to 
in consideration for its majority interest in bdr broadband  the company advanced to bdr broadband  which was paid to the sellers as a down payment against the final purchase price for the systems 
the company also agreed to guaranty payment of the aggregate purchase price for the systems by bdr broadband 
the approximately  balance of the purchase price was paid by the company on behalf of bdr broadband on november   pursuant to the terms and in satisfaction of certain promissory notes the seller notes executed by bdr broadband in favor of the sellers 
the company believes that the model it devised for acquiring and operating the systems has been successful and can be replicated for other transactions 
the company also believes that opportunities currently exist to acquire additional rights of entry for multiple dwelling unit cable television  high speed data and or telephony systems 
the company is seeking and is presently negotiating several such opportunities  although there is no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating these transactions 
in addition  the company may need financing to acquire additional the rights of entry  and financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
in march   the company entered into a series of agreements  pursuant to which the company acquired a minority interest in netlinc communications  llc netlinc and a minority interest in blonder tongue telephone  llc btt to which the company has licensed its name 
the aggregate purchase price consisted of i up to  payable over a minimum of two years  plus ii  shares of the company s common stock 
netlinc owns patents  proprietary technology and know how for certain telephony products that allow competitive local exchange carriers clecs to competitively provide voice service to mdus 
certain distributorship agreements were also concurrently entered into among netlinc  btt and the company pursuant to which the company ultimately acquired the right to distribute netlinc s telephony products to private and franchise cable operators as well as to all buyers for use in mdu applications 
btt partners with clecs to offer primary voice service to mdus  receiving a portion of the line charges due from the clecs telephone customers  and the company offers for sale a line of telephony equipment to complement the voice service 
as a result of netlinc s inability to retain a contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply the products in a timely and consistent manner in accordance with the requisite specifications  in september  the parties agreed to restructure the terms of their business arrangement entered into in march  the restructured business arrangement was accomplished by amending certain of the agreements previously entered into and entering into certain new agreements 
some of the principal terms of the restructured arrangement include increasing the company s economic ownership in netlinc from to and in btt from to  all at no additional cost to the company 
the cash portion of the purchase price in the venture was decreased from  to  and the then outstanding balance of  was paid in installments of  per week until it was paid in full in october  in addition  of the  shares of common stock issued to btt as the non cash component of the purchase price fair valued at  one half  shares have been pledged to the company as collateral to secure btt s obligation to repay the  cash component of the purchase price to the company via preferential distributions of cash flow under btt s limited liability company operating agreement 
under the restructured arrangement  the company can purchase similar telephony products directly from third party suppliers other than netlinc and  in connection therewith  the company would pay certain future royalties to netlinc and btt from the sale of these products by the company 
while the distributorship agreements among netlinc  btt and the company have not been terminated  the company does not anticipate purchasing products from netlinc in the near term 
netlinc  however  continues to own intellectual property  which may be further developed and used in the future to manufacture and sell telephony products under the distributorship agreements 
in addition to receiving incremental revenues associated with its direct sales of the telephony products  the company also anticipates receiving additional revenues from telephony services provided by or through contracts for such services obtained by bdr broadband  btt through the company s stake therein as well as through joint ventures with third parties 
while the events related to the restructuring resulted in a delay in the company s anticipated revenue stream from the sale of telephony products  the company believes that these revised terms are beneficial and will result in the company enjoying higher gross margins on telephony equipment unit sales as well as an incrementally higher proportion of telephony service revenues 
it has been the company s experience during the past year that the time frame from introduction of a telephony service opportunity to consummation of the associated right of entry agreement  is longer than the time frame relating to obtaining rights of entry for the provision of video and high speed data services 
this protracted time frame has had an adverse impact on the growth of telephony system revenues 
material incremental revenues associated with the sale of telephony products are not presently anticipated to be received until at least the third quarter of restatement subsequent to the company s issuance of its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   the company determined that a vendor s account payable balance was incorrectly recorded in and due to certain inventories that were received from the vendor and not correctly recorded 
these incorrect entries resulted in accounts payable being understated in and  cost of goods sold being understated in and  net income being overstated in and net loss being understated in and the company restated its consolidated financial statements for each of the three years ended december  to reflect the correction of the vendor s account payable balance and the related impact to costs of good sold 
in addition  as reported in the company s form q for the quarter ended june   the company reclassified certain inventory not anticipated to be sold in the succeeding twelve months as non current and reflected such reclassification on the december  balance sheet 
the restatement also reflects this reclassification of certain inventory as non current 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the reclassification and restatement 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal periods indicated  certain consolidated statement of earnings data as a percentage of net sales 
the company believes that the product sales in will be slightly better than in  with increases in the telephony and high speed data product lines accounting for most of the growth 
gross margin  although impossible to predict due to the dependence on product mix  is expected to remain relatively constant

compared with net sales 
net sales decreased  or to  in from  in the decrease is attributed to a decrease in capital spending by cable system operators and weak overall economic conditions 
the decrease in capital spending by cable system operators was  in part  the result of the bankruptcy of wsnet  which had been a leading provider of programming to the private cable industry

legal title and risk of loss with respect to the products pass to customers at the point of shipment 
customers do not have a right to return products shipped 
products carry a three year warranty  which amount is not material to the company s operations

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts management periodically performs a detailed review of amounts due from customers to determine if accounts receivable balances are impaired based on factors affecting the collectibility of those balances 
management s estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of collection losses  which affects the allowances and net income 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management assumptions  these allowances may need to be adjusted in the future 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s long lived assets may be impaired 
an asset s value may be impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
if impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the long lived asset 
the company s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each long lived asset are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties

risk factors the company s business operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following risk factors highlights some of these risks 
additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company now deems immaterial may also affect the company and the value of its common stock 
dependence on certain large customers approximately  and of the company s revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively  were derived from sales of products to the company s five largest customers 
in  and  sales to toner cable equipment  inc accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
there can be no assurance that any sales to these customers  individually or as a group  will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
however  the company anticipates that these customers will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues in future periods  although none of them is obligated to purchase any specified amount of products beyond outstanding purchase orders or to provide the company with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
the complement of leading customers may shift as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others 
the company believes that many integrators will grow rapidly  and  as such  the company s success will depend in part on the viability of those customers and on the company s ability to maintain its position in the overall marketplace by shifting its emphasis to those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of the company s leading customers  the financial failure of any of these entities  or the company s inability to develop solid relationships with the integrators which may replace the present leading customers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on inventory liquidation the company continually analyzes its slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories 
based on historical and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices  the company establishes reserves 
if the company does not meet its sales expectations  these reserves are increased 
products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value 
the company recorded an increase to its reserve of   and  during  and  respectively 
although the company believes reserves are adequate and inventories are reflected at net realizable value  there can be no assurance that the company will not have to record additional inventory reserves in the future 
significant increases to inventory reserves could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
changes in technologies  industry standards and customers needs both the private cable and franchised cable industries are characterized by the continuing advancement of technology  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
to be successful  the company must anticipate the evolution of industry standards and changes in customer needs  through the timely development and introduction of new products  enhancement of existing products and licensing of new technology from third parties 
although the company depends primarily on its own research and development efforts to develop new products and enhancements to its existing products  the company has and may continue to seek licenses for new technology from third parties when the company believes that it can obtain such technology more quickly and or cost effectively from such third parties than the company could otherwise develop on its own  or when the desired technology has already been patented by a third party 
there can  however  be no assurance that new technology or such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will anticipate the evolution of industry standards in the cable television or the communications industry generally  changes in the market and customer needs  or that technologies and applications under development by the company will be successfully developed  or if they are successfully developed  that they will achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce products and applications or to obtain licenses for new technologies from third parties in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
highly competitive market place all aspects of the company s business are highly competitive 
the company competes with national  regional and local manufacturers and distributors  including companies larger than itself  which have substantially greater resources 
various manufacturers who are suppliers to the company sell directly as well as through distributors into the cable television marketplace 
because of the convergence of the cable  telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by the company 
many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than the company 
the company expects that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
additional competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition through price reductions  loss of market share and delays in the timing of customer orders and an inability to increase its penetration into the cable television market 
dependence on cable industry capital spending the company estimates that approximately  and of its revenues in fiscal years  and came from worldwide sales of its products for use primarily in private cable systems 
demand for the company s products depends to a large extent upon capital spending on private cable systems and specifically by private cable operators for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining or upgrading their systems 
capital spending by private cable operators and  therefore  the company s sales and profitability  are dependent on a variety of factors  including access by private cable operators to financing  demand for their cable services  availability of alternative video delivery technologies  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the company s sales and profitability may in the future be more dependent on capital spending by traditional franchise cable system operators as well as by new entrants to this market planning to over build existing cable system infrastructures  or constructing  rebuilding  maintaining and upgrading their systems 
there can be no assurance that system operators in private cable or franchise cable will continue capital spending for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining  or upgrading their systems 
any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by private cable or franchise cable operators would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on single manufacturing facility the company operates out of one manufacturing facility in old bridge  new jersey the old bridge facility 
while the company maintains a limited amount of business interruption insurance  a casualty that results in a lengthy interruption of the ability to manufacture at that facility would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on third party suppliers the company purchases several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available  such as the videocipher and digicipher encryption systems manufactured by general instrument corporation  which are standard encryption methodology employed on united states c band and ku band transponders  certain components of echostar s digital satellite receiver decoders  which are specifically designed to work with the dish network  and certain components of hughes network systems digital satellite receivers which are specifically designed to work with directv programming 
an inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of these components could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by receipt of a significant number of defective components  an increase in component prices or the inability of the company to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive pressures on the pricing of the company s products 
risks of international operations sales to customers outside of the united states represented approximately  and of the company s revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
such sales are subject to certain risks such as changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  other trade barriers  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause the company s products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
there can be no assurance that sales to customers outside the united states will reach or exceed historical levels in the future  or that international markets will continue to develop or that the company will receive additional contracts to supply its products for use in systems and equipment in international markets 
the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if international markets do not continue to develop  the company does not continue to receive additional contracts to supply its products for use in systems and equipment in international markets or the company s international sales are affected by the other risks of international operations 
limited proprietary protection other than the smi interdiction product line acquired by the company from scientific atlanta  inc  the underlying technology for which is covered by numerous us and international patents  the company possesses limited patent or registered intellectual property rights with respect to its technology 
the company relies on a combination of contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technology and know how 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technology and know how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
therefore  existing and potential competitors may be able to develop similar products which compete with the company s products 
such competition could adversely affect the prices for the company s products or the company s market share and could have a material adverse effect upon the company s results of operations and financial condition 
risk of patent infringement claims while the company does not believe that its products including products and technologies licensed from others infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted against the company or its customers 
damages for violation of third party proprietary rights could be substantial  in some instances are trebled  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
regardless of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims  the company would incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
if the company is unsuccessful in defending any claims or actions that are asserted against the company or its customers  the company may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that under such circumstances  a license would be available under reasonable terms or at all 
the failure to obtain a license to a third party s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
risks of governmental regulation the private cable industry estimated by the company to represent approximately of its business  while in some cases subject to certain fcc licensing requirements  is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations 
it is possible  however  that regulations could be adopted in the future which impose burdensome restrictions on private cable operators resulting in  among other things  barriers to the entry of new competitors or limitations on capital expenditures by private cable operators 
any such regulations  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
operators in the franchise cable market estimated by the company to represent approximately of its business had been subject to extensive government regulation pursuant to the cable television consumer protection and competition act of  which among other things provided for rate rollbacks for basic tier cable service  further rate reductions under certain circumstances and limitations on future rate increases 
the telecommunications act of has deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and has opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries 
it is possible  however  that regulations could be adopted which would re impose burdensome restrictions on franchise cable operators resulting in  among other things  the grant of exclusive rights or franchises within certain geographical areas 
in addition  certain rules adopted by the fcc in june  as further revised in and provide for the re designation of portions of the ghz frequency band among the various currently allocated services  which rules have shifted demand away from the company s microwave gear 
any increased regulation of franchise cable could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
environmental regulations the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes 
the company does not anticipate material capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended for compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on the company 
further  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its operations 
any failure by the company to obtain required permits for  control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject the company to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
such liability or suspension of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key executives and technical and management personnel  including james a 
luksch  chief executive officer  and robert j 
pall  president and chief operating officer 
the company maintains and is the beneficiary of  of key man life insurance on each of mr 
luksch and mr 
pall 
the company s future success also depends on its ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled engineering  manufacturing  marketing and managerial personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees  in particular the principal members of its management and technical staff  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
potential issuance of preferred stock and other anti takeover measures the board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock  to determine the powers  preferences and rights and the qualifications  limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed upon any unissued series of undesignated preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series  without any further vote or action by the company s stockholders 
the preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to the rights of the common stock 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance of such stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
in addition  the company s restated certificate of incorporation eliminates the right of stockholders to act without a meeting  does not provide cumulative voting for the election of directors or the right of stockholders to call special meetings  provides for a classified board of directors  and imposes various procedural requirements which could make it difficult for such stockholders to affect certain corporate actions 
these provisions and the board s ability to issue preferred stock may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or offers from third parties to acquire the company  preventing stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of the company s common stock  or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company 
the company is also afforded the protection of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could delay or prevent a change in control of the company  impede a merger  consolidation or other business combination involving the company or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company 
any of these provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the company s common stock 
dividends unlikely the company intends to retain its earnings to finance the growth of its business and therefore does not intend to pay dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future 
moreover  the company s loan agreement with commerce bank  na prohibits the payment of cash dividends by the company on its common stock 
potential volatility of stock price factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company  its competitors or third parties  quarterly variations in the company s actual or anticipated results of operations  failure of revenues or earnings in any quarter to meet the investment community s expectations  and market conditions for emerging growth stocks or cable industry stocks in general may cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate significantly 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to the company s performance 
these fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
risk of labor negotiations all of the company s direct labor employees are members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers union  local  under a collective bargaining agreement  which expires in february delays or difficulties in negotiating and executing a new agreement  which may result in work stoppages  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition
