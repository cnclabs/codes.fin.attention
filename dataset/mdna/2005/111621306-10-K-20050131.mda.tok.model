item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of consolidated financial statements on january   brocade announced that its audit committee completed its previously announced internal review 
as a result of certain findings of the review  brocade determined that certain of its historical financial statements required restatement 
specifically  brocade determined that the restatement was required because it incorrectly accounted for a grants that were made to new hires on their offer acceptance date  rather than the date of their commencement of employment  during the period may to july  b grants that were made to persons engaged on a part time basis prior to their new hire full time employment during the period august to october  and c grants where there was insufficient basis to rely on brocade s process and related documentation to support recorded measurement dates used to account for certain stock options granted prior to august therefore  brocade recorded additional stock based compensation charges relating to many of its stock option grants made during the period through the third quarter of fiscal year in addition  brocade recorded a valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets related to previously recorded stock option tax benefits 
these charges affected the previously filed financial statements for fiscal years ended october  and october   including the corresponding interim periods for fiscal years and  and the interim periods ended january   may  and july  brocade also recorded stock based compensation and associated income tax adjustments to previously announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended october  these adjustments relate solely to matters pertaining to stock options granted prior to august the foregoing restatement adjustments did not affect our reported cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance as of october  and october  results of operations our fiscal year is the or weeks ending on the last saturday in october

revenues 
our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our silkworm family of products 
our silkworm products  which range in size from ports to ports  connect servers and storage devices creating a san 
net revenues for the year ended october  were million  an increase of percent compared with net revenues of million for the year ended october  for the year ended october   the increase in net revenues reflected a percent increase in the number of ports shipped  partially offset by a percent decline in average selling price per port 
net revenues for the year ended october  represented a decrease of percent compared with net revenues of million for the year ended october  for the year ended october   the decrease in net revenues reflected a percent increase in the number of ports shipped  offset by a percent decline in average selling price per port 
the declines in average selling prices are the result of increased competition 
we believe the increase in the number of ports shipped reflects higher demand for our products as end users continue to consolidate storage and servers infrastructures using sans  expand sans to support more applications  and deploy sans in new environments 
we also believe some of the increase in ports shipped reflects the initial stocking of new products by our oem customers 
we expect the number of ports shipped to fluctuate depending on the demand for our existing and recently introduced products as well as the timing of product transitions by our oem customers 
we also expect that average selling price per port will likely decline at rates consistent with the rates we experienced in 
table of contents the year ended october   unless they are adversely affected by accelerated pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or other factors that may be beyond our control 
historically  domestic revenues have been between percent and percent of total revenues 
domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively  for the year ended october  for the year ended october   domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively  and for the year ended october   domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively 
revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer to which our products are shipped 
international revenues primarily consist of sales to customers in western europe and the greater asia pacific region 
for the years ended october  and october   international revenues have increased primarily as a result of faster growth in the asia pacific region relative to north america and europe 
however  certain oem customers take possession of our products domestically and then distribute these products to their international customers 
because we account for all of those oem revenues as domestic revenues  we cannot be certain of the extent to which our domestic and international revenue mix is impacted by the practices of our oem customers 
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a relatively small number of oem customers 
for the year ended october   three customers  emc  hp and ibm  each represented greater than ten percent of our total revenues for a combined total of percent of our total revenues 
for the years ended october  and october   the same three customers each represented greater than ten percent of our total revenues for combined totals of percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to come from sales of products to a relatively small number of oem customers 
therefore  the loss of  or a decrease in the level of sales to  or a change in the ordering pattern of  any one of these customers could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended october  was percent compared to percent and percent for the years ended october  and october   respectively 
cost of goods sold consists of product costs  which are variable  and manufacturing operations costs  which are generally fixed 
for the year ended october   product costs relative to net revenues decreased by as compared to the year ended october  due to decreases in component and manufacturing costs 
manufacturing operations costs relative to net revenues decreased by principally due to increases in net revenues and savings from the restructuring programs we implemented during the second quarter of fiscal year see note  restructuring costs  of the notes to consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
in addition  gross margin decreased by due to higher stock compensation expense in the year ended october  primarily as a result of changes in the market value of common stock see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
for the year ended october   the reduction in gross margins was principally the result of increased product costs and manufacturing operations costs relative to net revenues 
in addition  gross margin was further decreased by due to stock compensation expense adjustment in the year ended october  as a result of changes in the market value of common stock and additional stock options granted for the period see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
the increase in product costs relative to net revenues was primarily the result of declines in average unit selling prices of our products  partially offset by lower component and manufacturing costs 
the increase in manufacturing operations costs was a result of increased production volume and a greater installed base  combined with the costs associated with the migration of manufacturing operations to asia 
gross margin is primarily affected by average selling price per port  number of ports shipped  and cost of goods sold 
we expect that average selling price per port for our products will continue to decline at rates consistent with the rates we experienced in the year ended october   unless they are further affected by accelerated pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or other factors that may be beyond our control 
we believe that we have the ability to partially mitigate the effect of declines in average selling price per port on gross margins through our product and manufacturing operations cost reductions 

table of contents during fiscal year  the average selling price per port began to decline at a faster pace than we experienced in fiscal year if this dynamic reoccurs  we may not be able to reduce our costs fast enough to prevent a decline in our gross margins 
in addition  we must also maintain or increase current volume of ports shipped to maintain our current gross margins 
if we are unable to offset future reductions of average selling price per port with reductions in product and manufacturing operations costs  or if as a result of future reductions in average selling price per port our revenues do not grow  our gross margins would be negatively affected 
we recently introduced several new products and expect to introduce additional new products in the future 
as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories  and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands 
our gross margins may be adversely affected if we fail to successfully manage the introductions of these new products 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in engineering and r d activities  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  nonrecurring engineering charges  prototyping expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products  depreciation related to engineering and test equipment  and it and facilities expenses 
for the year ended october   r d expenses increased by million  or three percent  to million  compared with million for the year ended october  this increase is primarily due to million increase in expenses related to consulting and new product development spending  including costs associated with new silkworm products we introduced during the second half of fiscal year  offset by a million decrease in salaries and related expenses and a million decrease in facilities expenses due to savings from our building purchase 
the decrease in salaries and related expenses reflects the effects of our recent restructuring programs  partially offset by incremental expenses related to the extra week in the second quarter of fiscal year in addition  r d expenses increased by million due to higher stock compensation expense in the year ended october  primarily as a result of changes in the market value of common stock see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
for the year ended october   r d expenses increased by million  or percent  compared with million for the year ended october  r d expenses increased by million due to changes in stock compensation expense primarily as a result of changes in the market value of common stock and additional stock options granted for the period see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
in addition  the increase in r d expense is also due to continued investment in research and development associated with new products introduced in fiscal year as well as the incremental spending associated with product development related to our acquisition of rhapsody 
excluding any stock option compensation related charges  which will vary depending on the changes in the market value of our common stock  we currently anticipate that r d expenses in fiscal year will remain consistent with fiscal year in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales  costs associated with promotional and travel expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
for the year ended october   sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or percent  to million  compared with million for the year ended october  this decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in travel and marketing program expenses resulting from various cost cutting actions and a million decrease in salaries and related expenses  which reflects the effect of headcount reductions that occurred in the fiscal years and  partially offset by incremental expenses related to the extra week in the second quarter of fiscal year in addition  sales and marketing expenses increased by million due to higher stock compensation expense in the year ended october  
table of contents primarily as a result of changes in the market value of common stock see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
for the year ended october   sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or seven percent  compared with million for the year ended october  sales and marketing expenses increased by million due to changes in stock compensation expense primarily as a result of changes in the market value of common stock and additional stock options granted for the period see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
in addition  the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due to increased salaries and related expenses  offset by decreased commissions and decreased travel and marketing program expenses resulting from various cost cutting actions 
excluding any stock option compensation related charges  which will vary depending on the changes in the market value of our common stock  we currently anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in fiscal year will decrease in absolute dollars as a result of savings related to the restructuring program we undertook in fiscal year general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for corporate executives  finance  human resources and investor relations  as well as recruiting expenses  professional fees  corporate legal expenses  other corporate expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
g a expenses for the year ended october  increased by million  or percent  to million  compared with million for the year ended october  for the year ended october   g a expenses increased by million  or percent  compared with million for the year ended october  the increase in g a for both fiscal years and is primarily due to increased salaries and related expenses as a result of an increase in personnel 
in addition  in fiscal year we incurred incremental expenses related to the extra week in the second quarter of fiscal year  as well as expenses related to the section of the sarbanes oxley act of further  for the year ended october  g a expenses increased by million due to higher stock compensation expense in the year ended october  primarily as a result of changes in the market value of common stock see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
for the year ended october  g a expenses increased by million due to changes in stock compensation expense primarily as a result of changes in the market value of common stock and additional stock options granted for the period see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
excluding any stock option compensation related charges  which will vary depending on the changes in the market value of our common stock  we currently anticipate that g a expenses in fiscal year will increase in absolute dollars resulting from the cost related to our recent internal review  as described above  and expenses associated with the sarbanes oxley section compliance 
settlement of an acquisition related claim 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million charge in settlement of a claim relating to our acquisition of rhapsody 
under the terms of the settlement  in the third quarter of fiscal year we issued million shares of common stock to the former rhapsody shareholders in exchange for a release of claims 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased to million for the year ended october   compared with million  and million for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of deferred stock compensation in connection with our acquisition of rhapsody 
the million of deferred stock compensation represented the intrinsic value of unvested restricted common stock and stock options assumed in the transaction  and is being amortized over the respective remaining service periods on a straight line basis see note  acquisition of rhapsody networks  inc  of the notes to consolidated 
table of contents financial statements 
as of october   the remaining unamortized balance of this deferred stock compensation was million 
in addition to the deferred stock compensation connected with our acquisition of rhapsody  we have recorded deferred stock compensation arising from stock option grants subject to variable accounting and restricted stock award grants to certain employees 
compensation expense resulting from these non acquisition related grants are included in r d  sales and marketing  or g a  based on the department of the employee receiving the award 
accordingly  amortization of deferred stock compensation does not include the compensation expense arising from these awards 
total stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended october   and october  was million and million  respectively 
for the year ended october   we recognized a million net reversal of previously recognized stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options subject to variable accounting will vary significantly as a result of future changes in the market value of our common stock 
the increase in stock based compensation during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to an increase in the market value of our common stock during fiscal year the increase in stock based compensation during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to a smaller decline in the market value of our common stock during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year restructuring costs 
restructuring costs for the years ended october   october   and october  were million  million  and none  respectively 
for the year ended october   restructuring costs consist of million related to a restructuring plan implemented during the three months ended may   and a reduction of million to restructuring costs related to our previously recorded restructuring liabilities  primarily due to lower than expected costs related to outplacement costs and severance see note  restructuring costs  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of this restructuring  we expect to realize savings in future quarters as a result of changes in headcount and business structure 
for the year ended october   restructuring costs consisted of million related to a program to restructure and reorganize certain business operations during the three months ended april   and million related to a company wide restructuring program implemented during the three months ended january  in process research and development 
on january   we completed our acquisition of rhapsody  a provider of next generation intelligent switching platforms 
as of the acquisition date  rhapsody was a development stage company that had no recognized revenue and a core technology that required substantial additional resources to bring it to technological feasibility 
therefore  we accounted for the acquisition as an asset purchase and allocated the total purchase price of million to the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and acquired in process r d based on their respective fair values 
we allocated the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets received to acquired in process r d and acquired non monetary assets on a pro rata basis 
we expensed the acquired in process r d of million during the three months ended april  because it had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note  acquisition of rhapsody networks  inc  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we did not record any acquired in process r d in any of the other periods presented 
we completed the development of this technology in fiscal year lease termination charge and other  net 
lease termination charge and other  net for the year ended october  was million 
during the three months ended january   we purchased a previously leased building located near our san jose headquarters for million 
of the million  million was allocated to the purchase of land and building and million was considered a lease termination fee see note  liabilities associated with facilities lease losses and asset impairment charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
no lease termination charge was recorded in any of the other periods presented 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net increased slightly to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october   primarily as a result of higher average rates of return due to investment mix and increase in interest rates  offset by decreased average 
table of contents cash  cash equivalent and investment balances 
net interest and other income was million for the year ended october   million higher than in the year ended october  the decrease in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily the result of declining interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended october   october  and october   respectively 
interest expense primarily represents the interest cost associated with our convertible subordinated debt 
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended october   compared with the year ended october  was primarily the result of the repurchases of our convertible subordinated debt  resulting in a lower debt outstanding as of october  the increase in interest expense for the year ended october   compared with the year ended october   was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of interest expense related to our convertible subordinated debt during fiscal year  partially offset by reduction of interest expense due to repurchases of convertible subordinated debt 
for the year ended october   interest expense related to our convertible subordinated debt  which was outstanding for ten months during the period 
as of october  and october   the outstanding balance of our convertible subordinated debt was million and million  respectively see note  convertible subordinated debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain on repurchases of convertible subordinated debt 
during the years ended october  and october   we repurchased million and million in face value of our convertible subordinated debt  respectively  on the open market 
for the year ended october   we paid an average of for each dollar of face value for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
for the year ended october   we paid an average of for each dollar of face value for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
we did not repurchase any of our convertible subordinated debt during the year ended october  see note  convertible subordinated debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain loss on investments  net 
for the year ended october   net gain on investments was million consisting of gains on the disposition of previously written down non marketable private strategic investments 
for the year ended october   net gain on investments of million consisting of gains on the disposition of previously written down non marketable private strategic investments of million  offset by an impairment charge of million that resulted from an other than temporary decline in the estimated fair value of a minority equity investment in a different non publicly traded company 
our net gain on investments for the year ended october  was million  resulting from the sale of united states government agency debt securities 
as of october  and october   we had net unrealized holding gains of million and million  respectively  associated with our remaining investment portfolio 
the carrying value of our equity investments in non publicly traded companies at october  and october  was million and zero  respectively 
provision for income taxes 
estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from variable stock option expenses  net operating losses  tax carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state and federal pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgments about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
cumulative losses incurred in the most recent four of the last six fiscal years represented sufficient 
table of contents negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance 
as of october   we had established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which we intend to maintain until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
future reversals or increases to our valuation allowance could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
in the year ended october   we have recorded income tax provision of million  compared to income tax provision of million and million in the years ended october  and october   respectively 
our income tax provision is primarily for our international operations 
we expect to continue to record an income tax provision for our international operations in the future 
since the company has a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which result from us operations  us income tax expense or benefits are offset by releasing or increasing  respectively  the valuation allowance 
to the extent that international revenues and earnings differ from those historically achieved  a factor largely influenced by the buying behavior of our oem partners  or unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations occur  our income tax provision could change 
we consider the operating earnings of some of our non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
no provision has been made for the united states federal and state  or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  the cumulative amount of which is approximately million as of october  if we repatriate foreign earnings  we will have to adjust the income tax provision in the provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the one time favorable foreign dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the american jobs creation act of  and may decide to repatriate some level of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in the future 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments were million as of october   a decrease of million over the prior year total of million 
for the year ended october   we generated million in cash from operating activities 
cash from operations significantly exceeded net loss for the year ended october  due to non cash expense items  primarily related to depreciation and amortization and loss on disposal of property and equipment  and an increase in deferred revenue 
cash from operations was partially reduced by lease termination fees associated with the purchase of the building near our san jose headquarters and an increase in accounts receivable 
days sales outstanding in receivables for the year ended october  was days 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended october  totaled million and was primarily the result of million in net purchases of short and long term investments and other non marketable investments  as well as million invested in capital equipment  including million for the purchase of the building near our san jose headquarters 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended october  totaled million 
net cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of repurchases of our convertible subordinated debt  partially offset by million in net proceeds from employee participation in employee stock programs and exercises of stock options 
net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity 
the extent to which our employees 
table of contents participate in these programs generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock 
as a result  our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs will vary 
as a result of our recent voluntary stock options exchange program  we do not expect to generate significant cash flow from the issuance of common stock related to the employee participation in employee stock programs during fiscal year unless our future common stock price exceeds per share 
we have manufacturing agreements with solectron and foxconn under which we provide twelve month product forecasts and place purchase orders in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
the required lead time for placing orders with both solectron and foxconn depends on the specific product 
as of october   our aggregate commitment to solectron and foxconn for inventory components used in the manufacture of brocade products was million  net of purchase commitment reserves of million  which we expect to utilize during future normal ongoing operations 
although the purchase orders we place with solectron and foxconn are cancelable  the terms of the agreements require us to purchase from solectron and foxconn all inventory components not returnable or usable by  or sold to  other customers of solectron or foxconn 
our purchase commitments reserve reflects our estimate of purchase commitments we do not expect to consume in normal operations 
on december   and january   we sold an aggregate of million in principal amount of two percent convertible subordinated notes due january the notes or convertible subordinated debt see note  convertible subordinated debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
holders of the notes may  in whole or in part  convert the notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes approximately million shares may be issued upon conversion based on outstanding debt of million as of october  at any time prior to maturity on january  at any time on or after january   we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the following prices expressed as a percentage of the principal amount redemption period price beginning on january  and ending on december  beginning on january  and ending on december  on january  we are required to pay interest on january and july of each year  beginning july  debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the notes 
the amortization of debt issuance costs will accelerate upon early redemption  repurchase  or conversion of the notes 
the net proceeds remain available for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
during fiscal years and  we repurchased on the open market million and million in face value of our convertible subordinated debt  respectively 
for the year ended october   we paid an average of on each dollar of face value for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
for the year ended october   we paid an average of on each dollar of face value for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
as of october   the remaining balance outstanding of the convertible subordinated debt was million 
on november   we purchased a previously leased building located near our san jose headquarters  and issued a million guarantee as part of the purchase agreements

share repurchase program 
in august  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock 
the purchases may be made  from time to time  in the open market and will be funded from available working capital 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the level of our cash balances  general business and market conditions  and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
to date  no shares had been purchased under this program 
equity investments 
under the terms of certain investment agreements related to our investments in non publicly traded companies  we may be required to make additional investments of up to million if certain milestones are met 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least through the next months  although we may elect to seek additional funding prior to that time  if available 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support our product development efforts and the expansion of our sales and marketing programs  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to our existing products  and market acceptance of our products 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate  on an on going basis  our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  excess inventory and purchase commitments  investments  warranty obligations  restructuring costs  lease losses  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the sec considers 
table of contents an entity s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and those that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time of estimation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  and allowances for sales returns  sales programs  and doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  warranty reserves  inventory and purchase commitment reserves  restructuring charges and lease loss reserves  litigation costs  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition  and allowances for sales returns  sales programs  and doubtful accounts 
product revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
however  for newly introduced products  many of our large oem customers require a product qualification period during which our products are tested and approved by the oem customer for sale to their customers 
revenue recognition  and related cost  is deferred for shipments to new oem customers and for shipments of newly introduced products to existing oem customers until satisfactory evidence of completion of the product qualification has been received from the oem customer 
in addition  revenue from sales to our master reseller customers is recognized in the same period in which the product is sold by the master reseller sell through 
we reduce revenue for estimated sales returns  sales programs  and other allowances at the time of shipment 
sales returns  sales programs  and other allowances are estimated based on historical experience  current trends  and our expectations regarding future experience 
reductions to revenue associated with sales returns  sales programs  and other allowances include consideration of historical sales levels  the timing and magnitude of historical sales returns  claims under sales programs  and other allowances  and a projection of this experience into the future 
in addition  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  which are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable  historical collection patterns  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in customer payment terms and practices  and customer communication when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if actual sales returns  sales programs  and other allowances exceed our estimate  or if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and charges may be required 
service revenue consists of training  warranty  and maintenance arrangements  including post contract customer support pcs services 
pcs services are offered under renewable  annual fee based contracts or as part of multiple element arrangements and typically include upgrades and enhancements to our software operating system software  and telephone support 
service revenue  including revenue allocated to pcs elements  is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual period 
service contracts are typically one to three years in length 
training revenue is recognized upon completion of the training 
our multiple element product offerings include computer hardware and software products  and support services 
we also sell certain software products and support services separately 
our software products are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and are  therefore  accounted for in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
we allocate revenue to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the element or  if vsoe is not available  by application of the residual method 
vsoe of the fair value for an element is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
changes in the allocation of revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement may affect the timing of revenue recognition

accounting for income taxes 
the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations in multiple tax jurisdictions outside the united states 
sales to our international customers are principally taxed at rates that are lower than the united states statutory rates 
the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving and expect to receive from international sales 
in addition  an increase in the percentage of our total revenue from international customers or in the mix of international revenue among particular tax jurisdictions could change our overall effective tax rate 
also  our current effective tax rate assumes that united states income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to united states federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes  as applicable  should they be either deemed or actually remitted from our international subsidiaries to the united states 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is subject to a full valuation allowance 
at some point in the future  the company may have sufficient united states taxable income to release the valuation allowance and accrue united states tax 
we evaluate the expected realization of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances quarterly
