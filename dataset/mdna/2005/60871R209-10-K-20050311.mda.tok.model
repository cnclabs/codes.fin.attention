item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary our results reflect good financial performance for the coors business  despite challenging competitive dynamics in all of our major markets 
net sales were up  net income grew  and earnings per share increased 
these positive results were driven by solid beer pricing and continued progress on cost reduction initiatives 
our full year profit growth also benefited from gains on asset sales and favorable foreign exchange rates 
pretax income for the americas segment was million  up from a year ago  driven primarily by solid us beer pricing  sales of non operating assets  and the lapping of lower sales and higher costs in the fourth quarter last year due to us supply chain challenges 
these positive factors more than offset sales volume decreases and higher costs in the united states 
in addition  higher income from our coors light business in canada contributed to americas full year profits 
pretax income for the europe segment was million  up from a year ago 
europe financial results in benefited from a year over year appreciation of the british pound against the us dollar  following an appreciation in of 
this boosted europe income by million in and million in  although part of this benefit was offset by higher interest expense on our pound denominated debt 
besides favorable exchange rates  higher europe income was driven by off trade volume growth  better pricing and  subsequently  higher margins in both the on trade and the off trade 
we also realized a million pretax gain on the sale of our cape hill brewery property 
we repaid debt obligations totaling million in while the business continued to generate strong operating cash flow  sales of non operating assets and controlled capital spending contributed heavily to the de leveraging effort 
with the completion of our merger  we are now the fifth largest brewer in the world

collection of fuel price surcharges from customers added million 
net sales for the america segment increased million or from to on a per barrel basis  net sales increased while volume decreased year over year 
net sales were impacted positively by favorable pricing in the united states million  as well as significant growth in our canadian business million 
the challenges over the past two years to our sales have included volume impacted negatively by growth of consumer interest in low carbohydrate diets and flavored alcohol beverages  competition to the beer business from wine and spirits  and a mix shift toward lower revenue per barrel brands such as keystone light  which has experienced volume growth of since  offset in by higher sales of aspen edge  zima xxx  and blue moon 
cost of goods sold and gross profit americas cost of goods sold increased million or in  compared to on a per barrel basis  the increase was approximately 
the increase is the net effect of inflation primarily higher fuel and packaging costs million  as well as increased labor related expenses million and a mix shift to higher cost brands and packages  such as aspen edge in million  offset by the lapping of extra expense related to our supply chain challenges in million  and the implementation of fin r which had the effect of reducing our cost of sales by re allocating certain joint venture expenses in our income statement out of cost of sales million 
overall  gross profit increased from in to in  with pricing and other factors positively impacting revenue per barrel being the primary drivers 
americas cost of goods sold decreased by million or in versus  but increased on a per barrel basis by 
the overall net increase in cost of goods per barrel was due to higher pension and other labor related costs million and additional costs due to information technology upgrades million  offset by lower volume  packaging rebates and cost savings from reorganizations in our higher pension costs were the result of lower returns on pension assets in recent years and lower discount rates 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of increased costs in the fourth quarter of  primarily related to extra freight  direct labor and finished goods loss associated with our new supply chain processes and systems implementation 
overall  gross profit increased from to  with pricing and canadian growth slightly outweighing the negative impacts to cost of goods per barrel 
marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses increased million in  compared to  or

the special item represents the gain recognized on the sale of our cape hill property 
earnings before income taxes in includes   net of tax of the minority owner s share of income attributable to the grolsch joint venture 
foreign currency impact on results our europe segment benefited from a and year over year increase in the value of the british pound sterling gbp against the us dollar in and  respectively 
as a result of this exchange rate fluctuation  all results from our europe segment in are significantly higher than in the prior year  however  the increases are tempered by increased interest costs in the corporate segment as a result of our hedging activities related to gbp denominated debt 
for example  corporate unallocated expense was adversely affected by foreign currency increases on gbp denominated hedges by approximately million in the following table summarizes the approximate effect the changes in exchange rate had on the europe results as presented above in and increase due to currency effects in thousands net sales   cost of goods sold   gross profit   marketing  general administrative and special item   operating income   interest income   other income expense  net  income before income taxes and minority interests   for  assuming the same rates as  for  assuming the same rates as net sales and volume net sales for the europe segment increased in  while volume increased from the previous year 
approximately of the net sales increase represents the effect of currency exchange rates 
the volume growth was driven by the carling and grolsch brands  which grew volume for the year by approximately and  respectively 
volume growth for the year was restricted by the cooler and wetter summer weather in the united kingdom compared to a record breaking summer in and the comparison to a period of high off trade discounting in the first half of our on trade business  which represents approximately two thirds of our europe volume and an even greater portion of margin  saw volume decline marginally by compared to this compared to an overall on trade market decline of in the year  yielding a market share gain of approximately 
our off trade volume for increased approximately over  led by carling and grolsch 
our off trade market share growth for the year was approximately percentage points 
in addition to the volume movements documented above  we had positive pricing in both the on trade and the off trade  and an increase in the sales value of factored brands 
these gains were partially offset by negative channel and brand mix 
owned brand net sales per barrel increased approximately for the year 
net sales for the europe segment increased in  while volume increased from the previous year 
the significant increase in net sales and volume was partly due to our owning the cbl business for the full year in versus forty seven weeks in currency exchange rates accounted for of the net sales increase 
on a full year comparative basis  our sales volumes increased 
this growth was driven by the carling and grolsch brands  both of which grew volume by more than during the year 
our on trade business grew volume by approximately compared to the full year as a result of strong sales execution  particularly with carling and carling extra cold  and unusually hot weather in the united kingdom during the summer in in a declining on trade market  this yielded a market share gain of approximately 
our off trade volume for increased approximately over the comparable period in  led by carling and grolsch 
contributing factors to this volume growth were the favorable summer weather and aggressive discounting  primarily in the first half of our off trade market share growth for was approximately one percentage point 
our positive volume in both the on and off trade and positive pricing in the on trade were partially offset by a decline in our on trade factored brand sales and  in the off trade  heavy price discounting and mix shift toward lower revenue per barrel sales 
the decline in sales of factored brands in the on trade was driven by some of our large on trade chain customers purchasing products from other suppliers 
cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold increased in versus  with approximately of the increase being due to the effect of currency exchange rates 
the increase in local currency cost of goods sold was driven by increased volume and higher labor costs  together with a mix shift to the off trade where products have higher packaging costs  and an increase in the value of factored brand purchases where the cost is included in our cost of goods sold 
these increases were offset by the benefit to costs of goods sold of implementing finr  and a reduction in contract packaging costs from  where we contracted with regional brewers to package some of our off trade volume while we were commissioning the new and upgraded packaging lines in our burton brewery 
on a per barrel basis  cost of goods sold increased  excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cost of goods sold per barrel was broadly flat compared to gross profit in the europe segment increased  and excluding the impact of foreign exchange  gross profit increased 
gross profit per barrel increased  and by excluding the impact of foreign exchange 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased during cost of goods sold increased in versus on a per barrel basis  cost of goods sold increased 
the aggregate increase in cost of goods sold was driven by increased volume and higher foreign exchange rates  coupled with owning the business for the full year versus only a partial period in also driving this increase  and the increase in the per barrel cost  was the reclassification of tradeteam earnings from cost of goods sold to other income beginning in and the loss of income from contract brewing arrangements that substantially ceased near the end of additionally  during the first three quarters of  we incurred higher production costs as we contracted with regional brewers to package some of our off trade volume while we were commissioning new packaging lines in our burton brewery 
we realized some benefit from right sizing and improving our uk production infrastructure towards the latter half of  which partially offset the increases noted above 
the increases in cost of goods sold were also reduced by the decrease in factored brand volume where the purchase cost is included in our cost of goods sold  but the related volume is not included in reported volumes 
gross profit in the europe segment increased in  compared to  however  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  gross profit was essentially flat despite the inclusion of a full year of sales in gross profit per barrel decreased and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased during as a result of the reclassification of tradeteam earnings to other income in  and our contract packaging costs incurred as we commissioned the packaging lines in burton 
marketing  general and administrative expenses europe marketing  general and administrative expenses increased during  and on a per barrel basis 
foreign exchange accounted for the great majority of this increase 
various factors increased marketing  general and administrative expenses during a we had higher labor related and information technology costs  b in  costs were reduced by a one time gain of million before tax on the sale of the rights to our hooper s hooch fab brand in russia  and c implementation of finr transferred costs from cost of goods sold into marketing  general and administrative costs 
these increases were partly offset by decreased marketing costs 
spend on marketing core brands increased nearly including investment relating to the launch of coors fine light beer  however this was more than offset by a decrease in spending on non core brands as the business has focused on its key growth brands for the future 
europe marketing  general and administrative expenses increased during almost entirely due to exchange rates and the impact of the full year of ownership of cbl 
on a per barrel basis  marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased year over year 
various factors impacted marketing  general and administrative expenses during  which effectively off set each other a we had higher investments in sales staff and increased depreciation charges from investments in information systems and dispense equipment  the latter supporting the sales growth in the on trade  b we were impacted by the loss of reimbursements from the transitional services arrangements with interbrew sa that were set up following the cbl acquisition in february and largely concluded by the end of that year 
these reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to marketing  general and administrative expenses in  c we realized savings in employee bonus costs and directors costs  and d the one time gain of million on the sale of the rights to our hooper s hooch fab brand in russia during the third quarter 
other expense income  net the adverse movement in other expense income  net in was a result of a decline in tradeteam operating performance  currency exchange rate movements  and increased non operating leasehold expenses 
in  other income increased as a result of the inclusion of tradeteam income included in cost of goods sold in and currency exchange rate movements  partially offset by an increase in non operating leasehold expenses 
interest income interest income is earned on trade loans to uk on trade customers 
interest income decreased in despite favorable foreign exchange rates  as a result of lower loan balances in interest income increased in as a result of favorable foreign exchange rates  the inclusion of an additional five weeks of results in  netted against lower loan balances in corporate corporate includes interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocated to either the americas or europe operating segments 
corporate contains no sales or cost of goods sold  although certain royalty income and intangible administrative costs are absorbed by corporate 
the majority of these corporate costs relates to worldwide finance and administrative functions  such as corporate affairs  legal  human resources  insurance and risk management

approximately million were expensed in marketing  general and administrative expenses during consists of foreign currency exchange gains losses  bank fees and gains on sales of investments 
loss before income taxes in includes  of the minority owner s share of interest expense attributable to debt obligations of the rmmc joint venture 
n m not meaningful marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses were approximately million higher in  than  due to increased incentive compensation costs million  other labor related costs million  and merger and regulatory compliance costs million 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in increased significantly from for similar reasons  except for the cost of the merger with molson 
regulatory compliance costs have increased of necessity  due to implementation of procedures to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of over the past two years 
interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased nearly in  compared to due to our paydown of debt and from swapping some of our debt from fixed to floating rates 
full year debt repayments at million  were about above our cash flow and debt pay downbenefited from asset monetizations and capital spending discipline in in the three years since we bought the uk business  we have repaid million of debt principal as of year end interest expense increased million or in this increase was driven by having our fixed rate debt structure in place for the full year in versus only eight months in and the currency appreciation on our gbp denominated term debt prior to its payoff in august the increase is also due to our cross currency swap structure and our gbp denominated interest expense 
partially offsetting these factors was the implementation of our lower interest rate commercial paper program in june  the initial proceeds of which we used to pay down approximately million of higher rate gbp denominated term debt 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities  external borrowings and asset monetizations 
as of december   including cash and short term borrowings  we had positive working capital of million compared to negative working capital of million at december  at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  compared to million at december  the improvement in our working capital is due to the consolidation of rmmc  rmbc and grolsch million and cash management 
the increase in cash is mainly due to cash acquired when our joint ventures were consolidated in the first quarter of million  cash received from interbrew million related to the settlement of a pension liability dispute and reduced capital spending approximately million 
we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term borrowings  when necessary  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements  scheduled principal and interest payments on debt  dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products  which could arise from competitive circumstances  a decline in the acceptability of alcohol beverages  any shift away from light beers and any of the other factors we describe in the section titled risk factors 
we also have credit facilities that contain financial and operating covenants  and provide for scheduled repayments  that could impact our liquidity on an ongoing basis 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to supplement our operating cash flow through potential monetizations of assets 
during the second quarter of  cbl outsourced the ownership  procurement and tracking of its approximately million kegs and casks with trenstar  inc as a result  we received a cash payment of approximately million million at second quarter rates 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold certain land holdings in golden  colorado and received cash related to the sale of our cape hill facility in the uk 
in total  our proceeds from asset monetizations in were million 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  compared to the decrease is primarily due to an increase in cash taxes in versus when favorable finalization of tax audits resulted in refunds  offset by the reporting of additional cash flows as a result of consolidating certain joint ventures in also  improved sales at the end of  compared to resulted in higher receivable and inventory balances  which served to lower cash flows from operations in net cash provided by operating activities increased million in compared to the decrease was attributable primarily to cash provided by trade receivables and payables in the result of continued emphasis on working capital management by improving receivable collection in the united kingdom  the favorable impact of tax audits in and managing the purchasing cycle throughout the company in investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased million during  compared to this improvement is attributable to reduced capital spending in  cash received from the sale of kegs in the uk  and the pension settlement received in from interbrew 
also  we presented as an investing activity the inclusion of the opening cash balances of the joint ventures we began consolidating during the first quarter of as result of implementing fin r see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item 
during the fiscal year ended december   we used net cash of million in investing activities compared to billion used in the decrease in net cash used is due to the billion payment  net of cash acquired  made to purchase cbl in however  excluding our  billion payment to acquire cbl  total cash used in investing activities increased approximately million compared to the same period in  mainly due to the absence of sales and maturities of investments in versus a significant amount of investments was sold in to help fund the acquisition of cbl 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million in the change is mainly the result of increased repayments of debt in  offset by cash received from increased stock option exercises during the year 
we have also included a new item  dividends paid to minority interest holders  in the financing activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows 
this item represents distributions from our joint ventures consolidated as result of fin r to the minority interest holders in those joint ventures 
there is no significant net impact to cash flows as a result of the adoption of fin r 
however  from a year over year comparison standpoint  cash flows from operating activities have been increased and cash flows from financing activities have been decreased as a result of classifying dividends paid to minority interest holder in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  representing a billion decrease from cash provided by financing activities in this decrease is primarily attributable to the billion proceeds from issuance of debt in  partially offset by larger payments on debt and capital lease obligations in debt related activity in reflected net payments of long and short term debt totaling million whereas in  debt related activity reflected a net increase in long and short term debt of billion  due primarily to borrowings related to our acquisition of cbl

since the acquisition  we have used cash from operating activities and from asset monetizations  net of capital expenditures and other cash used in investing activities  to make payments on our debt obligations 
some of our debt instruments require us to meet certain covenant restrictions  including financial tests and other limitations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants
