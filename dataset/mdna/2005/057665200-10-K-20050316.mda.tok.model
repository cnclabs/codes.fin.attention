results of operations overview the company develops  manufactures  distributes and markets specialty performance ingredients and products for the food  feed and medical sterilization industries 
the company s reportable segments are strategic businesses that offer products and services to different markets 
the company presently has three reportable segments  specialty products  encapsulated nutritional products and bcp ingredients 
specialty products segment the specialty products segment repackages and distributes the following specialty gases ethylene oxide  blends of ethylene oxide  propylene oxide and methyl chloride 
ethylene oxide  at the level  is sold as a chemical sterilant gas  primarily for use in the health care industry and is used to sterilize medical devices 
contract sterilizers  medical device manufacturers and medical gas distributors are the company s principal customers for this product 
blends of ethylene oxide are sold as fumigants and are highly effective in killing bacteria  fungi  and insects in spices and other seasoning type materials 
in addition  the company also sells single use canisters with ethylene oxide for use in medical device sterilization 
propylene oxide and methyl chloride are sold principally to customers seeking smaller as opposed to bulk quantities 
management believes that future success in this segment is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent quality  safety and customer service 
encapsulated nutritional products the encapsulated nutritional products segment predominantly encapsulates performance ingredients for use throughout the food and animal health industries to enhance nutritional fortification  prepared food processing  packaging applications and shelf life improvement 
major end product applications are baked goods  refrigerated and frozen dough systems  processed meats  seasoning blends and confections 
management believes this segment s key strengths are its proprietary technology and end product application capabilities 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue in this segment is highly dependent on the timing of marketing launches of new products in the us and international food market by the company s customers and prospects 
the company  through its innovative proprietary technology and applications expertise  continues to develop new microencapsulation products designed to solve and respond to customer problems and needs 
sales of our reashure tm and nitroshure tm products for the animal nutrition and health industry are highly dependent on dairy industry economics as well as the ability of the company to leverage the results of existing successful university research on the animal health benefits of this product 
bcp ingredients bcp ingredients manufactures and supplies choline chloride  an essential nutrient for animal health  to the poultry and swine industries 
in addition  certain derivatives of choline chloride are also marketed into industrial applications 
management believes that success in this commodity oriented marketplace is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent product quality and customer service 
in addition  the company must continue to increase production efficiencies in order to maintain its low cost position to effectively compete for market share in a highly competitive marketplace 
the company sells products for all three segments through its own sales force  independent distributors  and sales agents

operating expenses operating expenses for declined to  from  for  a decrease of  or 
total operating expenses as a percentage of sales were for compared to for this decrease was principally a result of a decrease in selling  marketing and research expenses  a result of the company having made several organizational and business changes affecting the encapsulated nutritional products segment 
many of these changes were effected late in the fourth quarter of in an effort to refocus our commercial efforts  reduce operating expenses and improve the overall financial performance of this segment 
these decreases were partially offset by increased charges for search fees associated with new hires and higher professional fees including those required to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of during and  the company spent  and  respectively  on company sponsored research and development programs  substantially all of which pertained to the company s encapsulated nutritional products segment for both food and animal health applications

propylene oxide volume also increased in by 
net sales for the encapsulated nutritional products segment were  for compared with  for  a decrease of  or 
of particular significance  the prior year comparable period included substantial sales  approximately  to a single domestic food customer in support of a new product launch 
while this customer s end consumer product continues to be in distribution  the company did not realize any sales to this customer in due to slower than expected market acceptance of the new end product 
the remaining decrease was largely a result of unfavorable product mix and a volume decline in sales to the domestic food market 
the company experienced conservative customer purchasing patterns and delayed new product launches by customers in the united states 
net sales of  were realized for in the bcp ingredients unencapsulated feed supplements segment  which markets choline additives for the poultry and swine industries as well as industrial choline derivative products  compared with  for  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily a result of increased volumes sold over the prior comparable period in the choline chloride and specialty derivative markets 
gross margin gross margin percentage for was compared to for margins for the specialty products segment were favorably affected by increased production volumes of the company s products utilizing ethylene oxide 
margins in the encapsulated nutritional products segment were unfavorably affected by the decline in sales volume as described above 
these lower sales levels  coupled with a designed reduction in inventory levels in this segment  negatively impacted the company s gross margins due to the resulting excess plant manufacturing capacity 
in addition  increased competition in both the domestic and international food markets during the fourth quarter resulted in lower volumes sold and lower average selling prices which contributed to the erosion in profit margins for this segment 
margins for bcp ingredients were favorably affected by increased production volumes of choline chloride and specialty derivative products 
the decision to reduce inventory levels while maintaining prior levels of plant manufacturing capacity in the encapsulated nutritional products segment  generated unfavorable manufacturing variances 
however  such decision contributed greatly toward an improved cash balance at december  increases in employee medical claims under our self insurance program  as well as increases in the company s plant and other insurance premiums due to unfavorable insurance marketplace conditions  had a negative impact on margins for all segments 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased to  from  for  an increase of  or

critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following policies to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon product shipment  passage of title and risk of loss and when collection is reasonably assured 
the company reports amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes costs incurred for shipping and handling in cost of sales 
amounts received for unshipped merchandise are not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded as customer deposits and are included in current liabilities 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a product exceeds twelve months of demand for that product and or when individual products have been in inventory for greater than six months 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if an indicator of impairment exists  the company determines the amount of impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair values of its goodwill to its carrying value 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  europe  mexico and japan 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
postemployment benefits the company provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions as to general economic conditions and health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act introduced a plan sponsor subsidy based on a percentage of a beneficiary s annual prescription drug benefits  within defined limits  and the opportunity for a retiree to obtain prescription drug benefits under medicare 
there was no impact of the subsidy on the postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic cost in as medicare eligible retirees are not covered under the company s plan 
intangible assets with finite lives the useful life of an intangible asset is based on the company s assumptions regarding expected use of the asset  the relationship of the intangible asset to another asset or group of assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset or that enable renewal or extension of the asset s legal or contractual life without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on the asset s useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the life of an intangible asset has changed  it could result in higher future amortization charges or recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and would establish a valuation allowance if it believed that such assets may not be recovered  taking into consideration historical operating results  expectations of future earnings  changes in its operations and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
related party transactions during  the company was not engaged in related party transactions and all transactions of the company were at arms length
