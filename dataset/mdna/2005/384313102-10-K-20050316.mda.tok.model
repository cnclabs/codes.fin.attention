item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our businesses are organized around three lines of business a synthetic graphite line of business  a natural graphite line of business and an advanced carbon materials line of business 
our synthetic graphite line of business constitutes its own reportable segment  and our natural graphite and advanced carbon materials lines of business together constitute our other reportable segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for certain information regarding our reportable segments and geographic areas 
reference is also made to the information under part i for background information on our businesses  industry and related matters 
global economic conditions and outlook we are impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as global  regional or country conditions fluctuate 
over the three years prior to the first half  we faced extremely challenging business and industry conditions 
adverse global and regional economic conditions negatively impacted many of the end markets for our products 
many of the customers in these markets reduced production levels  became less creditworthy  filed for bankruptcy protection or were acquired as part of consolidation trends within their industries 
in addition  for most of this period  industry wide capacity for most of our products exceeded demand 
such factors reduced demand and prices for products sold by us 
global and certain regional economic conditions began to strengthen in the second half 
steel production increased globally and was particularly strong in china 
we estimate that worldwide steel production was about million metric tons in we estimate that eaf steel production increased to about million metric tons in we believe that the graphite electrode industry manufacturing capacity utilization rate was about in and in we operated our graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at very high levels in the strengthening in the steel industry in and the tightening of the graphite electrode supply demand balance lead to an increase in average graphite electrode prices in as compared to demand for cathodes in excluding china decreased from because of reduced construction of new aluminum smelters 
we operated our cathode manufacturing capacity at relatively high operating levels in demand for carbon refractories was strong in as a result of our increased penetration of various markets  including europe and china  and increased blast furnace construction and refurbishment 
weak economic conditions resulted in relatively low demand and weak pricing in for most of our other products 
global and regional economic conditions continued to strengthen throughout and steel demand and production remained strong 
we estimate that worldwide steel production was about billion metric tons in  about higher than in we estimate that electric arc furnace steel production increased in to million metric tons as compared to we estimate that worldwide aluminum production was about million metric tons in  about higher than in worldwide graphite electrode demand increased to approximately million metric tons driven by increased steel production and  in particular  eaf steel production 
graphite electrode supply remained tight for graphite electrodes used in eaf melter applications 
graphite electrode prices for the eaf melter segment increased over the course of we believe that the graphite electrode industry manufacturing capacity utilization rate worldwide was about in we operated our graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at virtually maximum operating levels throughout demand for cathodes increased slightly in as compared to  primarily due to the construction of new aluminum smelting furnaces  offset by delays in relines of existing furnaces as a result of longer pot lifes from technology improvements 
consolidation of aluminum companies  including alcan s acquisition of pechiney  also delayed the start of known new smelter projects  further offsetting cathode demand 
we believe that  currently  there is an excess supply of cathodes  on a worldwide basis 
we believe that  over the long term  demand for graphite cathodes will increase relative to semi graphitic cathodes as new smelting furnaces are built 
demand for carbon refractories strengthened consistent with growth in integrated steel production in and related increases in blast furnace lining refurbishments and  to a lesser extent  new blast furnace construction 
demand for carbon electrodes strengthened consistent with increases in production of silicon metal 
demand for our advanced synthetic graphite products strengthened in as compared to  consistent with increased production by the customers we serve in the semiconductor  electronics  energy and transportation industries 
throughout  we experienced upward pressure on most of our raw material costs  including freight  energy and petroleum based raw materials 
these cost increases impacted all of our product lines in both the synthetic and advanced carbon materials lines of business 
we believe these cost increases were experienced industry wide 
demand for thermal management solutions in smaller  more powerful electronic devices continued to grow rapidly in our etm solutions are enabling some of the most advanced  thinnest and lightest products being sold today 
these devices include  among others  plasma display panels  liquid crystal displays  ultra lightweight laptops and cell phones 
sales of our etm products grew significantly to million in as compared to million in outlook 
we believe that global and regional economic conditions will continue to be strong in  as compared to  resulting in increased steel and aluminum production 
synthetic graphite 
over the course of  we modified the terms and conditions under which we sell graphite electrodes to build in more flexibility to adjust product pricing based on market conditions  including among other things  demand  raw material availability and production costs 
after continued assessment of the market conditions for melter graphite electrodes and persistent upward trends in production costs  we initiated a base price adjustment a bpa during the fourth quarter on orders booked that were subject to our modified terms and conditions 
as a result of this action and continued book building at higher prices  we expect average melter graphite electrode revenue per metric ton to be approximately or higher than in in the non melter graphite electrode segment  prices vary significantly due to the variety of end markets and performance requirements across those end markets and  to a lesser extent  higher availability of lower grade products 
average revenue per metric ton in this segment is expected to increase approximately as compared to based on these pricing actions  we expect average graphite electrode revenue per metric ton  including both melter and non melter segments  will be between  and  approximately to higher than in we expect graphite electrode sales volume in to be approximately  metric tons 
we purchase our raw materials from a variety of sources 
for  we have secured virtually all of our needle coke volume requirements and have locked in price on the volume 
we expect our graphite electrode production costs  including the impact on profitability from potentially lower utilization rates of our graphite electrode capacity  will increase by approximately to in as compared to approximately half of the increase is expected from inflation in production costs  in particular coke  energy and freight 
we have entered into firm price contracts for approximately of our graphite electrode production costs  excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
the balance of the increase is expected from the impact of changes in currency exchange rates as virtually all of our graphite electrode production is outside the united states 
we expect demand for our cathodes to increase slightly in over our venture with alcan pechiney  which is a owner of our cathode business and which purchases cathodes from us under requirements contracts that remain in effect through  continues to position us as the leading supplier of cathodes to the aluminum industry 
we believe that  over the long term  demand for graphite cathodes will increase relative to semi graphitic cathodes as new smelting furnaces are built  thereby reducing the current excess supply of graphite cathodes 
other 
we expect growing net sales of our electronic thermal management products and services 
we have hired and are continuing to hire additional personnel in sales  marketing and research and development to support our growth 
we have a formal targeted hiring plan to grow the advanced energy technology team from approximately employees currently to about employees over the next months 
these resources will focus on the continued growth of the electronic thermal management business as we continue to leverage our successes to penetrate new customers and applications and identify new market opportunities 
we estimate sales of these products to increase by at least in as compared to we expect continued strong demand for most of our other products  with incremental profitability due to product mix and prices 
in particular  demand for carbon electrodes in the us and demand for advance synthetic graphite products used in the transportation  oil and gas and metallurgical industries continues to be strong 
in addition  demand for our carbon refractories continues to be strong as a result of our increased penetration of various markets  particularly europe and china  and increased blast furnace construction and refurbishment 
we continue to seek to drive productivity and cost improvements in all of these businesses 
we expect our net sales to increase by over in as compared to the cash tax rate is targeted to be less than  whereas the effective tax rate is expected to be between to 
capital expenditures are estimated to be million and depreciation expense is estimated to be million in our outlook could be significantly impacted by  among other things  factors described under item risk factors and forward looking statements in this report 
financing transactions in february  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes at a price of of principal amount 
in may  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of additional senior notes at a price of of principal amount  plus accrued interest from february the senior notes bear interest at an annual rate of and mature in the net proceeds from the offering completed in february were million 
the net proceeds excluding accrued interest paid by the purchasers of the senior notes from the offering completed in may were million 
we used all of the net proceeds to reduce the balance outstanding under the revolving facility and to repay term loans outstanding under the senior facilities 
during  we exchanged million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  plus accrued interest of million  for approximately million shares of our common stock and we purchased million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  plus accrued interest  for million in cash 
in october  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in a registered public offering at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds from this offering were approximately million  of which million was used to repay term loans outstanding under the senior facilities  million was used to reduce the balance outstanding under the revolving facility  and the balance was used to repay other short term debt 
on january   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of debentures at a price of of principal amount 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds to repay the remaining million of term loans outstanding under the senior facilities  to make provisional payments of million against the fine the eu antitrust fine that was assessed against us in by the directorate general iv of the european communities the eu competition authority  and to fund general corporate purposes  including replacement of financing previously provided by factoring of accounts receivable and strategic acquisitions that are complementary to our businesses 
the balance was invested in short term  investment quality  interest bearing securities or deposits 
in  we exchanged million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  plus accrued interest of million  for million shares of common stock 
additionally  we purchased million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  plus accrued interest  for million in cash 
on february   we completed a substantial amendment and restatement of the credit agreement to effect a refinancing of the revolving facility 
we believe the refinancing has enhanced our stability and liquidity 
the revolving facility now provides for loans and letters of credit in a maximum amount outstanding at any time of up to million and matures in july as a result of the refinancing  we have no material debt scheduled to mature prior to july at the time of the refinancing  no loans were outstanding and approximately million of letters of credit were outstanding under the credit agreement 
as amended and restated  the credit agreement now provides for  among other things  lower interest rates reducing spreads by over basis points  less restrictive financial covenants and  subject to certain conditions including a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test  an accordion feature that permits us to establish additional credit facilities thereunder in an aggregate amount  together with the revolving facility  of up to million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding the refinancing of the revolving facility 
litigation against our former parent companies initiated by us in february  we commenced a lawsuit against our former parents  mitsubishi corporation and union carbide corporation  to recover certain payments made to them in connection with our leveraged equity recapitalization in january as well as certain unjust receipts by them from their investments in us and damages for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties owed to us by our former senior management in connection with illegal graphite electrode price fixing activities 
we are seeking to recover more than billion  including interest 
on january   the united states district court for the southern district of new york the sdny district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss the lawsuits 
we appealed this decision to the us second circuit court of appeals the circuit court of appeals  which affirmed the dismissal 
we have sought a rehearing before the circuit court of appeals 
we expect to incur million to million for legal expenses to pursue this lawsuit from the date of filing the complaint through appeal and ultimately trial 
through december   we had incurred about million of these legal expenses 
this lawsuit is in its earliest stages  and the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit is subject to many uncertainties 
antitrust litigation against us since  we and other producers and distributors of graphite and carbon products have been subject to antitrust investigations by antitrust authorities in the us  the european union  canada  japan and korea 
in addition  civil antitrust lawsuits have been commenced and threatened against us and other producers and distributors of graphite and carbon products in the us  canada and elsewhere 
in april  gti pled guilty to a one count charge of violating us federal antitrust law in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes and was sentenced to pay a non interest bearing fine in the aggregate amount of million  payable in six annual installments 
the payment schedule has been revised periodically at our request 
as of december   million has been paid on the doj antitrust fine including imputed interest of million 
the payment schedule for the remaining million balance consists of quarterly installments ranging from million to million  payable through january beginning in  the doj may ask the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania the district court to accelerate the payment schedule based on a change in our ability to make such payments 
interest began to accrue on the unpaid balance  commencing in april  at the statutory interest rate of per annum 
accrued interest is payable together with each quarterly payment 
in july  the eu competition authority assessed a fine of million against us for violating antitrust laws of the european community and the european economic area in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes 
after an in depth analysis of the decision  in october  we filed an appeal challenging  among other things  the amount of the eu antitrust fine  including the accrual of interest and the rate thereof 
in february and april  we posted million and million  respectively  with the eu competition authority as a provisional payment against the eu antitrust fine and accrued interest at a rate of per annum 
on april   the eu antitrust fine was reduced on appeal to million  plus accrued interest of million at a rate of per annum  an aggregate of about million at currency exchange rates in effect at the time the decision on the appeal was issued 
as a result of this reduction  in june  we received a refund of million million based on currency exchange rates then in effect from the eu competition authority 
except as described above  the antitrust investigations against us in the us  canada  the european union  japan and korea with respect to graphite electrodes and in the european union with respect to isostatic and extruded specialty graphite have been finally resolved 
it is possible that antitrust investigations seeking  among other things  to impose fines and penalties could be initiated against us by antitrust authorities in other jurisdictions 
we have settled  among other things  virtually all of the actual and potential claims against us by customers in the us and canada arising out of alleged antitrust violations occurring prior to the date of the relevant settlement in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes  carbon electrodes and bulk graphite products 
all settlement payments due have been timely paid 
none of the settlements or plea agreements contain restrictions on future prices of our graphite electrodes or other products 
there remain  however  certain pending claims as well as pending lawsuits in the us relating to the sale of graphite electrodes sold to foreign customers 
it is also possible that additional antitrust lawsuits and claims could be asserted against us in the us or other jurisdictions 
since  we have recorded pretax charges of million against results of operations as a reserve for potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
the charges of million are calculated on a basis that i excludes  among other things  both actual and imputed interest on the doj antitrust fine and ii includes  among other things  the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on the euro denominated eu antitrust fine and interest accrued on the eu antitrust fine 
interest on the doj antitrust fine including interest that  for accounting purposes  is imputed on the doj antitrust fine for the period during which it was non interest bearing is recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
to the extent that aggregate liabilities and expenses  net  are known or reasonably estimable  as of december   million represents our estimate of these liabilities and expenses 
through december   we paid an aggregate of million of fines and net settlements and expenses of which million has been applied against the reserve and million of imputed interest has not been applied against the reserve 
in the aggregate  the fines and net settlements and expenses are within the amounts we used to evaluate the aggregate charges of million 
our insurance has not and will not materially cover liabilities that have or may become due in connection with antitrust investigations or related lawsuits or claims 
at december  and  million and million remained in the reserve  respectively 
at december   the reserve was unfunded and was available primarily for the remaining scheduled doj antitrust fine payments 
actual aggregate liabilities and expenses including settled investigations  lawsuits and claims  as well as pending appeals and unsettled pending  threatened and possible lawsuits and claims mentioned above could be materially higher than million and the timing of payment thereof could be sooner than anticipated 
customer base we are a global company and serve all major geographic markets 
sales of our products to customers outside the us accounted for about of our net sales in  of our net sales in and of our net sales in our customer base includes both steel and non steel producers 
in  three of our ten largest customers were purchasers of non graphite electrode products 
in  five of our ten largest customers were based in europe  two were in the us and one was in each of canada  mexico and brazil 
no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounted for more than of our net sales in results of operations financial information discussed below omits our non strategic composite tooling business that was sold in june and has been accounted for as discontinued operations 
the results of our discontinued operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations 
compared to net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from net sales of million in primarily due to higher net sales in our synthetic graphite line of business 
cost of sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from cost of sales of million in  primarily due to higher sales volumes 
gross profit of million in represented a million  or  increase from gross profit of million in gross margin increased to of net sales in from of net sales in see below for further details regarding such changes 
synthetic graphite segment 
net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from net sales of million in  primarily due to higher sales volume of graphite electrodes and higher average graphite electrode sales revenue per metric ton 
volume of graphite electrodes sold was  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in the higher volume of graphite electrodes sold represented an increase of million in net sales 
average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes in was  as compared to  in the higher average sales revenue per metric ton represented an increase of million in net sales  approximately one third of which was due to the positive impact of net changes in currency exchange rates 
such increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of million due primarily to changes in product and geographical mix 
the remaining million increase in net sales in the synthetic graphite segment occurred almost equally within advanced synthetic graphite products and cathode and related products 
advanced synthetic graphite product sales increased primarily due to the strengthening in the semiconductor  electronics  energy and transportation markets 
higher volumes of products sold increased net sales by million while improved pricing increased net sales by million 
remaining increases were due to net favorable impacts of currency exchange rate changes 
cathodes and related product net sales increased primarily due to million of net favorable impacts of currency exchange rate changes and million due to a favorable change in product mix  offset by negative pricing impacts 
cost of sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from cost of sales of million in million of the increase related to graphite electrodes 
in the case of graphite electrodes  increased costs of million due to increased volumes  million due to the negative impact of net changes in currency exchange rates on costs and million due to continued upward pressure on energy  raw material costs particularly petroleum based raw materials and freight were partially offset by million of improvements of productivity throughout our manufacturing network and million of other cost reductions 
additionally  cost of sales increased for cathodes and related products by million 
net unfavorable impacts of currency exchange rate changes increased costs by million  changes in volumes and product mix increased costs by million and other higher costs amounted to million 
the remaining million represents higher cost of sales for our advanced synthetic graphite products  primarily due to higher volumes 
as a result  gross profit in was million  or million higher than in gross margin was of net sales in  while gross margin was of net sales in other segment 
net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from net sales of million in higher sales volumes of carbon refractory products resulted in an increase of million while higher electronic thermal management sales resulted in an increase of million 
cost of sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from cost of sales of million in the increase in cost of sales occurred primarily within our advanced carbon materials line of business  which increased million primarily due to higher sales volumes of carbon refractory products and upward pressure on energy and raw material costs 
remaining increases were primarily due to increased electronic thermal management sales 
as a result  gross profit in was million  or million higher than in gross margin was of net sales in  while gross margin was of net sales in items affecting us as a whole 
selling  administrative and other expenses increased million from million in to million in the increase was due to investments to improve global business processes  primarily new global information systems and sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
these changes in business processes resulted in higher costs of million 
in addition  we incurred higher selling expenses of million in as a result of higher sales revenue 
the net unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates increased costs by million and various other cost increases amounted to million 
these higher costs were partially offset by million of lower employee benefit costs consisting primarily of lower variable compensation expenses  and to a lesser extent  lower post retirement expense 
research and development expenses decreased million from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to both higher benefits from external funding proceeds from grants awarded to us in by the state of ohio to support fuel cell development programs and lower net costs due to our voluntary severance programs and workforce attrition 
these personnel reductions are net of increases in research and development resources dedicated to electronic thermal management development activities 
other income expense  net  was expense of million in and consisted primarily of a million loss attributable to a reduction of senior notes outstanding due to debt for equity exchanges and repurchases  million in legal  environmental and other related costs  million of fair value adjustment on interest rate caps  million of bank fees and other financing fees  million of non income taxes and million of other costs 
such costs were partially offset by other income of million of currency exchange gains  primarily associated with euro denominated intercompany loans  million of gains on the sale of assets  the majority of which pertained to a gain on the sale of our fixed assets in connection with the closure of our advanced graphite machining operations in sheffield  united kingdom  and million in other benefits 
other income expense  net  was income of million in  primarily due to currency exchange benefits of million  primarily associated with euro denominated intercompany loans 
these benefits were partially offset by other expenses  including million for bank and other financing fees  million in legal  environmental and other related costs  a million of a write down of assets  million for employee benefit curtailment and other costs  million for non income taxes in brazil and switzerland  million associated with the write off of capitalized bank fees and related debt extinguishment costs  and million in other costs 
in  we recorded a nominal net restructuring benefit 
this consisted primarily of a million charge related to severance programs and related benefits associated with the closure of our advanced graphite machining operations in sheffield  united kingdom  and a million charge associated with changes in estimates related to us voluntary and selective severance programs  offset by a million benefit in connection with the closure of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in caserta  italy consisting of a million reduction in cost estimates  occurring primarily in the synthetic graphite line of business  partially offset by a million charge related primarily to the completion of further severance agreements for employees terminated in connection with the closure 
it is also possible that we may  at any time  decide to permanently shut down our remaining graphite electrode operations in italy 
in such event  we may record additional restructuring charges and incur additional exit costs 
the following table summarizes activity relating to the accrued expense in connection with the restructuring charges 
the restructuring accrual is included in other accrued liabilities and other long term obligations on the consolidated balance sheets 
severance and related costs plant shutdown and related costs total dollars in millions balance at january  restructuring charges payments balance at december  restructuring charges payments balance at december  restructuring charges change in estimates payments and settlements  including non cash items of million balance at december  the components of this balance consist primarily of million related to the closure of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in caserta  italy  million related primarily to remaining lease payments on our former corporate headquarters  million related to the closure of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in welland  canada and million related to the closure of our advanced graphite machining operations in sheffield  united kingdom 
we expect to make million of these payments by the end of with the majority of the remaining payments to be paid by the end of restructuring charges were million in and consisted of million for organizational changes and million for the closure and settlement of our us nonqualified defined benefit plan for the participating salaried workforce 
the million charge for organizational changes related to us voluntary and selective severance programs and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of employees 
the closure of our non qualified us defined benefit plan resulted in recognition of net actuarial losses of million 
in  we recorded a million impairment loss on long lived and other assets relating to the remaining fixed assets in connection with the closure of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in caserta  italy 
in  we sold land in clarksville  tennessee and received net proceeds of million 
we recorded a million net write off of the remaining book value of assets in clarksville  tennessee 
we recorded a million charge for additional potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims in the first quarter 
this charge was offset by a gain due to the refund of million million based on currency exchange rates then in effect that we received from the eu competition authority as a result of the reduction of the eu antitrust fine to million  plus accrued interest of a million which was calculated at a rate of per annum  an aggregate of about million at currency exchange rates in effect at the time the decision on our appeal thereof was issued 
we recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter relating to the eu antitrust fine 
the following table presents an analysis of interest expense for the year ended december  dollars in millions interest incurred on debt interest rate swap benefit amortization of fair value adjustments for terminated hedge instruments accelerated amortization of fair value adjustments for terminated hedge instruments due to reduction of senior notes amortization of debt issuance costs interest on doj antitrust fine interest expense average total debt outstanding was million in as compared to million in the average annual interest rate was in as compared to in these average annual rates include the benefits of our interest rate swaps  but exclude imputed interest on the doj antitrust fine  the amortization of the effective discount on the debentures  the amortization of the net proceeds from the sale of swaps and the acceleration of the amortization of gains realized from the sale of interest rate swaps due to the early extinguishment of debt from our exchange of common stock for  and repurchases of  senior notes outstanding 
we recorded interest income in of million primarily attributable to interest earned on cash proceeds from the issuance and sale of the debentures 
provision for income taxes was a charge of million in as compared to a charge of million in the effective income tax rate was in the higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to the implementation of a standard tax election the special tax election that accelerated approximately million of taxable income in the us that resulted in the utilization of approximately million in deferred tax assets  of which approximately million were existing foreign tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
this resulted in tax expense that was million higher in than if we had not made this election 
the effective rate in was also impacted by a benefit from the eu competition authority refund  which was non taxable in the us  and by nondeductible expenses associated with certain restructuring charges 
the effective income tax rate was not meaningful in because we incurred income tax expense of million  even though we recognized a loss from continuing operations of million  primarily due to tax expense of million associated with nondeductible antitrust related charges and an additional million from adjustments increasing the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the effective income tax rate was in and in  in each case excluding the impact of restructuring charges  antitrust charges or benefits  and the tax expense resulting from the special tax election 
the american jobs creations act of the jobs act could provide a future benefit of lowering the effective us tax rate on certain qualifying us manufacturing production activities 
we are currently in the process of assessing the impact of any potential benefit from the jobs act 
during  we recorded a million gain from the sale of our non strategic composite tooling business 
the discontinued business recorded a net income from operations of million in compared to net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from net sales of million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher net sales in our synthetic graphite and advanced carbon materials lines of business 
cost of sales of million in represented an million  or  increase from cost of sales of million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher sales volumes 
gross profit of million in represented a increase from gross profit of million in gross margin increased to of net sales in from in synthetic graphite segment 
net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from net sales of million in  primarily due to higher sales volume of graphite electrodes and higher average graphite electrode sales revenue per metric ton 
volume of graphite electrodes sold was  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in the higher volume of graphite electrodes sold represented an increase of million in net sales 
the increase was a result of stronger demand for graphite electrodes primarily in the united states and europe 
average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes in was  as compared to the average in of  the higher average sales revenue per metric ton represented an increase of million in net sales 
the increase was primarily due to net changes in currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  increases in graphite electrode prices 
net sales of cathodes increased in by  or million  from net sales of million in the increase was primarily due to the net positive impact of changes in currency exchange rates  partially offset by lower sales volume and lower average sales price 
cost of sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from cost of sales of million in  primarily due to the higher sales volume of graphite electrodes 
gross profit in was million  or million higher than in the increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher graphite electrode net sales and improved productivity from higher operating levels throughout the production network  and the net positive impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
these improvements were partially offset by higher freight  energy and other raw materials costs 
gross margin was of net sales in  higher than the of net sales in other segment 
net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase from net sales of million in  primarily due to higher volume of refractories sold by our advanced carbon materials line of business 
cost of sales of million in represented an million  or  increase from cost of sales of million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily related to higher sales volume in our advanced carbon materials line of business  higher energy costs and changes in product mix  partially offset by improved productivity from higher operating levels 
gross profit in was million a gross margin of of net sales as compared to gross profit in of million a gross margin of of net sales 
items affecting us as a whole 
research and development was million in  a decrease of million from the decrease was primarily due to cost savings resulting from our voluntary and selective severance programs 
selling  administrative and other expenses were million in  an increase of million from in  we recorded higher variable incentive compensation expense and incurred higher costs from continued strengthening of the euro in and the continued implementation of global work process changes and information systems 
these higher costs were partially offset by cost savings from our voluntary and selective severance programs 
in addition  in  we benefited from a one time reduction in franchise and other taxes associated with the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries 
other income expense  net  was income of million in  primarily due to currency exchange benefits of million  which were primarily associated with euro denominated intercompany loans 
these benefits were partially offset by other expenses  including primarily million for bank and other financing fees  million in legal  environmental and other related costs  a million write down of assets  million for employee benefit curtailment and other costs  million for non income taxes in brazil and switzerland  million associated with the write off of capitalized bank fees and related debt extinguishment costs and million in other costs 
other income expense  net  was income of million in  primarily due to currency exchange benefits of million  which were primarily associated with euro denominated intercompany loans 
these benefits were partially offset by other expenses  including primarily million for bank fees and other financing fees  million in legal  environmental and other related costs  million for global realignment  million associated with the write off of capitalized bank fees and related debt extinguishment costs  million associated with the curtailment of employee benefit plans and other costs and million in various other expenses 
we recorded million of restructuring charges in  consisting of million for organizational changes and million for the closure and settlement of our us non qualified defined benefit plan for the participating salaried workforce 
the million charge for organizational changes related to us voluntary and selective severance programs and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of employees 
the closure of our non qualified us defined benefit plan resulted in recognition of net actuarial losses of million 
we recorded million of restructuring charges in the charges related primarily to the mothballing of graphite electrode manufacturing operations in italy 
this charge included estimated pension  severance and other related employee benefit costs for employees and other costs related to the mothballing 
at the end of  we announced the permanent closure of the majority of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in italy 
we recorded a million impairment loss on long lived and other assets relating to the remaining fixed assets at our graphite electrode manufacturing facility in italy in connection with such closure 
in  we sold land in clarksville  tennessee and received net proceeds of million 
we recorded a million net write off of the remaining book value of assets at this site 
in  we recorded a million impairment loss on our long lived carbon electrode assets in columbia  tennessee  a million impairment loss on our investment in our venture with jilin and a million impairment loss on available for sale securities 
we recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter relating to the eu antitrust fine 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in average total debt outstanding was million in as compared to million in the average annual interest rate was in as compared to in these average annual rates for include million of interest rate benefit from our interest rate swaps  but exclude imputed interest on the doj antitrust fine  million of amortization of the net proceeds of million with respect to the sale of swaps and a million credit to interest expense from the acceleration of the amortization of gains realized from the sale of interest rate swaps due to the early extinguishment of debt from our exchanges of common stock for  or repurchases of  senior notes during provision for income taxes was a charge of million in as compared to a benefit of million in the effective income tax rate was not meaningful in because we incurred income tax expense of million  even though we recognized a loss from continuing operations of million  primarily due to tax expense of million associated with non deductible antitrust related charges and an additional million from adjustments increasing the deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the effective income tax rate was a benefit of in  million higher than if taxed at the us federal rate  primarily due to higher state tax benefits of million and certain other benefits of million primarily associated with the impact of impairment losses on long lived and other assets and restructuring charges  partially offset by tax expense of million from adjustments increasing the deferred tax asset valuation allowances and million from the impact of dividends of foreign earnings 
the effective income tax rate was in and about in  in each case excluding the impact of impairment losses on long lived and other assets  restructuring charges and the charge related to the eu antitrust fine 
during  we recorded a million gain from the sale of our non strategic composite tooling business 
the discontinued business recorded a net income from operations of million in and as a result of the changes described above  net loss was million in as compared to net loss of million in effects of inflation we incur costs in the us and each of the six us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by the effects of inflation on our costs incurred in each of these countries 
see currency translation and transactions for a further discussion of highly inflationary countries 
during the past three years  we experienced higher freight  energy and other raw material costs primarily due to substantial increases in regional and worldwide market prices of natural gas and other petroleum based raw materials 
we seek to mitigate the effects of those increases on our cost of sales through improved operating efficiencies  higher prices for our products and ongoing cost savings  and  in some cases  fixed price or derivative hedging contracts 
we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into  natural gas hedge derivative contracts to effectively fix our direct and indirect natural gas cost exposure in north america of direct worldwide exposure 
in addition  we have in the past entered into and may in the future enter into  short duration fixed rate purchase contracts with certain of our natural gas suppliers in order to mitigate seasonal increases in our natural gas costs 
we currently do not have any natural gas derivative contracts 
except as described above  we did not experience significant inflation with respect to our costs 
we cannot assure you that future increases in our costs will not occur or exceed the rate of inflation or the amounts  if any  by which we may be able to increase prices for our products 
currency translation and transactions we account for our non us subsidiaries under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
accordingly  except for highly inflationary countries  the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes 
foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders deficit and identified as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated 
highly inflationary economies are defined as having cumulative inflation of about or more over a period of three calendar years 
in general  the financial statements of foreign operations in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency of their economic environments were the dollar and translation gains and losses relating to these foreign operations are included in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations rather than as part of stockholders deficit on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have subsidiaries in russia  mexico  brazil and other countries which have had in the past  and may have in the future highly inflationary economies 
we account for our mexican subsidiary using the dollar as its functional currency  regardless of mexico s inflationary status  because its sales and purchases are predominantly dollar denominated 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses as part of other income expense  net 
significant changes in currency exchange rates impacting us are described under effects of changes in currency exchange rates and results of operations items affecting us as a whole 
foreign currency translation adjustments increased stockholders deficit by million in and decreased stockholders deficit by million in and million in effects of changes in currency exchange rates we incur costs in dollars and the currency of each of the six non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility  and we sell our products in multiple currencies 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by changes in currency exchange rates affecting these currencies relative to the dollar and  to a limited extent  each other 
when the currencies of non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
this effect is  however  partially offset by the cost of petroleum coke  a principal raw material used by us  which is priced in dollars 
in certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities  and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets  we sell in currencies other than the dollar 
accordingly  when these currencies increase or decline in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
many of the non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic changes  which have impacted currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales  cost of sales or net income 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to mitigate any adverse effects of such changes 
during  the brazilian real declined about  the south african rand increased about and the euro increased about relative to the dollar 
during  the average exchange rate of the euro and the south african rand increased about and  respectively  when compared to the average exchange rate for during  the average exchange rate for the brazilian real and the mexican peso declined about and  respectively  when compared to the average exchange rate for during  the average exchange rate of the euro  south african rand  and brazilian real increased about  and  respectively  when compared to the average exchange rate for the mexican peso declined about when compared to the average exchange rate for in the case of net sales of graphite electrodes  the impact of these events was a reduction of about million in  an increase of about million in and an increase of about million in in the case of cost of sales of graphite electrodes  the impact of these events was a reduction of about million in  an increase of about million in and an increase of about million in we have non dollar denominated intercompany loans between graftech finance and some of our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   the aggregate principal amount of these loans was million based on currency exchange rates in effect at december  
these loans are subject to remeasurement gains and losses due to changes in currency exchange rates 
a portion of these loans are deemed to be essentially permanent and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders deficit section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the balance of these loans are deemed to be temporary and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
in  we had a net total of million in currency gains  including million of exchange gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency 
in  we had a net total of million in currency gains  including million of exchange gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency 
in  we had a net total of million of currency gains  including million of exchange gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency 
to manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we use various financial instruments as described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of funds have consisted principally of invested capital  cash flow from operations and debt and equity financings 
our uses of those funds have consisted principally of debt reduction  capital expenditures  payment of fines  liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims  payment of restructuring costs and other obligations and operating costs 
we are highly leveraged and have other substantial obligations 
at december   we had total debt of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and a stockholders deficit of million 
in addition  we have historically factored a substantial portion of our accounts receivable and used the proceeds to reduce our debt 
certain of our subsidiaries sold receivables totaling million in  million in and million in if we had not sold such receivables  our accounts receivable and our debt would have been about million higher at december  and unchanged at december  we have used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the debentures to replace the cash previously provided by such factoring 
we use cash and cash equivalents  funds available under the revolving facility  subject to continued compliance with the financial covenants and representations under the credit agreement  as well as monthly or quarterly cash flow from operations as our primary sources of liquidity 
at december   the revolving facility provided for maximum borrowings of up to million million  based on currency exchange rates in effect at december  
at december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the revolving facility and had no outstanding balance under the revolving facility with million after consideration of outstanding letters of credit and at currency exchange rates in effect at december  fully available 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with financial covenants in on february   we completed a substantial amendment and restatement of the credit agreement to effect a refinancing of the revolving facility 
see financing transactions above for information about the refinancing 
at december   or million of our total debt  excluding the fair value adjustments to debt and unamortized bond premium  had effectively been converted to variable rate obligations 
we have interest rate swaps that effectively convert the fixed rate debt represented by the senior notes into variable rate debt based on the six month libor rate as of the date of payment plus  calculated in arrears 
at december   we had swaps for a notional amount of million million of which was designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of the related senior notes  called a fair value hedge 
at december   we also had interest rate caps for a total notional amount of million through august these instruments effectively cap our interest rate exposure  represented by the net impact of our swaps on the senior notes  to no greater than per annum 
at december   the revolving facility had an effective interest rate of  our million principal amount of senior notes had an effective rate of ie  a fixed rate of  effectively swapped to a variable rate of the libor plus and our million principal amount of debentures had a fixed rate of 
we estimate that we will have interest expense of approximately million for we continue to implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize interest expense and optimize the risk in our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations as described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report 
deleveraging actions 
we completed over million in deleveraging actions in these actions consisted of sales of non strategic assets that generated net proceeds of million  including the sale of our non strategic composite tooling business for million which includes a working capital adjustment of million  the sale of interest rate swaps for net cash proceeds of million  the exchange of common stock for million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and the public offering of shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
virtually all of such proceeds were used to reduce debt 
in  we completed over million in deleveraging actions 
these actions consisted of the exchange of common stock for million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  the purchase of million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes  the sale of our plant  property and equipment held by our subsidiary in the united kingdom for net proceeds of million and the sale of certain investments for net proceeds of million 
such proceeds were used primarily to reduce debt and other obligations 
long term contractual  commercial and other obligations and commitments 
the following tables summarize our long term contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december  payment due by period total year ending december two years ending december two years ending december years ending after december dollars in millions contractual and other obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations a total contractual obligations a estimated liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims b postretirement  pension and related benefits c interest d other long term obligations total contractual and other obligations a b c  other commercial commitments lines of credit e letters of credit guarantees total other commercial commitments a effective april  we entered into a ten year service contract with cgi group inc cgi valued at that time at million million of which is the unconditional purchase obligation at december  included in the above table 
pursuant to this contract  cgi became the delivery arm for our global information services  including the design and implementation of our global information and advanced manufacturing and demand planning processes  using people soft enterprise one formerly known as jd edwards one world software 
through this contract  we are seeking to leverage the resources of cgi and transform our information technology service capability into an efficient  high quality enabler for our global supply chain initiatives as well as a contributor to our cost reduction activities 
under the outsourcing provisions of this contract  cgi manages our data center services  networks  desktops  telecommunications and legacy systems 
in the third quarter  we entered into a ten year outsourcing contract with cgi valued at that time at million 
pursuant to this contract  cgi became the delivery arm for our finance and accounting business process services  including accounts receivable and accounts payable activities 
cgi also provides various related analytical services such as general accounting  cost accounting and financial analysis activities 
such amounts are excluded from the above table as these amounts do not include an unconditional purchase obligation 
we are dependent on cgi for these services 
a failure by cgi to provide any of these services to us in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
b consists of the outstanding balance of the doj antitrust fine 
c represents estimated postretirement  pension and related benefits obligations based on actuarial calculations 
d amounts assume no decrease in interest payments from interest rate management activities eg  swaps and exclude the accounting for deferred financing costs or gains on the sale of hedge instruments 
payments assume senior notes with a fixed rate of interest of  mature on february  and the debentures with a fixed rate of interest of effectively mature on january  e local lines of credit are established by our foreign subsidiaries for working capital purposes and are not part of the revolving facility 
cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
as a result of our significant leverage and other substantial obligations  our business strategies include efforts to enhance our capital structure by further reducing our gross obligations 
accordingly  we have placed the highest priority on accelerating the amount and speed of cash generated every day 
our efforts include leveraging our unique global manufacturing network by driving higher utilization rates and more productivity from our existing assets  accelerating commercialization initiatives across all of our businesses and realizing other global efficiencies 
during the four years prior to  we had positive annual cash flow from operations  excluding payments in connection with restructurings and antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims 
from through the first quarter of  we had negative cash flow from operations excluding those payments  primarily driven by higher uses of cash for funding working capital requirements 
since the second quarter of  cash flow from operations was a positive million  excluding payments made in connection with restructuring and antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims 
typically  the first quarter of each year resulted in neutral or negative cash flow from operations excluding payments in connection with restructurings  antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims and the impact of the reduction of factoring of accounts receivable due to various factors 
these factors included customer order patterns  fluctuations in working capital requirements and payment of variable compensation with respect to the immediately preceding year 
typically  the other three quarters resulted in positive cash flow from operations before such exclusions 
the third quarter tended to produce relatively less positive cash flow from operations primarily as a result of scheduled plant shutdowns by our customers for vacations 
our cash flow from operations before such exclusions in the first and third quarters typically is adversely impacted by the semi annual interest payments on the senior notes and by the semi annual interest payments on the debentures  which began in july the second and fourth quarters correspondingly benefit from the absence of such interest payments 
as part of our cash management activities  we seek to manage accounts receivable credit risk and collections  and payment of accounts payable to seek to maximize our free cash at any given time and minimize accounts receivable losses 
in addition  we have historically factored a portion of our accounts receivable and used the proceeds to reduce our debt 
in  we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the debentures to replace cash provided by factoring of accounts receivable 
certain of our subsidiaries sold receivables totaling million in  million in at a cost of approximately to per annum of the amount of receivables sold and million in at a cost of approximately to per annum of the amount of receivables sold 
if we had not sold such receivables  our accounts receivable and our debt would have been about million higher at december  and unchanged at december  in addition  careful management of credit risk over at least the past three years has allowed us to avoid significant accounts receivable losses notwithstanding the poor financial condition of many of our potential and existing customers 
in order to seek to minimize our credit risks  we reduced our sales of  or refused to sell except for cash on delivery  graphite electrodes to some customers and potential customers in the us and  to a limited extent  elsewhere 
our unrecovered trade receivables worldwide were only of global net sales during the last years 
we cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future 
we use cash and cash equivalents  funds available under the revolving facility and cash flow from operations as our primary sources of liquidity 
we believe that our business strategies will continue to improve the amount and speed of cash generated from operations under current economic conditions 
improvements in cash flow from operations resulting from these strategies are being partially offset by associated cash implementation costs  while they are being implemented 
we also believe that our planned sales of non strategic assets together with these improvements in cash flow from operations should allow us to reduce our debt and other obligations over the long term 
we may from time to time and at any time exchange or purchase senior notes in open market or privately negotiated transactions  opportunistically on terms that we believe to be favorable 
these exchanges or purchases may be effected for cash from cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under the revolving facility or new credit facilities  or proceeds from sale of debt or equity securities or assets  common stock or other equity or debt securities  or a combination thereof 
we will evaluate any such transaction in light of then prevailing market conditions and our then current and prospective liquidity and capital resources  including projected and potential needs and prospects for access to capital markets 
any such transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  be material 
our high leverage and other substantial obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity 
cash flow from operations services payment of our debt and other obligations thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes 
our leverage and these obligations make us more vulnerable to economic downturns in the event that these obligations are greater or timing of payment is sooner than expected 
our ability to service our debt and other obligations as they come due  including maintaining compliance with the financial covenants and the representations regarding absence of material adverse changes under the revolving facility  is dependent on our future performance  which is subject to various factors  including certain factors beyond our control such as changes in supply  demand and other conditions affecting our industry  changes in global and regional economic conditions  changes in interest and currency exchange rates and inflation in raw material  energy and other costs 
the revolving facility requires us to  among other things  comply with financial covenants relating to specified minimum interest coverage and maximum net senior secured debt leverage ratios 
a failure to comply with such covenants  unless waived  would be a default under the revolving facility 
this would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the revolving facility and terminate their commitments to extend credit under the revolving facility 
an acceleration of maturity of the revolving facility would permit the holders of the senior notes to accelerate the maturity of the senior notes and the holders of the debentures to accelerate the maturity of the debentures 
if we were unable to repay our debt to the lenders and holders or otherwise obtain a waiver from the lenders and holders  the lenders and holders could proceed against the collateral securing the revolving facility and the senior notes  respectively  and exercise all other rights available to them  and we could be required to undertake significant actions which may be inconsistent with our plans or adverse to our stockholders to raise the funds necessary for repayment 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain any such waiver or take any of such actions on favorable terms or at all 
we believe that the long term fundamentals of our business continue to be sound 
accordingly  although we cannot assure you that such will be the case  we believe that  based on our expected cash flow from operations  our existing capital resources  and taking into account our working capital needs and our efforts to reduce costs  improve efficiencies and product quality  generate growth and cash flow and maximize funds available to meet our debt service and other obligations  we will be able to manage our liquidity to permit us to service our debt and meet our obligations when due 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with financial covenants in related party transactions 
we have not  since january   engaged in or been a party to any material transactions with affiliates or related parties other than transactions with our subsidiaries including carbone savoie and aet  compensatory transactions with directors and officers including employee benefits  stock option and restricted stock grants  compensation deferral  executive employee loans and stock purchases and transactions with our owned venture with jilin in china 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments

o minimum required purchase commitments under our information technology outsourcing services agreement with cgi described under long term contractual  commercial and other obligations and commitments that  at december   totaled approximately million in each year and about million in the aggregate and at december   totaled approximately million in each year and about million in the aggregate 
o factoring accounts receivable as described under cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
we have not been  since january   affiliated with or related to any special purpose entity other than graftech finance  our wholly owned and consolidated finance subsidiary 
cash flows 
in general  during  and  we used cash in operating activities including payments related to restructurings and antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims as well as for capital expenditures 
financing for these uses was provided primarily by net proceeds from our public offerings of common stock in  our incurrence of long term and short term debt and proceeds from sales of non strategic assets and interest rate swaps 
we believe that we will have a net source of cash from operating and investing activities in including payments related to restructurings and the doj antitrust fine

our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
however  the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical 
reliance on estimates 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we use and rely on estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for restructuring charges and contingencies  tax valuation allowances  evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and postretirement benefit obligations and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
estimates require us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our estimates for these matters are reasonable  if the actual amount is significantly different than the estimated amount  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
employee benefit plans 
we sponsor various retirement and pension plans  including defined benefit and defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans that cover most employees worldwide 
accounting for these plans requires assumptions as to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  expected salary increases and health care cost trend rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
financial instruments 
we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
we routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage well defined currency exchange rate risks and interest rate risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
since the counterparties to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
accounting for financial instruments requires us to make judgments about the value of those instruments at specified dates 
while we believe that our estimates of values are reasonable  if the actual values are significantly different than the estimated values  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
derivative liability associated with our debentures due in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas  the redemption option and its make whole provision the redemption make whole option contained in the terms governing our convertible debenture due  qualified as an embedded derivative that was not clearly and closely related to the characteristics of the debenture upon issuance 
since the redemption make whole option does not currently qualify for any scope exception within sfas  it is required by sfas to be accounted for separately from the debt instrument and recorded as derivative financial instruments 
the embedded derivative financial instrument was classified as a derivative liability upon issuance and is included in the other long term obligations in the consolidated balance sheet 
at each balance sheet date  we adjust the redemption make whole option to its estimated fair value 
at january   the estimated fair value of our derivative liability was million 
at december   the estimated fair value of our derivative liability was million 
we estimate the fair value of the redemption make whole option using a financial model that uses several assumptions including historical stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  remaining maturity  and the closing price of our common stock to determine estimated fair value of our derivative liability 
we believe that the assumption that has the greatest impact on the determination of fair value is the closing price of our common stock during each quarterly period 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies by recording an estimated loss or gain from a loss or gain contingency when information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred or a gain has become receivable at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss or gain can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as those relating to environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss or gain from a contingency is significantly different from the estimated loss or gain  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
impairments of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the discounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of the discounted future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainties and assumptions 
if the actual value is significantly less than the estimated fair value  our assets may be overstated 
future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge o new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over our current technology  o significant negative economic or industry trends  o changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets  o significant increases or decreases in our cost of capital  and o future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
inventories 
we record the value of inventories at the lower of cost or market  and periodically review the book value of products and product lines to determine if they are properly valued 
we also periodically review the composition of our inventories and seek to identify slow moving inventories 
in connection with those reviews  we seek to identify products that may not be properly valued and assess the ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost 
if it is determined that cost is less than market value  then cost is used for inventory valuation 
generally  we do not experience issues with obsolete inventory due to the nature of our products 
if the actual value is significantly less than the recorded value  our assets may be overstated 
accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to make the following assessments o estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction 
o estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as lease revenue and related depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we include within our consolidated balance sheets 
o assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  if we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
if our estimates are incorrect  our assets or liabilities may be overstated or understated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commercial energy rates 
we routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage well defined risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described below 
since the counterparties to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from floating rate long term debt tied to libor or euro libor 
our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from o raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  o investments in and intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries  to the extent denominated in currencies other than local currencies  and o sales made by our subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies 
our exposure to changes in energy costs results primarily from the purchase of natural gas and electricity for use in our manufacturing operations 
interest rate management 
we implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize our interest expense and optimize the risk in our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
use of these initiatives is allowed under the senior notes and the credit agreement 
we have interest rate swaps that effectively convert fixed rate debt represented by the senior notes into variable rate debt based on the six month libor rate as of the date of payment  plus  calculated in arrears 
at december  and we had swaps for a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december   million out of our total outstanding million notional amount of interest rate swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of the related debt called a fair value hedge 
the related debt for our swaps is the senior notes  of which million were outstanding at year end 
at december  and excluding the offsetting value of our interest rate caps the principal value of our debt was reduced by million and million  respectively  as a result of our current fair value hedges 
these market values and any changes in the market values of those interest rate swaps  excluding changes in value resulting from accrued interest payable or receivable from the counterparty  are currently recorded as part of other long term obligations on the consolidated balance sheets 
accrued interest receivable or payable to the counterparty is recorded as a component of interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
at december   the remaining million of our interest rate swaps were not designated as hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of any specific debt instrument 
any changes in the market value of those swaps are recorded in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statement of operations 
in  the mark to market impact of the undesignated swaps was nil 
in february  we sold all million of those undesignated swaps 
see note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements 
all of our swaps are valued monthly  and we are required to provide cash collateral to the counterparty ies to the extent that the fair market value of the swap liability  net of the fair market value of our interest rate caps  exceeds a specific threshold 
at december   all of our swaps were with one counterparty and this threshold was million 
we were not required to post any cash collateral at december  when we sell a fair value hedge swap  the gain or loss is amortized as a credit or charge to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes 
when we effectively reduce the outstanding principal amount of the senior notes through debt for equity exchanges  repurchases or otherwise  the related portion of such credit or charge is accelerated and recorded in the period in which such reduction occurs 
at december  and the principal value of our debt was increased by million and million  respectively  as a result of gains realized from previously sold swaps 
the net impact of current and terminated hedge instruments was a million and a million increase in the fair value of our debt at december  and  respectively  and was recorded on the consolidated balance sheets on the line entitled fair value adjustments for hedge instruments 
interest rate swaps reduced our interest expense by million in interest rate swaps reduced our interest expense by million in the reduction was due to million of benefit from current interest rate swaps  million of amortization of fair value adjustments for previously sold interest rate swaps and million due to acceleration of the amortization of fair value adjustments for previously sold interest rate swaps 
interest rate swaps reduced our interest expense by million in the reduction was due to the benefit from current interest rate swaps in the amount of million  million of amortization of fair value adjustments for previously sold interest rate swaps and million due to acceleration of the amortization of fair value adjustments for previously sold interest rate swaps 
we enter into agreements with financial institutions that are intended to limit  or cap  our exposure to incurrence of additional interest expense due to increases in variable interest rates 
these instruments effectively cap our interest rate exposure  represented by the net impact of our swaps on the senior notes  to no greater than per annum 
at december  and  we had interest rate caps for a notional amount of million 
all of our interest rate caps are marked to market monthly 
gains and losses are recorded in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
the mark to market adjustment on caps was nil for  a million loss for and a million loss for currency rate management 
we enter into foreign currency instruments to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
these foreign currency instruments  which include  but are not limited to  forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options  attempt to hedge global currency exposures  net  relating to euro denominated debt and identifiable foreign currency receivables  payables and commitments held by our foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate 
purchased foreign currency options are instruments which give the holder the right  but not the obligation  to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates 
the result is the creation of a range in which a best and worst price is defined  while minimizing option cost 
forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at market value 
the notional amount of open foreign exchange contracts used by us to minimize foreign currency exposure against euro depreciation was nil at december  and million at december  these contracts are marked to market monthly and gains and losses are recorded in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statement of operations 
we recorded a loss of million with respect to the contracts held during and a loss of million with respect to contracts held during commercial energy rate management 
we did not have any commercial energy rate contracts outstanding at december  in  we entered into natural gas hedge derivative contracts  effectively fixing of our direct and indirect natural gas cost exposure in north america which represents about of our direct worldwide exposure 
the unrealized gain on outstanding contracts at december  amounted to million 
these contracts expired in april we currently do not have any natural gas derivative or other commercial energy rate contracts 
in addition  we have in the past entered  and may in the future enter  into short duration fixed rate purchase contracts with certain of our natural gas suppliers in order to mitigate seasonal increases in our natural gas costs 
we currently have such contracts with certain of our natural gas suppliers 
sensitivity analysis 
we used a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential effect of changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates for  and based on this analysis  a hypothetical weakening or strengthening in the dollar across all other currencies would have changed our reported gross margin for by about million  for by about million and for by about million 
in addition  based on this analysis  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points across all maturities would have increased our interest expense for  and  by about million  million and million  respectively
