overview we operate mid sized warehouse club style stores in the united states territories  foreign island countries in the pacific and the caribbean  the hawaiian islands and sonora  california 
our primary strategy is to operate in island markets  offering predominately us branded goods 
we currently operate eleven retail stores as follows two stores in each of hawaii and guam  and one store in each of st 
thomas  st 
croix  american samoa  fiji  curacao  st 
maarten and sonora  california 
our stores are patterned after the warehouse club concept  although the stores i are smaller averaging approximately  square feet vs 
large format warehouse clubs of approximately  square feet  ii generally target niche markets  mainly us territories  us island states and foreign island countries  where demographics do not support large format warehouse clubs  iii carry a wide assortment of local and ethnic food items  and iv do not charge a membership fee 
although we do not have large seasonal fluctuations in sales  the fourth quarter is typically the highest sales quarter due to additional holiday sales 
we are currently in the process of building a new st 
croix store on a parcel of land located closer to the main trade area in the center of the island than our existing store 
this new building will expand the size of our st 
croix store by about to approximately  square feet 
we expect this new store to open during the second quarter of we are currently operating in our existing location under a short term lease with our current landlord until such time as we can move into our new location 
on december   our two stores on the island of guam suffered damage from supertyphoon pongsona  resulting in the immediate closure of both stores 
our tamuning store lost its generator in the storm  but reopened shortly thereafter on december  our dededo store  however  suffered more significant damage  and had to be closed for reconstruction 
the store was rebuilt and it reopened for business on october  during fiscal  we continued to experience improvements in comparable store sales stores open for a full months and gross margin  which resulted in higher net income and earnings per share 
these improvements were due to several factors including better sourcing  pricing  and other merchandising initiatives in our stores  as well as the reopening of our dededo  guam store 
in addition  some of our markets  including guam  hawaii and st 
thomas  saw an improvement in their general economic conditions 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our net sales represented by certain consolidated income statement data 
fiscal year ended december  december  december  net sales gross margin operating expenses store general and administrative store opening operating income interest expense  net other income expense income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in fiscal of million increased  as compared to net sales of million for the comparable period in the prior year 
approximately of the increase was due to the reopening of our store in dededo  guam in october the balance of the increase was due to comparable store sales increases offset by a decline in business to business sales as compared to fiscal we expect the level of business to business activity for fiscal to be lower than fiscal  as we de emphasize such sales 
comparable store sales stores open for a full months increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal comparable store sales are calculated on stores excluding the guam market as our dededo  guam store was closed during the corresponding periods in the prior year and during those periods our tamuning  guam store benefited from the temporary closure of our dededo store 
all of our other stores experienced increased sales as compared to the prior year  primarily due to improvements in our assortment of food and general merchandise  operating improvements including better in stock inventory levels and improved economic conditions in some of our markets 
gross margin 
gross margin improved to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales resulted primarily from better sourcing  pricing and merchandising of goods in our stores and a stronger mix of retail store sales  with typically higher margins  as compared to business to business sales  which generally provide a lower gross margin but are executed at minimal direct expense 
store expenses 
store expenses increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  but remained flat as a percent of sales at of sales for both fiscal and fiscal approximately of the dollar increase in store expenses was attributable to increased expenses associated with operating eleven stores during all of fiscal as compared to ten stores for ten of the twelve months in fiscal the remainder of the dollar increase was primarily attributable to a increase in commercial insurance expense  a increase in energy utility expense and a increase in rent expense  accelerated depreciation related to the planned relocation of our st 
croix store  and higher volume related expenses such as payroll and bankcard fees 
as a percent of store sales  payroll and related costs declined in to as compared to of store sales in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a increase in compensation costs largely resulting from increased performance based awards pursuant to our incentive bonus program 
additionally  we had a increase in commercial insurance costs  partially offset by non recurring costs incurred in in connection with a million write down of idle fixed assets from previously closed stores and the acceleration of depreciation of leasehold improvements related to our corporate office move  as well as fiscal transaction costs incurred in connection with our discussions with assi  inc regarding a potential strategic business combination that did not occur 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales decreased to in fiscal  as compared to in the corresponding period in the prior year  primarily due to the leveraging of corporate expenses over increased store sales 
store opening expense 
store opening expenses were  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal store opening expense in fiscal related to costs associated with the evaluation of potential new store locations and current store relocations 
store opening expenses in fiscal primarily related to the reopening of our dededo  guam store 
we expect store opening expenses in fiscal to be slightly higher than those incurred in fiscal  as we relocate our st 
croix store 
net interest expense 
interest expense  net  decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  as borrowings on our line of credit decreased compared to the prior year 
other income expense other income of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to gains on foreign currency transactions and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceeded the permanent investments in those countries 
other income of million in fiscal included a gain of million related to the receipt of insurance reimbursements for damage to inventory and equipment sustained from the supertyphoon in guam and gains of million on foreign currency transactions and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceeded the permanent investments in those countries 
the income on foreign currency in both fiscal years was primarily attributable to appreciation in the fijian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
income tax provision 
we recorded a tax provision in fiscal of million  or of pre tax income 
the tax provision represents taxes associated with income generated in the us and us territories 
no taxes or tax benefits were provided on foreign pre tax losses in fiscal  as we cannot predict whether we will be able to generate an adequate amount of taxable income in the future to utilize such benefits 
as of december   we have foreign net operating loss carryforwards nol s of approximately million  some of which  if not utilized  will begin expiring in the year the nol s include approximately million related to curacao and st 
maarten which are not subject to expiration time limits 
our ability to utilize the nol s carryforwards is dependent upon generating taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million attributable to the million of tax benefits recorded for net operating loss carryforwards 
net income 
our net income was million  or per fully diluted share  in fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per fully diluted share  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  we experienced improvements in comparable store sales and gross margin  which resulted in higher net income and eps

the store was rebuilt and reopened on october  net sales 
net sales in fiscal of million increased as compared to net sales of million for the comparable period in the prior year 
the improvement in sales came despite the nine month closure of our dededo  guam  store and lower business to business sales in the current year  as nine of our other ten stores experienced comparable sales increases 
comparable store sales stores open for a full months increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal comparable store sales are calculated on stores excluding the guam market as our store in tamuning  guam benefited from the temporary closure of our dededo store

the income on foreign currency in both fiscal years was primarily attributable to appreciation in the fijian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
income tax provision 
we recorded a tax provision in fiscal of million  or of pre tax income 
the tax provision represents taxes associated with income generated in the us and us territories 
no taxes or tax benefits were provided on foreign pre tax losses in fiscal  as we cannot predict whether we will be able to generate an adequate amount of taxable income in the future to utilize such benefits 
as of december   we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards nol s of approximately million  which  if not utilized  will begin expiring in the year nol s in curacao and st 
maarten of approximately million are not subject to expiration time limits 
our ability to utilize the nol s carryforwards is dependent upon generating taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million attributable to the million of tax benefits recorded for net operating loss carryforwards 
we had tax credit carryforwards of million as of december   expiring between and during  we were able to utilize a portion of the tax credit carryforward 
net income 
our net income was million  or per fully diluted share  in fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per fully diluted share  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we currently finance our operations with proceeds from various credit facilities and internally generated funds 
we intend to finance the relocation of our st 
croix store  and any future relocations and new stores  either through an operating lease  a sale leaseback arrangement or by obtaining long term funding from a financial institution 
we intend to continue leasing as many of our store locations as feasible 
in those instances where a lease is not available on acceptable terms  we expect to finance our stores utilizing long term funding from a financial institution as we currently do for our st 
thomas and st 
maarten buildings 
we generated million and million of net cash from operations during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we utilized  of net cash for operations in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operations in as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in net income of million and an increase in accounts payable of million  partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory of million 
the increase in net cash provided by operations in  as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in net income of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million  and the receipt of insurance proceeds on inventory lost in the supertyphoon in guam and payments received on accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to the purchase of land in st 
croix for approximately million and costs associated with the construction of the building on this parcel of land where we plan to relocate our st 
croix store 
the relocated store will be closer to the main trade area in the center of the island than the existing store 
additionally  we intend to expand the size of the new st 
croix store by about to  square feet 
we expect to incur an additional to million for the cost of site development  the new building and equipment 
we intend to relocate our st 
croix store to this new location during the second quarter of fiscal the cash used in investing activities in primarily related to the reopening of our dededo  guam store 
the proceeds from insurance settlement received in both and relates to insurance reimbursements received on fixed assets lost in the supertyphoon in guam 
the cash used in fiscal was for general store improvements 
we currently have no plans to open stores in new markets during fiscal  but we are in the process of exploring expansion opportunities in selected markets and additional relocation opportunities for stores in existing markets 
net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to a million reduction in the balance on our line of credit and a million decrease in bank checks outstanding  partially offset by million of funds received on the sale leaseback of equipment in guam 
in fiscal  million was used to reduce the balance on our line of credit  which was offset by an increase of million in bank checks outstanding 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal was due to borrowings on our line of credit and an increase in bank checks outstanding  partially offset by reductions in the outstanding borrowings on our long term debt 
foreign currency translation resulted in a gain of  in fiscal and losses of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the foreign currency translation gains and losses are a result of the translation of our subsidiaries operating results and balance sheets from local currencies to u 
s 
dollars 
we have a line of credit with wells fargo business credit that has a three year term  expiring on april  at december   there were no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit  but there was million utilized for standby letters of credit and million set aside for other reserves 
the line of credit consists of a million committed  secured revolving credit line with a sublimit for letters of credit and bankers acceptances in the amount up to million 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to the lesser of million or the amount calculated under the borrowing base 
the borrowing base is equal to the lesser of a million or b the sum of of eligible inventory in the united states of america  plus of eligible inventory in the us virgin islands and guam  less specified reserves 
the interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit is equal to wells fargo s prime rate plus  which was at december  a fee of is charged on the unused portion of the line of credit and we are required to pay wells fargo not less than million of interest each calendar year 
the line of credit contains various covenants  including a requirement that we maintain minimum pre tax income and tangible net worth  as well as limitations on acquisitions  additional debt  changes in control and capital expenditures 
a significant portion of our cash flow is generated by our operations 
if our operating results deteriorate as a result of a decrease in customer demand  declining economic conditions in the markets in which we have stores  or pricing pressures from our customers or our competitors  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
we believe that amounts available under our various credit facilities  existing cash available for working capital purposes  and cash flow from operations will most likely be sufficient to fund our operations through the next months 
however  if such sources of liquidity are unavailable or insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to issue equity or debt securities  obtain additional credit facilities or consider alternative financing arrangements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing when needed  or that any available financing will be on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations as of december   our commitments to make future payments under long term contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years long term debt operating leases capital lease total adjusted to reflect new lease agreement entered into in february for our store in american samoa 
critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market 
we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of actual physical inventory count results 
long lived assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets  including intangibles  may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to projected future cash flows 
upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  the company recognizes an impairment loss by a charge against current operations 
foreign currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency for all our locations  except for fiji and netherlands antilles  where the local currency is the functional currency 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the applicable exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
net sales costs and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period 
adjustments resulting from this process are reported  net of taxes  as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity 
realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
the cumulative translation adjustment resulting from a net investment in a country is recognized as income or expense in the period we substantially liquidate operations in that country 
income taxes income tax expense includes us and foreign income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we apply judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized  and valuation allowances are established when necessary 
our effective tax rate is currently higher than the expected federal statutory rate because valuation allowances have been established against the tax benefits of foreign losses  as we have no assurance that we will be able to generate an adequate amount of taxable income in the future to utilize such benefits 
we are developing and implementing certain tax planning strategies  which may affect our ability to recognize some of the deferred tax assets that are currently allowed for and may ultimately change our estimate of the valuation allowance 
accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement revised  share based payment statement r 
statement r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
statement r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
statement r replaces statement  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
as originally issued in  statement established as preferable the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to the financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
we will be required to apply statement r as of the first interim reporting period that begins after june   and we plan to use the modified prospective method  effective with our third quarter of fiscal we believe that our adoption of this new accounting standard will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position  as we have a limited amount of options available for issuance in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate stores in foreign countries and have market risks associated with foreign currencies 
however  sales are primarily made in us dollars or foreign currencies with minimal trade credit extended and no borrowings exist in foreign currencies 
cash deposited from sales are remitted back to the us bank account  routinely 
we record gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceed the permanent investments in those countries in other income expense 
gains and losses are primarily attributable to appreciation and depreciation in the fijian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
we operate in three foreign countries that function under currencies other than the us dollar 
two of the these foreign countries operate under the netherland antilles guilder that has historically had an exchange rate fixed to the us dollar but there can be no assurance that this will continue 
if the netherland antilles guilder is allowed to float this would lead to an increase in foreign exchange volatility and risk which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
there is also the possibility these three foreign countries that function under currencies other than the us dollar could devalue their currency against the us dollar at any time and if this was to occur there could be a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
we have also assessed our vulnerability to interest rate risk associated with our financial instruments  including  cash and cash equivalents  lines of credit and long term debt 
due to the nature of these financial instruments  we believe that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations does not pose a material risk 
our line of credit and long term debt can be expected to vary in the future as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
we did not have any derivative financial instruments as of december
