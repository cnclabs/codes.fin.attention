item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview since our inception in january  we have been engaged in the development of hemodialysis products and services for patients suffering from esrd 
we have developed an automated personal hemodialysis system  known as the aksys phd personal hemodialysis system the phd system  which is designed to enable patients to perform frequent hemodialysis at alternate sites such as their own homes and to thereby improve clinical outcomes  reduce total esrd treatment costs and enhance the quality of life of patients 
during the quarter ended september   we commenced commercial activities and were no longer considered to be in the development stage 
we have not been profitable since we commenced operations and we expect to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future 
on march   we announced receipt of fda clearance to market the phd system in the united states 
the fda clearance had no restrictions and included authorization to use the product in the home 
the fda required k clearance prior to the commercialization of the phd system in the united states 
on october   we announced receipt of ec certification for ce mark approval pursuant to the medical device directive of the european economic area 
the certification approved the phd system for home use 
such approval was required prior to the commercialization of the phd system in the european economic area 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  and its related interpretations 
revenue is recognized when the following conditions exist there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered and installed or services and supplies have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
during the quarter ended september   we adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of installation of the phd system 
services and supplies are sold to customers in a monthly service agreement  not dependent on service time incurred or materials used 
services and supplies revenue is recognized uniformly over the term of the agreement 
we also lease the phd system to customers on a short term basis months or less and long term basis up to months and recognize revenue on these operating leases on a straight line basis over the lease term 
we have no contracts with distributors and sell our product directly to our customers through our own sales force 
accrued liabilities and contingencies we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recorded as accrued liabilities and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors  such as changing business conditions and management expectations  that we believe to be reasonable to determine the amount of accrued liabilities and contingencies to be recorded 
if actual results differ from these estimates  additional expenses might be recorded 
net deferred tax assets valuation we record our net deferred tax assets in the amount that we expect to realize based on projected future taxable income 
in assessing the appropriateness of our valuation  assumptions and estimates are required such as our ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase our income in the period such determination was made 
given our historical losses and uncertainty with respect to our ability to generate taxable income  we have established a full valuation allowance at december  and to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
the weighted average cost of inventory approximates the first in  first out method fifo for all inventories 
management performs periodic assessments to determine the existence of obsolete inventory or to determine if there has been a decline in the market value of inventory  and records necessary provisions to reduce such inventory to the net realizable value 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  contractual cash obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt short term line of credit operating leases royalties purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have a contractural obligation with the manufacturer of the phd system to purchase additional parts at a total cost of approximately million 
we have placed a deposit with the vendor for million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in applicable sec rules  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors

and its affiliates 
the forward looking statements made in this report speak only as of the date that they are made 
we do not undertake to publicly update or revise our forward looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results or events expressed or implied therein will not be realized 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net loss for the year ended december  was million per share  compared with million per share  for the year ended december  our cost to manufacture the phd system exceeds its selling price  and our cost to service and supply active machines on a per unit basis exceeds the per unit revenue generated by those machines 
the first full year in which we recorded sales was as volumes increased from seven active machines at year end  to active machines at year end and active machines at year end  our net loss has also increased 
we expect to rely primarily on reductions in the production and service costs of the phd system in order to realize a positive gross margin on sales 
we completed cost reductions to the phd system in late that reduced the cost of the machine from approximately  to approximately  we plan to redesign the phd system  and when the new design is manufactured  we anticipate it will have a cost below the current selling price 
we continue to work diligently to achieve manufacturing and service cost reductions on the phd system 
however  these cost reduction plans and efforts may not be successful  and we may not be able to achieve a positive gross margin on product sales or service of the phd system in the future 
additional details as to our financial performance are discussed below 
clinic partnership agreements 
we added clinic partnership agreements in the year ended december   bringing the total number of signed partnership agreements to a typical agreement provides for an initial market assessment and allows a clinic to purchase or lease on a long term basis multiple units over time  with the option to purchase service and supplies at an additional charge

background to the litigation 
in april  we entered into an agreement with mr 
sacane and durus capital relating to shares of our common stock they then controlled through the durus fund the april agreement 
we entered into the april agreement after we learned that certain of the defendants had accumulated a position in our common stock in excess of the ownership level that would potentially trigger our shareholder rights agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the april agreement  mr 
sacane and durus capital represented that they then owned  shares approximately of our outstanding common stock  crossed the ownership level inadvertently  and held this investment in the company in the ordinary course of business and not for the purpose or with the effect of changing or influencing the control of the company 
in addition  they agreed to reduce their holdings to below ownership over a two year period and not to purchase any additional shares of our common stock until such time as their ownership was less than of the shares then outstanding and thereafter not in excess of without the consent of our board of directors

the authority granted by the proxies continues until the defendants aggregate ownership of our common stock decreases below  provided that once the defendants aggregate ownership of our common stock decreases below of the outstanding stock  the authority granted by the proxies will apply only to those shares of common stock owned by the defendants in the aggregate in excess of of our outstanding common stock 
based on information contained in a schedule d filed by the durus fund with the sec  we believe the durus fund owns  shares of our common stock which includes  shares issuable upon exercise of immediately exercisable warrants  representing approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
mr 
sacane  durus capital and durus capital na have represented to us that they do not own any shares of our common stock  other than indirect interests in the shares of our common stock owned by the durus fund  and that they do not have voting or dispositive power over any of the shares owned by the durus fund or the artal fund 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  a representative of the durus fund will have the opportunity to meet with our board of directors before or after each regular board meeting 
in addition  we have amended our rights agreement to conditionally exempt the defendants therefrom 
as part of the settlement  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the durus fund and the artal fund whereby we agreed to use reasonable best efforts to register the shares held by them in one or more shelf registration statements and to keep these registration statements s effective for two years the effective period  subject to extension in the event that we issue a blackout notice pursuant to the terms of the agreement in which case the effectiveness period will be extended by the duration of such blackout  the sec imposes a stop order on the registration statement s or the registration statement s otherwise become ineffective in which case the effectiveness period will be extended by the duration of such stop order or period of ineffectiveness  we experience a material adverse event related to certain fda matters or similar government regulatory matters in which case the effectiveness period will be extended for up to days or we effect the registration of our common stock for our own account or the account of another third party in which case the effectiveness period will be extended for up to days 
we filed a registration statement pursuant to the registration rights agreement on april  the sec declared this registration statement effective on may  the durus fund has agreed that it will reduce its ownership of our common stock over time and that its position in our common stock will be under by the end of the effective period 
during the first year of the effective period  we may not effect the registration of any shares of our common stock without the durus fund s consent 
we have agreed to pay the first  of expenses associated with the registration of the durus fund s and the artal fund s shares 
the durus fund and the artal fund will pay all fees and expenses of their counsel  all underwriting discounts and commissions  and any of our expenses in excess of  the registration rights agreement also contains customary indemnification provisions 
we have also entered into a note purchase agreement with the durus fund and the artal fund whereby the durus fund and the artal fund purchased approximately million and million  respectively  of unsecured subordinated promissory notes the notes from us 
the notes are subordinated and junior in right of payment to all of our creditors  including trade creditors  and do not bear interest 
we may repay the notes in cash at any time 
after the later of august  and the first trading day on which the holders of the notes own less than of our then outstanding common stock  we may repay the notes in stock 
any stock issued in repayment of the notes will be subject to registration rights pursuant to the registration rights agreement 
the notes will become due and payable one year after the later of the two dates above and in no event later than february  if we elect to repay the notes in stock  the number of shares that we must deliver for payment will be determined based on the average of the closing prices of our common stock on the nasdaq national market over the twenty trading days preceding our election to repay in stock 
the notes will also become due and payable in cash upon a change of control 
in the event of a change of control repayment  in addition to repayment of the then outstanding principal amount of the notes  we are required to pay to the holders of the notes an amount equal to of the consideration received by a the company in the case of an asset sale transaction constituting a change of control net of corporate taxes  transaction expenses and indebtedness of the company or b our stockholders and the holders of the notes in a merger or other type of transaction constituting a change of control  less the principal amount repaid 
the foregoing summaries of the settlement agreement  the amendment to our rights agreement  the registration rights agreement and the note purchase agreement do not purport to be complete and are subject to  and qualified in their entirety by reference to  complete copies of these documents filed as exhibits to our current report on form k filed with the sec on february  and deemed to be incorporated herein in their entirety 
financing needs we estimate that during fiscal we will spend approximately to million for operations  including us and international commercialization activities of the phd system 
we expect to continue to invest in commercialization of the phd system 
we believe that cash and marketable investments of million as of december  are sufficient to finance our commercial and operating plans through december  we currently have no committed sources of  or other arrangements with respect to  additional financing 
our future funding needs will depend on many factors  including the timing and costs associated with continued progress in research and development  manufacturing scale up  increased sales and marketing activities  the cost involved in filing and enforcing patent claims and the status of competitive products 
in the event that our plans change  our assumptions change or prove inaccurate or we are unable to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms  we could be required to seek additional financing 
the additional capital required may not be available on acceptable terms or may not be available at all 
we have not generated taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income were approximately million 
because we have experienced ownership changes  future utilization of the carryforwards may be limited in any one fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before becoming available to reduce federal income tax liabilities 
given our historical losses and uncertainty with respect to our ability to generate taxable income  management has established a full valuation allowance at december  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that the fair value of stock options be recorded in the results of operations beginning no later than july  the fasb has concluded that companies could adopt the new standard in one of two ways the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method 
using the modified prospective transition method  a company would recognize share based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date 
using the modified retrospective method  a company would recognize employee compensation cost for periods presented prior to the adoption of the proposed standard in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 that is  an entity would recognize employee compensation cost in the amounts reported in the pro forma disclosures provided in accordance with sfas no 
a company would not be permitted to make any changes to those amounts upon adoption of the proposed standard unless those changes represent a correction of an error and are disclosed accordingly 
for periods after the date of adoption of the proposed standards  the modified prospective transition method described above would be applied 
aksys has not determined the effect of the new standard on earnings  however  expense under the new standard could be higher 
the effect of adopting the new rules on reported diluted earnings per share is dependent on the number of options granted in the future  the terms of those awards and their fair values  and therefore the effect on diluted earnings per share could change 
aksys has not determined an adoption date and has not determined whether it would adopt prospectively  or retrospectively to january  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it also requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  the statement will be effective on january  the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results from operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our investments are not made for trading purposes 
our investments are generally made in us government and federal agency bonds and high grade commercial paper and corporate bonds 
interest rate risk with respect to our investments is not significant as substantially all of such investments are in short term us dollar cash equivalents  which are by their nature less sensitive to interest rate movements  or invested in short term securities that are held to maturity 
the one security that is classified as available for sale has an interest rate that is reset monthly 
therefore  the market value of the security does not experience significant fluctuations 
imputed interest on the long term notes payable was calculated using an estimated interest rate for a similar instrument  since no objective market exists for this particular obligation 
we have a line of credit facility with a commercial bank with interest payable monthly at basis points above the bank s prime rate or libor 
because of our current cash position and ability to repay the balance on the line of credit we are not subject to financial risk on this obligation if interest rates in the market change significantly 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations 
exchange rate risk we have a sales office in the united kingdom  and therefore transact a portion of our business in british pounds 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the british pound would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not use any hedges or other derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce exchange rate risk
