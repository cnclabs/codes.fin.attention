item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below under the headings consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and  segment results  liquidity and capital resources and elsewhere in this annual report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
readers should be cautioned that a number of important factors  including those identified above in item special note regarding forward looking statements and risks related to our business and industry may affect actual results and may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected in any forward looking statement 
we develop and manufacture small rockets and space systems for commercial  military and civil government customers 
our primary products are satellites and launch vehicles  including low orbit  geosynchronous and planetary spacecraft for communications  remote sensing  scientific and defense missions  ground and air launched rockets that deliver satellites into orbit  and missile defense systems that are used as interceptor and target vehicles 
we also offer space related technical services to government agencies and develop and build satellite based transportation management systems for public transit agencies and private vehicle fleet operators 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to long term contracts and incentives  inventories  long lived assets  warranty obligations  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our revenue is derived primarily from long term contracts 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned 
revenues on long term fixed price contracts are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment  including management s assumptions regarding our future operations as well as general economic conditions 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
frequently  the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and  as such  revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that estimated cost to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
accordingly  our recorded revenues and gross profits from period to period can fluctuate significantly 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss  excluding general and administrative expense  is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated 
certain contracts include incentive provisions for increased or decreased revenue and profit based on actual performance against established targets 
incentive and award fees are included in estimated contract revenue at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based on historical experience and other objective criteria 
should our performance under such contracts differ from previous assumptions  current period revenues would be adjusted 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
estimated market value is determined based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were less favorable than those previously projected by management  inventory write downs could be required 
we record a liability in connection with certain warranty obligations 
our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and compared with revenues our consolidated revenues were million in  a increase compared to million in this increase was driven primarily by a million revenue growth in our satellites and related space systems segment  offset partially by a million decrease in our launch vehicles segment formerly the launch vehicles and advanced programs segment and a million decrease in the transportation management systems segment 
the increase in satellites and related space systems segment revenues is largely attributable to increased revenues from science  technology and defense satellite contracts 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit was million in as compared to million in gross profit is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to revenues recognized 
such costs include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead 
the gross profit increase in  as compared to  was driven by a million increase in our satellites and related space systems segment and a million improvement in our transportation management systems segment  partially offset by a million decrease in our launch vehicles segment 
the increase in our satellites and related space systems segment was primarily due to profit derived from the significant revenue growth in the science  technology and defense satellite product line  offset by lower profit in the communications satellites product line 
the improvement in our transportation management systems segment was mainly attributable to the absence in of cost increases and other charges recorded in on certain transportation management systems contracts 
the decrease in gross profit in our launch vehicles segment was due to the completion of certain advanced space flight systems contracts in and lower profit in our space launch vehicles product line  offset partially by profit growth from our obv missile defense interceptor program 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of our self funded product research and development activities and exclude direct customer funded development activities 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
these expenses related primarily to the development of improved launch vehicles and satellites 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased largely due to a million reduction in bid and proposal costs and million of non recurring litigation expenses in our transportation management systems segment in selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing  advertising  promotional and other selling expenses  as well as the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions 
settlement expense  net in  we recorded a million gain as a credit to settlement expense in connection with the sale of senior subordinated notes which we had received in from our former affiliate  orbital imaging corporation orbimage 
in  orbital recorded million of settlement charges in connection with the settlement of litigation between orbimage and orbital 
these charges included a million delay penalty related to the orbview satellite and a million litigation settlement payment 
also in  we recorded a million reduction in settlement expense in connection with the settlement of an action we had brought against certain of our insurers seeking reimbursement for defense and settlement costs we had incurred several years ago defending a breach of contract lawsuit 
interest expense interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense decreased in as compared to primarily as a result of a lower interest rate on our debt and a reduction in the amortization of debt costs resulting from our refinancing transactions in the third quarter of other income  net other income  net  was million and million in and  respectively 
other income  net  included interest income of million and million in and  respectively 
gain on reversal of allocated losses of affiliate in  we recorded a million gain in connection with the reversal of our previously recorded liability related to the allocated losses of our former affiliate  orbimage 
this gain was recorded as a result of the cancellation of our ownership interest in connection with orbimage s reorganization in december debt extinguishment expense during  we recorded million in debt extinguishment expenses associated with repurchases of a portion of our senior notes and the replacement of our bank credit agreement as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
in  we recorded million in debt extinguishment expenses associated with our debt refinancing in july as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
the debt extinguishment expenses consisted of million in accelerated amortization of debt discount on our notes issued in august  million in accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and million in prepayment premiums and other expenses 
income taxes the million net tax benefit recorded in was comprised of i the million deferred tax benefit in connection with the reversal of the valuation allowance discussed below and ii a million current provision for alternative minimum taxes and state tax obligations 
in  the benefit recorded for income taxes was solely attributable to the refund of state income taxes paid in in prior years and until the fourth quarter of  we had recorded a valuation allowance to fully reserve our net deferred tax assets based on our assessment that the realization of our net deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not criterion under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december  we determined that based upon a number of factors  including our cumulative taxable income in recent years and our expected profitability in future years  substantially all of our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable through future earnings 
accordingly  as of december  we reversed million of our deferred income tax valuation allowance and recorded i a tax benefit of million in our consolidated income statement  ii a million reduction in goodwill and iii a million increase to additional paid in capital 
the portion of the reversal recorded as a reduction in goodwill relates to valuation allowances established in prior years in connection with business acquisitions 
the portion of the reversal recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital is primarily related to tax benefits associated with stock option exercises in and prior years 
beginning in  we expect to record income tax provisions on current earnings at an effective tax rate of approximately 
however  as of december   the company had approximately million of future tax deductions  including nearly million of net operating loss carryforwards  which will be available to offset future taxable income 
accordingly  on a cash basis  we expect to pay minimal income taxes in the foreseeable future 
net income our consolidated net income was million  or diluted earnings per share  and million  or diluted earnings per share  in and  respectively 
the increase in net income in consisted of a million increase in pretax income  plus the million  or per diluted share  income tax benefit in discussed above 
compared with revenues our consolidated revenues were million and million in and  respectively 
consolidated revenues increased in due to increased revenues in our launch vehicles segment  partially offset by lower revenues in our satellites and related space systems and our transportation management systems segments 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit was million and million in and  respectively 
gross profit increased by million in our launch vehicles segment and by million in our satellites and related space systems segment  partially offset by a million decrease in gross profit in our transportation management systems segment 
the increase in gross profit in our launch vehicles segment was largely attributable to increased revenues and profit in our orbital boost vehicle obv missile defense interceptor program and in our space launch vehicle product line 
the increase in gross profit in our satellites and related space systems segment was largely attributable to increased gross profit from our communications satellites product line 
the decrease in gross profit in our transportation management systems segment was largely attributable to significant increases in the first half of in the estimated costs to complete a number of contracts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased primarily as a result of satellite design enhancements and space launch vehicle development activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
the slight decrease in was largely due to lower expenses in our satellite manufacturing business  offset partially by higher general support costs in connection with our obv missile defense interceptor program and increased bid and proposal activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing  advertising  promotional and other selling expenses  as well as the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions 
settlement expense  net in  orbital recorded million of settlement charges in connection with the settlement of litigation between orbimage and orbital 
these charges included a million delay penalty related to the orbview satellite and a million litigation settlement payment

discontinued operations in  we reported  of net income pertaining to operations discontinued in previous years 
cumulative effect of change in accounting in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a million impairment loss in in our transportation management systems segment to write off the remaining net book value of goodwill in this segment 
the impairment loss was determined based on a comparison of the fair value of our transportation management systems reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the fair value of our transportation management systems reporting unit  and the resulting implied fair value of goodwill  were estimated after consideration of letters of interest in respect of purchase offers received by us in early during our attempts to sell the transportation management systems business 
the impairment loss was recorded as a january  cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
net income our net income for was million  or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per share  for the increase in net income from to was primarily related to increased operating income and the absence in of the million goodwill impairment charge for discussed above 
segment results our products and services are grouped into three reportable segments i launch vehicles formerly launch vehicles and advanced programs  ii satellites and related space systems  and iii transportation management systems 
all of our other activities  as well as consolidating eliminations and adjustments  are reported in corporate and other 
the following table summarizes revenues and income from operations for our reportable business segments and corporate and other in thousands years ended december  revenues launch vehicles satellites and related space systems transportation management systems corporate and other total income loss from operations launch vehicles satellites and related space systems transportation management systems corporate and other settlement expense total compared with launch vehicles launch vehicles segment revenues decreased primarily due to a million decrease in revenues from certain advanced space flight systems contracts that were completed in and a million decrease in our space launch vehicle product line  offset partially by a million increase in our obv missile defense interceptor program 
the obv program to develop and manufacture interceptor boost vehicles for the us missile defense agency s ground based midcourse defense system under a contract with the boeing company accounted for million and million in revenues  or and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in our space launch vehicle product line was primarily due to lower pegasus and taurus program revenues 
we completed four pegasus launches during compared to no pegasus launches in  and we completed one taurus launch in may compared to no taurus launches in the reduction in launch vehicle program activity in was partially offset by a million early termination fee recognized in connection with a taurus contract that was cancelled by the customer in december due to a change in the customer s plans prior to our commencing any significant work on the contract 
revenues in our target vehicle product line were relatively unchanged in as compared to operating income decreased due to the completion of certain advanced space flight systems contracts in and lower profit in our space launch vehicles product line  offset partially by increased income from our obv missile defense interceptor program 
operating income from our obv missile defense interceptor program was million in  or of total segment income  compared to million  or of total segment income  in our space launch vehicle product line operating income decreased due to lower program activity  as discussed above  and significant cost growth in on a pegasus contract and a taurus contract  offset partially by the contract termination fee discussed above 
operating income in our target vehicle product line was relatively unchanged in compared to the segment s total operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in satellites and related space systems satellites and related space systems segment revenues increased primarily as a result of revenue growth of million in our science  technology and defense satellite product line and million from technical services  offset partially by an million revenue reduction in our communications satellites product line 
the revenue increase in our science  technology and defense satellite product line was primarily due to million in revenues from defense related contracts awarded in and late  together with revenue growth of million from the dawn interplanetary mission contract with nasa and million from a new nasa scientific satellite contract started late in revenues decreased million to million in our communications satellites product line primarily as a result of the completion of the bsat c and panamsat galaxy xii satellites in and lower program activity in on the telkom satellite contract during  partially offset by revenues from a new contract for two communications satellites awarded in late operating income increased by largely as a result of a million increase in profits derived from the revenue growth in the science  technology and defense satellite product line  partially offset by a million decrease in profits in our communications satellites product line 
the decrease in communications satellites income in was primarily attributable to the completion and launch of the bsat c satellite and the receipt of a million fee associated with the cancellation of a contract in and an operating loss in on the new contract awarded in late these negative factors were partially offset by favorable profit adjustments on certain other communications satellites contracts 
the profit growth in the science  technology and defense satellite product line reflects the revenue growth in this product line in addition to the absence in of million of charges recorded in for increases in the costs to complete the orbview satellite contract 
this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in transportation management systems transportation management systems segment revenues decreased largely due to a reduction in activity on a contract that was substantially completed in the third quarter of this was partially offset by a million favorable revenue adjustment on a previously suspended contract that was renegotiated and resumed in the third quarter of operating results improved from a million loss in to million income in this improvement was primarily attributable to charges in that did not recur in and a million favorable operating income adjustment in from the resumed contract mentioned above 
the charges included million of inventory related charges  million of non recurring litigation expenses and million of unfavorable adjustments as a result of cost increases on a number of contracts 
corporate and other corporate and other revenues are comprised solely of the elimination of intercompany revenues 
corporate and other operating income in is comprised solely of the first quarter gain on the sale of notes received from orbimage discussed above 
in  corporate and other operating results included million of settlement expense discussed in consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and compared with launch vehicles revenues increased in as compared to in large part as a result of increased revenues in our obv missile defense interceptor program 
the obv program accounted for million in revenues  or of total segment revenues in  as compared to million  or  in our space launch vehicle product line also contributed to the year over year increase in revenues  largely due to increased pegasus launch vehicle activity and work on a contract begun in to build three minotaur space launch vehicles for the us department of defense 
we completed four successful pegasus launches during compared to one pegasus launch in higher revenues from our advanced programs in likewise contributed to increased segment revenues 
these revenue increases were offset partially by decreased revenues in our target vehicle product line  which had fewer launches in than in operating income increased approximately in as compared to primarily due to the increased profits from the obv missile defense interceptor program  our advanced programs and our space launch vehicle product line 
operating income from the obv missile defense interceptor program accounted for approximately half of the total operating profit in this segment in the increase in our advanced programs was largely attributable to a favorable contract close out 
the increase in operating income in our space launch vehicle product line for versus was largely attributable to increased operating income from pegasus launch vehicle programs  partially offset by a decrease in operating income from a taurus program 
the taurus program experienced significant cost increases and a schedule delay in the fourth quarter of the operating margin in this segment as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in satellites and related space systems revenues from satellites and related space systems decreased approximately in compared to primarily due to a decline in revenues from our communications satellites product line and our technical services business  offset partially by increased revenues from our science  technology and defense satellite product line 
our communications satellites product line revenues were million in as compared to million in this decrease in the product line s revenues was primarily attributable to lower revenues on our panamsat contract  which was approximately complete as of year end  and the absence in of revenues from the n starc satellite that was completed in mid this decline was offset partially by increased revenue on our telkom satellite contract order received in the second half of the increase in our science  technology and defense satellite product line revenues was largely attributable to work on two new scientific satellite contracts begun during operating income increased from million to million  or  in as compared to largely as a result of improved operating results in the communications satellites product line which were attributable primarily to increased profits from our bsat c and telkom satellite contracts and the absence in of a loss from the n starc satellite that was launched in mid also contributing to the increase in operating income in this segment was higher operating income in our science  technology and defense satellite product line  primarily attributable to income from two new scientific satellite contracts begun during in addition  operating income for included three transactions that largely offset each other 
first  we recorded charges totaling million for increases in the costs to complete the orbview satellite contract 
second  during we received a million fee associated with the cancellation of a communications satellites contract 
the contract was executed in early and the customer cancelled the contract in march as a result of changes to the customer s strategy and plans prior to the commencement of any work on this satellite 
third  we recorded million proceeds received in connection with a litigation settlement as a reduction in operating expense 
the litigation settlement resulted in an approximately million improvement in operating income in  after considering the impact of the settlement on contract profits on a percentage of completion basis 
the operating margin in this segment as a percentage of revenues improved to in as compared to for transportation management systems revenues in our transportation management systems segment decreased approximately in as compared to primarily due to a reduction in activity on several contracts that were nearing completion at the end of  offset partially by increased revenue on one current contract 
our transportation management systems segment reported a million loss in compared to operating income of million in the operating loss in included million of inventory related charges  million of non recurring litigation expenses and million of unfavorable adjustments as a result of cost increases on a number of contracts 
corporate and other corporate and other revenues are comprised solely of the elimination of intercompany revenues 
corporate and other expenses include corporate general and administrative activities that are not attributable to or allocated to the operating segments  as well as consolidating adjustments for intercompany contracts 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operating activities cash flow from operating activities in was million as compared to million in and negative million in the net cash flow provided by operating activities in was primarily attributable to cash generated from continuing operations 
the increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to  and consistent with  the year over year growth in operating results excluding the impact of significant nonrecurring non cash transactions 
the net cash flow provided by operating activities in was primarily attributable to cash generated from operations together with a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset partially by a million increase in receivables and an million reduction in deferred revenues 
in addition  cash flow from continuing operations in included a million add back to  and a million subtraction from  net income from continuing operations associated with debt extinguishment expenses and the reversal of allocated losses of affiliate  respectively 
in  we reported a million net use of cash for continuing operations that was primarily attributable to cash used to fund our operations together with a reduction in accounts payable 
the reduction in accounts payable was largely attributable to the payment of a million vendor financing obligation 
cash flow from investing activities in  we spent million for capital expenditures and we reduced restricted cash by million 
restricted cash was primarily associated with letters of credit issued by financial institutions on our behalf 
these transactions resulted in a net million use of cash for investing activities 
in  we spent million for capital expenditures and we increased restricted cash by million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a million cash receipt from an escrow account related to the sale of a previously divested business  resulting in a net million use of cash for investing activities 
in  we reported a net million use of cash for investing activities  comprised of million for capital expenditures  partially offset by million received from an escrow account related to the sale of a previously divested business 
cash flow from financing activities in  we received million from issuances of common stock primarily in connection with stock option and warrant exercises 
during  we received million from the exercise of million common stock warrants  with an exercise price of per share  that had originally been issued in a total of million warrants expired unexercised on august  during  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock for million 
we also repurchased and cancelled million of our senior notes at a cost of million  and we expended million to obtain a new credit facility discussed below 
in december  we replaced our previous million revolving line of credit with a new five year million revolving credit facility the revolver with bank of america serving as the lead arranger in the syndicated line of credit 
we have the option to increase the amount of the revolver by up to million to the extent that any one or more lenders commits to be a lender for such amount 
loans under the revolver bear interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to  or at a prime rate plus a margin ranging from zero to  with the applicable margin in each case varying according to our ratio of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the revolver is collateralized by our intellectual property and accounts receivable 
up to million of the revolver may be reserved for letters of credit 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the revolver  although million of letters of credit were issued under the revolver 
accordingly  as of december   million of the revolver was available for borrowing 
in  we used million to pay long term debt obligations and we received million net proceeds from issuances of long term debt  primarily associated with the july financing transactions described below 
in addition  we received million net proceeds from issuances of common stock in connection with stock purchases from employees under our employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
in july  we closed two financing transactions 
in the first transaction  we issued million of senior notes due with interest payable semi annually each january and july  starting in during the third quarter of  we used the net proceeds from this offering  together with available cash on hand  to repurchase or redeem all of our million second priority secured notes due in the second transaction  we replaced our previous million revolving line of credit with a million revolving line of credit that was subsequently replaced in december  as described above 
in  we received million in net proceeds from issuances of long term debt and warrants and million from issuances of common stock  and we expended million in principal payments on long term debt 
the net proceeds from issuances of long term debt and warrants included million in net proceeds from our sale of notes and warrants in august and million in net proceeds from a term loan 
principal payments on long term debt consisted primarily of the prepayment of a million term loan and our million subordinated convertible notes  which were due in  and million of principal payments on capital leases and other debt 
the cash received from the issuances of shares of common stock was attributable to issuances under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the existing senior notes and the revolver contain covenants limiting our ability to  among other things  incur more debt  pay cash dividends  make investments  redeem or repurchase orbital stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with others and dispose of assets or create liens on assets 
in addition  the revolver contains financial covenants with respect to leverage  secured leverage  fixed charge coverage  consolidated net worth and the ratio of accounts receivable to senior secured indebtedness 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all of these covenants 
during  we entered into an eight year interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional amount of million  whereby we receive fixed rate interest of in exchange for variable interest payments 
the interest rate is reset quarterly and is equal to the month libor rate plus 
the total variable interest rate was at december  this arrangement has been designated an effective fair value hedge of million of our senior notes due as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was million  which was recorded as a non current asset with an equal increase in long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet 
the following table sets forth our long term obligations  excluding capital lease obligations in thousands december  senior notes  interest due semi annually  principal due in july interest rate swap fair value hedge adjustment on million of senior notes less current portion long term portion the fair value of our senior notes at december  and was estimated at million and million  respectively  based on market trading activity 
available cash and future funding at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
management believes that available cash  cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the revolver will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
our ability to borrow additional funds is limited by the terms of our outstanding debt 
additionally  significant unforeseen events such as termination of major orders or late delivery or failure of launch vehicle or satellite products could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
aggregate contractual obligations the following summarizes orbital s contractual obligations at december   both on and off balance sheet  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions payments due by period less than to to more than total year years years years long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total our obligations under operating leases consist of minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for office space and equipment 
purchase obligations consist of open purchase orders that we issued to acquire materials  parts or services in future periods 
occasionally  certain contracts require us to post letters of credit supporting our performance and refund obligations under the contracts 
we had million of letters of credit outstanding at december   of which million was collateralized by our restricted cash and million was issued under the revolver 
off balance sheet arrangements we believe that we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by applicable securities regulations  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources
