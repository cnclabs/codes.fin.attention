financial and operating performance during the years ended december   and  the company recorded net income of million  million and million  and 
per diluted share  respectively 
compared to  the company s total revenues and other income increased by million  or percent  including a million increase in oil and gas revenues 
the increase in oil and gas revenues was due to increases in production volumes and increases of percent  percent and percent in average oil  ngl and gas prices  respectively  including the effects of commodity price hedges 
compared to  the company s total costs and expenses increased by million  or percent  during the year ended december  the increase in total costs and expenses was primarily reflective of a million increase in depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a expense  primarily driven by increases in depletion associated with increased production volumes from higher cost basis deepwater gulf of mexico and south africa properties  a million increase in oil and gas production costs  which primarily resulted from increases in production volumes  the strengthening of both the argentine peso and canadian dollar and commodity prices that impacted variable lease operating expenses and production taxes  a million increase in exploration and abandonments expense primarily due to increased exploration extension drilling in the gulf of mexico  argentina  canada and gabon and a million impairment charge on the company s gabonese properties

evergreen merger on september   pioneer completed its merger with evergreen 
pioneer acquired the common stock of evergreen for a total purchase price of approximately billion  which was comprised of cash and pioneer common stock 
at the merger date  evergreen s proved reserves were approximately mmboe 
evergreen was a publicly traded independent oil and gas company primarily engaged in the production  development  exploration and acquisition of north american unconventional gas 
evergreen was based in denver  colorado and was one of the leading developers of cbm reserves in the united states 
evergreen s operations were principally focused on developing and expanding its cbm gas field located in the raton basin in southern colorado 
evergreen also had operations in the piceance basin in western colorado  the uinta basin in eastern utah and the western canada sedimentary basin 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for more information regarding the evergreen merger 
outlook and activities volumetric production payments 
during january  the company sold two percent of its total proved reserves  or million boe of proved reserves  by means of two volumetric production payments vpps for total proceeds of million and the assumption of the company s obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements 
proceeds from the vpps were initially used to pay down indebtedness 
the vpps represent limited term overriding royalty interests in oil and gas reserves which i entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes over a period of time from specific lease interests  ii are free and clear of all associated future production costs and capital expenditures  iii are nonrecourse to the company ie  the purchaser s only recourse is to the assets acquired  iv transfers title to the purchaser and v allows the company to retain the assets after the vpp s volumetric obligations have been satisfied 
the first vpp sells bcf of hugoton field gas volumes over an expected five year term beginning in february for million of proceeds 
the second vpp sells mmboe of spraberry field oil volumes over an expected seven year term beginning in january for million of proceeds 
a vpp is considered a sale of proved reserves and the related future production of those proved reserves 
as a result the company will i remove the proved reserves associated with the vpps  ii recognize the vpp proceeds as deferred revenue which will be amortized on a unit of production basis to future oil and gas revenues over the terms of the vpps  iii retain responsibility for percent of the production costs and capital costs related to vpp interests and iv no longer recognize production associated with the vpp volumes  resulting in higher future revenue per boe  production costs per boe and dd a per boe ratios 
the company will amortize to oil and gas revenues million of net deferred gas revenue during associated with the hugoton field vpp 
during  the company will amortize million of net deferred gas revenue associated with the hugoton field vpp and million of net deferred oil revenue associated with the spraberry field vpp 
commodity prices 
world oil prices increased during the year ended december  in response to political unrest and supply disruptions in iraq and venezuela as well as other supply and demand factors 
north american gas prices also increased during in response to continued strong supply and demand fundamentals 
the company s outlook for commodity prices continues to be cautiously optimistic 
significant factors that will impact commodity prices include developments in iraq and other middle east countries  the extent to which members of the opec and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas and variations in key north american gas supply and demand indicators 
pioneer will continue to strategically hedge oil and gas price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on its oil  ngl and gas revenues 
see note k of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s commodity hedge positions at december  also see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for disclosures about the company s commodity related derivative financial instruments 
capital expenditures 
during  the company s budget for oil and gas capital activities is expected to range from million to million  of which approximately percent has been budgeted for lower risk development and extension drilling and facility costs and percent for exploration expenditures 
the company s capital budget is allocated approximately percent to the united states  percent to argentina and five percent to each of africa and canada 
pioneer expects to drill approximately exploration and development wells during during and  the company expects to expend approximately million and million  respectively  of capital for development drilling and facility costs related to its proved undeveloped reserves 
production growth 
the company expects that its annual worldwide production will range from mmboe to mmboe  or approximately mboe to mboe per day 
the forecasted range includes a full year of production from the assets acquired in the evergreen merger and has been reduced by the vpp volumes sold during january the company expects  based on quoted futures prices  to generate cash flow significantly in excess of its capital program which will further enhance the company s financial flexibility to fund the development of future exploration successes  core area acquisitions and additional development drilling 
with several discoveries in various stages of commercialization  a pipeline of exploration opportunities  the potential for continued core area acquisitions  continuing strong commodity prices and significant excess cash flow  pioneer has targeted five year average compounded annual production growth of eight percent to nine percent or ten percent per share  giving consideration to contemplated share repurchases 
costs and expenses 
the company expects that its costs and expenses that are highly correlated with production volumes  such as production costs and depletion expense  will increase in absolute amounts during and that production costs  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and other costs and expenses will increase on a per boe basis as a result of the sale of proved reserves through the vpps 
additionally  the company expects that depletion expense will increase on a per boe basis during as compared to due to increased production from the devils tower oil field in the deepwater gulf of mexico and the assets acquired in the evergreen merger 
the per boe cost basis of these fields is higher than that of pioneer s average producing property in ad valorem taxes are highly correlated with prior year commodity prices 
as a consequence of increases in oil  ngl and gas prices during  ad valorem taxes are expected to be higher in  as compared to the company also anticipates an increase in general and administrative expenses during due to additional staffing associated with the evergreen merger and anticipated company growth  as well as the amortization of deferred compensation associated with unvested restricted stock and stock options 
capital allocation 
during  the company improved its financial position and achieved investment grade standards 
the company is now targeting mid investment grade ratings 
towards that end  the company established a targeted range for debt to book capitalization of less than percent by the end of  as further discussed later 
during  the company paid dividends of 
per common share in two semiannual installments of 
per common share  and the company currently expects to  as a minimum  maintain this level of dividends in during through  the company anticipates  based upon year end futures prices  that it will have significant excess cash flow after funding its typical annual capital budgets  planned dividends and achieving its leverage targets 
the company considers it a high priority to utilize a portion of the excess cash flow to fund the development of new exploration successes and to selectively acquire additional assets in its core areas 
the company will also use a portion of the excess cash flow for share repurchases  pursuant to the recently approved million stock repurchase program 
first quarter based on current estimates  the company expects that first quarter production will average  to  boe per day 
this range is lower than the fourth quarter average reflecting the vpp volumes sold  more days of downtime and a gradual ramp up of production for the canyon express system which has been undergoing repairs  the timing of oil cargo shipments in tunisia and south africa which were high during the fourth quarter  and the typical seasonal decline in gas demand during argentina s summer season 
first quarter production costs including production and ad valorem taxes are expected to average to per boe based on current nymex strip prices for oil and gas 
the increase over the prior quarter is a result of the retention of operating costs related to the vpp volumes sold  an increase in production and ad valorem taxes and additional workovers planned during the canadian winter access season 
production costs are expected to decline in the second quarter of as lower cost volumes resume from the deepwater gulf of mexico and workovers return to more normal levels 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense is expected to average to per boe 
total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be million to million 
several higher risk exploration wells and significant seismic investments are planned during the first quarter  serving to front end load the company s exploration program 
specifically  first quarter exploration activity is expected to include an appraisal well to the thunder hawk discovery and an exploration well on a falcon corridor satellite prospect in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
in alaska  as many as three wells are expected to test new exploration targets and pioneer plans to shoot seismic over newly acquired acreage 
one well is planned in west africa and lower risk exploration and geologic and geophysical work will also continue in argentina  canada and tunisia 
general and administrative expense is expected to be million to million 
interest expense is expected to be million to million  and accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be approximately million to million 
the company s effective income tax rate is expected to range from percent to percent based on current capital spending plans  including cash income taxes of million to million that are principally related to argentine and tunisian income taxes and nominal alternative minimum tax in the us other than in argentina and tunisia  the company continues to benefit from the carryforward of net operating losses and other positive tax attributes 
debt reduction target 
although the evergreen merger has resulted in an increase in the company s ratio of debt to book capitalization  the company has targeted a ratio of debt to book capitalization of less than percent by the end of to achieve this target  the company plans to apply a portion of the proceeds from the vpps and the divestiture of certain canadian assets for expected proceeds of over million to reduce debt 
in addition  the company expects cash flows to be significantly in excess of the capital program based on current commodity prices which can be used to further reduce debt 
field fuel reporting during the fourth quarter of  the company completed a voluntary internal review of the various accounting treatments related to field fuel costs used by major oil companies and other independents in order to determine common industry practice 
the review  in part  was undertaken in response to the large volume of field fuel usage related to the assets acquired from evergreen 
field fuel is gas consumed to operate field equipment primarily compressors prior to the gas being delivered to a sales point 
pioneer has historically recorded the value of field fuel as an operating expense with an equal amount recorded as oil and gas revenues  with no net income effect 
pioneer also reflected the volumes associated with field fuel in gas production 
this practice has been routinely discussed by the company  especially in relation to the rising value of the fuel used in the field and its contribution to rising field operating expenses 
although the company believes that its past treatment of field fuel was acceptable  the company changed its reporting of field fuel  no longer recording it as revenue or expense and not including it as production 
pioneer believes this presentation is more common in the industry and will provide a better basis for comparing pioneer to other oil and gas companies 
within this report  the company has adjusted its prior period revenues  production costs and sales volumes to reflect the new method of reporting field fuel 
the change in reporting field fuel did not change reported net income of the periods presented since revenues and production costs were changed in equal amounts 
critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this report in accordance with gaap 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a comprehensive discussion of the company s significant accounting policies 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
following is a discussion of the company s most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the company s application of gaap 
accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires the company s management to choose between gaap alternatives and to make judgments about estimates of future uncertainties 
successful efforts method of accounting 
the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method 
in general  the company believes that  during periods of active exploration  net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method 
the critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows under the successful efforts method  exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur  whereas  under the full cost method of accounting  such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets  pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense 
during the years ended december   and  the company recognized exploration  abandonment  geological and geophysical expense of million  million and million  respectively  under the successful efforts method 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of the company s proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of o the quality and quantity of available data  o the interpretation of that data  o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and o the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the company s proved reserve information included in this report as of december   and was audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the company s major properties and prepared by the company s engineers with respect to all other properties 
estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify  positively or negatively  material revisions to the estimate of proved reserves 
it should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows included in this report as of december  is the current market value of the company s estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company based the estimated present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the company s estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which the company records depletion expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the company s assessment of its oil and gas producing properties and goodwill for impairment 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
the company reviews its long lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon its outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties and if a significant downward revision has occurred to the estimated proved reserves 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated 
impairment of unproved oil and gas properties 
management periodically assesses unproved oil and gas properties for impairment  on a project by project basis 
management s assessment of the results of exploration activities  commodity price outlooks  planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions  if any 
suspended wells 
the company suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the oil and gas discovery 
the ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions 
if the company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or development of these fields  the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and abandonment expense 
the company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory well as an asset in its consolidated balance sheets for more than one year following the completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds oil and gas reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the following conditions are met i the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made 
ii drilling of the additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the near future 
due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of certain alaskan  deepwater gulf of mexico and foreign projects  it may take the company longer than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and economics associated with making a determination on its commercial viability 
in these instances  the projects feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology  but rather the company s ongoing efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information  gaining access to other companies production  transportation or processing facilities and or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells 
these activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly 
consequently  the company s assessment of suspended exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is impaired 
see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s suspended exploratory well costs 
assessments of functional currencies 
management determines the functional currencies of the company s subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues  costs and expenses 
the us dollar is the functional currency of all of the company s international operations except canada 
the assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position 
argentine economic and currency measures 
the accounting for and remeasurement of the company s argentine balance sheets as of december  and reflect management s assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to argentina s current economic situation 
the argentine economic and political situation continues to evolve and the argentine government may enact future regulations or policies that  when finalized and adopted  may materially impact  among other items  i the realized prices the company receives for the commodities it produces and sells  ii the timing of repatriations of excess cash flow to the company s corporate headquarters in the united states  iii the company s asset valuations  and iv peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a description of the assumptions utilized in the preparation of these financial statements 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized prior to their expiration 
pioneer monitors company specific  oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and reassesses the likelihood that the company s net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration 
there can be no assurances that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the company to establish a united states deferred tax asset valuation allowance in a future period 
as of december   the company does not believe there is sufficient positive evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to foreign tax jurisdictions 
goodwill impairment 
the company will review its goodwill for impairment at least annually 
this requires the company to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units that have goodwill 
there is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values  particularly proved reserve estimates as described above 
litigation and environmental contingencies 
the company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation 
actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons 
the costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages 
similarly  environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws  regulations  additional information obtained relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology 
under gaap  a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimated 
see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the company s commitments and contingencies

as previously discussed  the company changed its method of reporting field fuel usage during the fourth quarter of accordingly  the gas revenues  production volumes and related per unit measures of all periods presented have been adjusted in accordance with the new method of reporting field fuel 
hedging activities 
the oil and gas prices that the company reports are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted by the results of the company s cash flow hedging activities 
the company utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to i reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the company produces and sells  ii support the company s annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and iii reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects 
the effective portions of changes in the fair values of the company s commodity price hedges are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders equity until the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
consequently  changes in the effective portions of commodity price hedges add volatility to the company s reported stockholders equity until the hedge derivative matures or is terminated

argentine commodity prices 
during  the argentine government implemented a percent tax on oil exports 
during and  the company exported approximately percent and five percent  respectively  of its argentine oil production 
associated therewith  the company incurred oil export taxes of million and million for and  respectively 
during  the company did not export any of its argentine oil production 
the export tax has also had the effect of decreasing internal argentine oil revenues not only export revenues by the taxes levied 
the us dollar equivalent value for domestic argentine oil sales now paid in pesos has generally moved toward parity with the us dollar denominated export values  net of the export tax 
the adverse impact of this tax has been partially offset by the net cost savings resulting from the devaluation of the peso on peso denominated costs 
in january  at the argentine government s request  oil producers and refiners agreed to cap amounts payable for certain domestic sales at per bbl which remained in effect through april the producers and refiners further agreed that the difference between the actual price and the capped price would be payable once actual prices fall below the cap 
subsequently the terms were modified such that while the per bbl payable cap was in place  the refiners would have no obligation to pay producers for sales values that exceeded per bbl 
initially  the refiners and producers also agreed to discount us dollar denominated oil prices at percent prior to converting to pesos at the current exchange rate for the purpose of invoicing and settling oil sales to argentine refiners 
in may  refiners and producers changed the discount percentage from percent for all price levels to percent if west texas intermediate wti was equal to or less than per bbl and percent if wti exceeded per bbl 
all the oil prices are adjusted for normal quality differentials prior to applying the discount 
in  it appeared probable that the price of world oil would remain above the cap for the foreseeable future 
given the uncertainty surrounding the timing of when argentine producers could expect to collect balances outstanding from refiners  the company ceased recognizing revenue and began recording any excess between the actual sales price pursuant to its oil sales contracts with argentine refiners that were subject to the price stabilization agreement and the price cap as deferred revenue in the balance sheet 
at december   the company had million of deferred revenue reflected in its balance sheet associated with the sales in excess of the price cap 
the decision by argentine oil producers and refiners to not renew the price stability agreement beyond april  does not terminate the obligation of refiners to reimburse producers for balances that accumulated from january through april  if and when the price of wti falls below in may  the argentine government increased the export tax from percent to percent 
this tax is applied on the sales value after the tax  thus  the net effect of the percent and percent rates is percent and percent  respectively 
in august  the argentine government further increased the export tax rates for oil exports 
the export tax now escalates from the current percent percent effective rate to a maximum rate of percent percent effective rate of the realized value for exported barrels as wti prices per barrel increase from less than to and above 
the export tax is not deducted in the calculation of royalty payments and expires in february given the number of governmental changes during affecting the realized price the company receives for its oil sales  no specific predictions can be made about the future of oil prices in argentina  however  in the short term  the company expects argentine oil realizations to be less than oil realizations in the united states 
as a result of economic emergency law enacted by the argentine government in january  the company s gas prices  expressed in us dollars  have also fallen in proportion to the devaluation of the argentine peso since the end of due to the pesofication of contracts and freezing of gas prices at the wellhead required by that law 
as a baseline  the company s realized argentine gas price was per mcf as compared to  
and 
in  and  respectively 
the unfavorable gas price has acted to discourage gas development activities and increased gas demand 
without development of gas reserves in argentina  supplies of gas in the country have declined  while demand for gas has been increasing due to the resurgence of the argentine economy and the higher cost of alternative fuels 
recently  gas exports to chile were curtailed at the direction of the argentine government and argentina entered into an agreement to import gas from bolivia at prices starting at approximately per mcf at the border  including transportation costs 
in may  pursuant to a decree  the argentine government approved measures to permit producers to renegotiate gas sales contracts  excluding those that could affect small residential customers  in accordance with scheduled price increases specified in the decree 
the wellhead prices in the decree rise from a current range of 
to 
per mcf to a range of 
to per mcf after july   depending on the region where the gas is produced 
no further gas price increases beyond july have been allowed for in the current decree 
other than an expectation that gas prices will be permitted to increase gradually over time  as has already been demonstrated by the governing authorities  no specific predictions can be made about the future of gas prices in argentina  however  the company expects argentine gas realizations to be less than gas realizations in the united states 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion of commodity prices in argentina 
interest and other income 
the company recorded interest and other income totaling million  million and during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s interest and other income was comprised of revenue that was not directly attributable to oil and gas producing activities or oil and gas property divestitures 
see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding interest and other income 
gain on disposition of assets 
during the years ended december   and  the company completed asset divestitures for net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively 
associated therewith  the company recorded gains on disposition of assets of thousand  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during the years ended december   and were used  together with net cash flows provided by operating activities  to fund additions to oil and gas properties and to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
see note o of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding asset divestitures 
oil and gas production costs 
the company recorded production costs of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in general  lease operating expenses and workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the company has management control  while production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes

see notes f and k of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplemental data and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information about the company s debt instruments and interest rate hedging activities 
the company s future debt level is dependent primarily on net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from financing activities and proceeds generated from asset dispositions 
the company believes it has substantial borrowing capacity  which has been further enhanced during by the use of the vpp net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness  to meet any unanticipated cash requirements  and during low commodity price periods  the company has the flexibility to increase borrowings and or modify its capital spending to meet its contractual obligations and maintain its debt ratings 
during  million of the company s senior notes due the notes will mature and the day credit agreement will have its first anniversary 
the company intends to initially utilize unused borrowing capacity under its day credit agreement to repay the notes and to transfer outstanding borrowings  if any  under the day credit agreement to the company s revolving credit agreement on its first anniversary 
the company also intends to refinance  under its revolving credit agreement  the cash component of a redemption price associated with any redemption of the convertible notes prior to december  should redemptions occur 
accordingly  the company s consolidated balance sheet does not reflect any current portion of long term debt as of december  as the company pursues its strategy  it may utilize various financing sources  including fixed and floating rate debt  convertible securities  preferred stock or common stock 
the company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties  stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related assets 
additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the company s board of directors 
liquidity

outstanding borrowings under the lines of credit totaled million as of december  including million of undrawn and outstanding letters of credit under the lines of credit  the company had million of unused borrowing capacity as of december  book capitalization and current ratio 
the company s book capitalization at december  was billion  consisting of debt of billion and stockholders equity of billion 
consequently  the company s debt to book capitalization decreased to percent at december  from percent at december  as more fully discussed in outlook and activities above  the company has targeted a range for debt to book capitalization of less than percent by the end of the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 
at december  as compared to 
at december  the improvement in the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was primarily due to increases in oil and gas receivables due to higher commodity prices 
debt ratings 
the company receives debt credit ratings from standard poor s ratings group  inc s p and moody s investor services  inc 
moody s and are subject to regular reviews 
the company s debt is currently rated bbb with a negative outlook by s p and baa with a negative outlook by moody s  both of which are investment grade ratings 
s p and moody s consider many factors in determining the company s ratings including production growth opportunities  liquidity  debt levels and asset and reserve mix 
there are no ratings triggers in any of the company s contractual obligations that would accelerate the related scheduled maturities should the company s ratings fall below certain levels 
if the company were to be downgraded by either s p or moody s  it could negatively impact the interest rate and fees on existing indebtedness and the company s ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate and fees associated with additional financing 
new accounting pronouncement on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles bulletin opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r will require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  and permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods o a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date of sfas r that remain unvested on the adoption date 
o a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
the company has elected to adopt the provisions of sfas r on july  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and related interpretations 
as such  the company generally does not recognize compensation expenses associated with employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method could have a significant impact on the company s future result of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures in note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
the adoption of sfas r will have no effect on the company s outstanding restricted stock awards 
the company estimates that the adoption of sfas r  based on the outstanding unvested stock options at december   will result in future compensation charges to general and administrative expenses of approximately million during the period from july  through december   and approximately million during the company has an employee stock purchase plan the espp that allows eligible employees to annually purchase the company s common stock at a discount 
the provisions of sfas r will cause the espp to be a compensatory plan 
however  the change in accounting for the espp is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  future results of operations or liquidity 
historically  the espp compensatory amounts have been nominal 
see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information regarding the espp 
sfas r also requires the tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may serve to reduce the company s future cash provided by operating activities and increase future cash provided by financing activities  to the extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company did not recognize any such tax benefits during item a

international investments represent  and are expected to continue to represent  a significant portion of the company s total assets 
pioneer currently has international operations in africa  argentina and canada  which represent nine  seven and five percent of the company s revenues  respectively 
pioneer continues to identify and evaluate other international opportunities 
as a result of such foreign operations  pioneer s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  weak economic conditions or changes in political climates in these foreign countries 
the company s international operations may be adversely affected by political and economic instability  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and other factors 
for example o local political and economic developments could restrict or increase the cost of pioneer s foreign operations  o exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result in financial losses  o royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims could increase costs of pioneer s foreign operations  o expropriation of the company s property could result in loss of revenue  property and equipment  o civil uprising  riots  terrorist attacks and wars could make it impractical to continue operations  resulting in financial losses  o import and export regulations and other foreign laws or policies could result in loss of revenues  o repatriation levels for export revenues could restrict the availability of cash to fund operations outside a particular foreign country and o laws and policies of the us affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment could restrict pioneer s ability to fund foreign operations or may make foreign operations more costly 
pioneer does not currently maintain political risk insurance 
pioneer evaluates on a country by country basis whether obtaining political risk coverage is necessary and may add such insurance in the future if the company believes it is prudent 
africa 
pioneer s operations in africa are in south africa  tunisia  gabon and equatorial guinea 
the company views the operating environment in these african nations as stable and the economic stability as good 
while the values of the various african nations currencies do fluctuate in relation to the us dollar  the company believes that any currency risk associated with pioneer s african operations would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations given that such operations are closely tied to oil prices which are denominated in us dollars 
argentina 
during the decade of the s  argentina s government pursued free market policies  including the privatization of state owned companies  deregulation of the oil and gas industry  tax reforms to equalize tax rates for domestic and foreign investors  liberalization of import and export laws and the lifting of exchange controls 
the cornerstone of these reforms was the convertibility law that established an exchange rate of one argentine peso to one us dollar 
these policies were successful as evidenced by the elimination of inflation and substantial economic growth during the early to mid s 
however  throughout the decade  the argentine government failed to balance its fiscal budget  incurring repeated significant fiscal deficits that by the end of resulted in the accumulation of billion of debt 
during  argentina found itself in a critical economic situation with the combination of high levels of external indebtedness  a financial and banking system in crisis  a country risk rating that had reached levels beyond the historical norm  a high level of unemployment and an economic contraction that had lasted four years 
late in  the country was unable to obtain additional funding from the international monetary fund 
economic instability increased  resulting in substantial withdrawals of cash from the argentine banking system over a short period of time 
the government was forced to implement monetary restrictions and placed limitations on the transfer of funds out of the country without the authorization of the central bank of the republic of argentina 
president de la rua and his entire administration were forced to resign in the face of public dissatisfaction 
after his resignation in december  there was  for a few weeks  a revolving door of presidents that were appointed to office by argentina s congress  but quickly resigned in reaction to public outcry 
eduardo duhalde was appointed president of argentina in january to hold office until the presidential election 
in january  the government defaulted on a significant portion of argentina s billion of debt and the national congress passed emergency law  which  among other things  overturned the long standing  but unsustainable  convertibility plan 
the government adopted a floating rate of exchange in february two specific provisions of the emergency law directly impact the company 
first  a tax on the value of hydrocarbon exports was established effective march  the second provision was the requirement that domestic commercial transactions  or contracts  for sales in argentina that were previously denominated in us dollars be converted to pesos us  pesofication at an exchange rate to be negotiated between sellers and buyers 
furthermore  the government placed a price freeze on gas prices at the wellhead 
with the price of gas pesofied and frozen  the us dollar equivalent price of gas in argentina fell in direct proportion to the level of devaluation 
the abandonment of the convertibility plan and the decision to allow the peso to float in international exchange markets resulted in significant devaluation of the peso 
by september   the peso to us dollar exchange rate had increased from to however  since the end of the third quarter of  argentina s economy has shown signs of stabilization 
at december   the peso to us dollar exchange rate was in argentina  unlike pioneer s other operating areas  there have been significant factors that have kept the commodity prices  in general  below those of the world markets and may continue to do so 
the following is a discussion of the matters affecting argentine commodity prices o oil prices in january  the argentine government devalued the peso and enacted an emergency law that  in part  required certain contracts that were previously payable in us dollars to be payable in pesos 
subsequently  in february  the argentine government announced a percent tax on oil exports  effective march  the tax is limited by law to a term of no more than five years 
the export tax is not deducted in the calculation of royalty payments 
domestic argentine oil sales  while valued in us dollars  are now being paid in pesos 
export oil sales continue to be valued and paid in us dollars 
in january  at the argentine government s request  oil producers and refiners agreed to cap amounts payable for certain domestic sales at per bbl which remained in effect through april the producers and refiners further agreed that the difference between the actual price and the capped price would be payable once actual prices fall below the cap 
subsequently the terms were modified such that while the per bbl payable cap was in place  the refiners would have no obligation to pay producers for sales values that exceeded per bbl 
initially  the refiners and producers also agreed to discount us dollar denominated oil prices at percent prior to converting to pesos at the current exchange rate for the purpose of invoicing and settling oil sales to argentine refiners 
in may  refiners and producers changed the discount percentage from percent for all price levels to percent if wti was equal to or less than per bbl and percent if wti exceeded per bbl 
all the oil prices are adjusted for normal quality differentials prior to applying the discount 
in may  the argentine government increased the export tax from percent to percent 
this tax is applied on the sales value after the tax  thus  the net effect of the percent and percent rates is percent and percent  respectively 
in august  the argentine government further increased the export tax rates for oil exports 
the export tax now escalates from the current percent percent effective rate to a maximum rate of percent percent effective rate of the realized value for exported barrels as wti prices per barrel increase from less than to and above 
during and  the company exported approximately percent and five percent  respectively  of its argentine oil production 
associated therewith  the company incurred oil export taxes of million and million for and  respectively 
during  the company did not export any of its argentine oil production 
as noted above  the export tax has also had the effect of decreasing internal argentine oil revenues not only export revenues by the taxes levied 
the us dollar equivalent value for domestic argentine oil sales has generally moved toward parity with the us dollar denominated export values  net of the export tax 
the adverse impact of this tax has been partially offset by the net cost savings resulting from the devaluation of the peso on peso denominated costs such as labor 
given the number of governmental changes during affecting the realized price the company receives for its oil sales  no specific predictions can be made about the future of oil prices in argentina  however  in the short term  the company expects argentine oil realizations to be less than oil realizations in the united states 
o gas prices the company sells its gas to argentine customers pursuant to a peso denominated contracts  b long term dollar denominated contracts and c spot market sales 
as a result of economic emergency law enacted by the argentine government in january  the company s gas prices  expressed in us dollars  have fallen in proportion to the devaluation of the argentine peso since the end of due to the pesofication of contracts and the freezing of gas prices at the wellhead required by that law 
as a baseline  the company s realized gas price was per mcf as compared to  
and 
in  and  respectively 
the unfavorable gas price has acted to discourage gas development activities and increased gas demand 
without development of gas reserves in argentina  supplies of gas in the country have declined  while demand for gas has been increasing due to the resurgence of the argentine economy and the higher cost of alternative fuels 
recently  gas exports to chile were curtailed at the direction of the argentine government and argentina entered into an agreement to import gas from bolivia at prices starting at approximately per mcf at the border  including transportation costs 
in may  pursuant to a decree  the argentine government approved measures to permit producers to renegotiate gas sales contracts  excluding those that could affect small residential customers  in accordance with scheduled price increases specified in the decree 
the wellhead prices in the decree rise from a current range of 
to 
per mcf to a range of 
to per mcf after july  depending on the region where the gas is produced 
no further gas price increases beyond july have been allowed for in the current decree 
other than an expectation that gas prices will be permitted to increase gradually over time  as has already been demonstrated by the governing authorities  no specific predictions can be made about the future of gas prices in argentina  however  the company expects argentine gas realizations to be less than gas realizations in the united states 
canada 
the company views the operating environment in canada as stable and the economic stability as good 
a portion of the company s canadian revenues and substantially all of its costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
while the value of the canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to the us dollar  the company believes that any currency risk associated with its canadian operations would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
as of december   the company s primary risk exposures associated with financial instruments to which it is a party include oil and gas price volatility  volatility in the exchange rates of the canadian dollar and argentine peso vis a vis the us dollar and interest rate volatility 
the company s primary risk exposures associated with financial instruments have not changed significantly since december
