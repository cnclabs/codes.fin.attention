item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we deliver simple  secure and manageable enterprise mobility services  maximizing the productivity of workers as they move between office  home and remote locations 
our policy management services close the gaps in protecting computers  network assets  user identities and data whenever users connect over the internet 
our connectivity services utilize the ipass global virtual network  a unified network of hundreds of dial up  wireless  and broadband providers in over countries 
overview of in  we increased revenues and end users over  although not at the rate we had anticipated as growth from our traditional dial up business slowed substantially to rates below those we had historically experienced 
we continued to expand both our dial up and broadband global footprints in  which enabled our users to remotely access their corporate networks from more locations  with increased redundancy than in any previous year 
another goal in was to improve upon our existing service offerings as well as add new products and services in order to drive revenue growth and to expand our existing customer base 
we accelerated our timetable for the development and improvement of new and existing products and services through increased spending on research and development 
we also added to our product offering through the acquisitions of safew and mobile automation in september and october  respectively 
for additional information on the acquisitions  please see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents going forward  we will continue to focus on delivering innovative services and solutions for our customers  increasing the number of end users of our services for both dial up and broadband access  as well as focus on generating revenues from our endpoint policy management products and services 
in  we expect to see continued growth in our business 
however  our success could be limited by several factors  including the timely release of new products  continued market acceptance of our products and the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors 
for a further discussion of these and other risk factors  see the section below entitled factors affecting operating results 
sources of revenues we derive our revenues primarily from providing enterprise connectivity services through our virtual network 
we sell these services directly  as well as indirectly through our channel partners 
we bill substantially all customers on a time basis for usage based on negotiated rates 
we bill the remaining customers based on a fixed charge per active user per month with additional charges for excess time 
substantially all enterprise customers commit to a one to three year contract term 
most of our contracts with enterprise customers contain minimum usage levels 
our usage based revenues represented and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although we have incurred expenses to expand our broadband coverage and are seeking to generate additional revenues from our broadband wired and wireless coverage  we have generated less than of our usage revenues from broadband coverage in and we cannot determine when  if ever  we will generate any substantial revenues from broadband 
with the acquisition of mobile automation in october of  we also began generating license and maintenance revenue through software licensing agreements 
we bill customers for minimum commitments when actual usage is less than their monthly minimum commitment amount 
we recognize the difference between the minimum commitment and actual usage as fee revenue once the cash for such fee has been collected 
we also provide customers with deployment services and technical support throughout the term of the contract 
we typically charge fees for these services on a one time or annual basis  depending on the service provided and the nature of the relationship 
in addition  we also offer customers additional services for which we generally bill on a monthly basis 
fees for these services  together with revenues generated from license and maintenance fees  represented approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates are important in understanding our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition services and fees the company derives substantially all of its revenues from usage fees 
the company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  service has been provided to the customer  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 

table of contents revenues are recognized during the period the services are rendered to end users based on usage at negotiated rates 
the company typically requires its customers to commit to minimum usage levels 
minimum usage levels can be based on an annual term  monthly term or over the term of the arrangement 
if actual usage in a given period is less than the minimum commitment  the company recognizes the difference between the actual usage and the minimum commitment as revenue when cash is collected because the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the difference that will be collected 
the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the difference to be collected because it has from time to time renegotiated minimum commitments in cases where customers have sought renegotiation of their contract for reasons such as a significant downturn in their business or where the company has determined that it would be in its best interest to do so 
customers are not contractually entitled to use or otherwise receive benefit for unused service in subsequent periods 
the company typically provides its customers with deployment services  technical support and additional optional services 
depending on the service provided and the nature of the arrangement  the company may charge a one time  annual or monthly fee 
revenues relating to one time fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the initial contract  generally one to three years 
revenues relating to annual fees are recognized on a straight line basis 
revenues for monthly services are recognized during the month that these services are provided 
license and maintenance license revenue consists principally of revenue earned under software license agreements 
license revenue is generally recognized when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably probable 
we enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software  upgrades and maintenance and support multiple element arrangements 
when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
vsoe of fair value is established by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by aicpa statement of position sop revenue from subscription license agreements  which include software  rights to future products and maintenance  is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
revenue on shipments to resellers  which is generally subject to certain rights of return and price protection  is recognized when the products are sold by the resellers to the end user customer 
maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing software updates on a when and if available basis and technical support for software products post contract support or pcs 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
payments received in advance of services performed are deferred 
allowances for estimated future returns and discounts are provided for upon recognition of revenue 
the company generally performs credit reviews to evaluate the customers ability to pay 
if the company determines that collectibility is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
we establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in the valuation allowance are included in our consolidated statements of income as a provision for benefit from income taxes 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 

table of contents during the year ended december   we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize all of our available net deferred tax assets in the carryforward period of up to years 
as a result  we determined that it was no longer necessary or appropriate to maintain a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we recorded a million tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  although we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee this will be the case as our ability to use the net operating losses is contingent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period 
at each period end  we reassess our ability to realize our net operating losses 
if we conclude it is more likely than not that we would not realize the benefit of our net operating losses  we may have to re establish the valuation allowance and therefore record a significant charge to our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a detailed assessment of accounts receivable for specific  as well as anticipated  uncollectible accounts receivable 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and historical payment experience 
we have an allowance for doubtful accounts of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimated the allowances required  additional allowances may be required  which would result in an increased general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
results of operations revenue december  change change in thousands  except percentages total revenue the growth in total revenue in over was due to an increase in the usage of our services resulting from an increased number of end users of our services at new and existing customers

table of contents to date  all of our revenues have been denominated in us dollars  although in the future some portion of revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies 
operating expenses network access network access expenses consist of charges for access  principally by the minute  that we pay to our network service providers 
december  change change in thousands  except percentages network access expenses as a percent of revenue the growth in network access expenses in over was due to increased usage of our virtual network 
in we continued to purchase network access from additional service providers at a lower cost and to renegotiate a number of our network service provider contracts  resulting in lower network access costs for dial up 
this was offset in part by an increase in network access expenses for broadband usage  which are typically higher than dial up 
we expect network access expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as usage of our virtual network increases  but to remain relatively constant or increase slightly as a percentage of revenues 
the growth in network access expenses in over was due to increased usage of our virtual network 
the decrease as a percent of revenues from was due to reduced access rates  which resulted from our ability to purchase network access from additional service providers at a lower cost and to renegotiate a number of our network service provider contracts 
network operations network operations expenses consist of compensation and benefits for our network engineering  customer support  network access quality and information technology personnel  outside consultants  transaction center fees  depreciation of our network equipment  and certain allocated overhead costs 
december  change change in thousands  except percentages network operations expenses as a percent of revenue the increase in network operations expenses in over in absolute dollars was due primarily to million in additional compensation and benefits expense due to an increase in personnel   of additional transaction center fees  and  of additional depreciation expense on network operations equipment in support and expansion of our virtual network 
there was also an additional  in license and maintenance fees as well as  in additional consulting fees 
the remaining portion of the increase was due to individually insignificant items 
network operations expenses increased slightly as a percentage of revenue as we continued to increase both the capacity and redundancy of our virtual network 
to the extent we expand our operations  we expect that our network operations expenses will increase in absolute dollars  and increase slightly as a percentage of revenues 
the increase in network operations expenses in over in absolute dollars was due primarily to million in additional compensation and benefits expense due to an increase in personnel   of additional transaction center fees  and  of additional depreciation expense on network operations equipment in support of the expansion of our virtual network 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues from 
table of contents to was due primarily to our ability to scale our network operations infrastructure without a proportionate increase in network operations expenses 
research and development research and development expenses consist of compensation and benefits for our research and development personnel  consulting  and certain allocated overhead costs 
december  change change in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses as a percent of revenue the increase in research and development expenses in over was due primarily to an additional million of compensation and benefits expenses related to an increase in headcount  and approximately million in fees paid to consultants to further develop our service 
the increase as a percentage of revenues was due to the acceleration of our development of new products as well as the increase in research and development personnel as a result of the two acquisitions that occurred in we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we develop and enhance new and existing service offerings as well as integrate newly acquired products and technologies into our existing products 
we also expect research and development expenses to increase slightly as a percentage of revenues as we continue to increase headcount and bring new and upgraded products and services to market 
the increase in research and development expenses in over was due primarily to an additional million of compensation and benefits expenses related to an increase in headcount  and approximately  in fees paid to consultants to further develop our service 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues was due to revenues increasing at a faster pace than research and development expenses 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation  benefits  advertising  promotion expenses  and certain allocated overhead costs 
december  change change in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue the increase in sales and marketing expenses in over in absolute dollars was due primarily to an additional million in compensation and benefits expenses resulting from the expansion of the sales organization in the emea and asia pacific regions  as well as the additional sales personnel from the acquisition of mobile automation in the last quarter of the increase also included million of additional advertising and public relations expenses  as well as a  increase in compensation and benefits expenses for additional marketing personnel 
the remaining portion of the increase was due to individually insignificant items 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars to the extent revenues increase and or we expand our sales force and increase marketing activities  but will remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenues 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in over in absolute dollars was due primarily to an additional million in compensation and benefits expenses resulting from the expansion of the sales organization and increased commissions expense as a result of sales growth in over the increase also included million of additional advertising and public relations expenses  as well as a  
table of contents increase in compensation and benefits expenses for additional marketing personnel 
the remaining portion of the increase was due to individually insignificant items 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and benefits of general and administrative personnel  legal and accounting expenses  bad debt expense  and certain allocated overhead costs 
december  change change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue a significant part of the increase in general and administrative expenses in over was million in compensation and benefits expenses for additional personnel and million for directors and officers insurance premiums 
there was also a million increase in legal and accounting fees 
these increases were offset in part by decreases in various individually insignificant accounts 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars to the extent that we expand our operations  but to remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenues 
a significant part of the increase in general and administrative expenses in over was million in compensation and benefits expenses for additional personnel 
there was also an increase of million for directors and officers insurance  as well as  for consulting  and an  increase in rent expense 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars in over due to incurring additional costs associated with becoming a public company 
amortization of stock based compensation we record stock based compensation charges in the amount by which the option exercise price or the restricted stock purchase price is less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
we amortize this compensation expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the applicable agreements  generally four years 
amortization of stock based compensation expense relates to stock options granted to employees prior to our initial public offering in july of december  change change in thousands  except percentages amortization of stock based compensation expense as a percent of revenue we expect to incur amortization of stock based compensation expense of at least million in and  in the amount of amortization of stock based compensation expense to be recognized in future periods could decrease if stock options for which accrued but unvested compensation expense has been recorded are forfeited 
non operating expenses other income expense  net other income expense consists of the net total of interest income and interest expense for the period 
interest income includes interest income on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances 
interest income and other was million  million and  for the years ended december  
table of contents and  respectively 
the increase in interest income was due to an increase in the average cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances for the period  resulting primarily from proceeds received from the initial public offering in july interest expense consists of interest paid on our line of credit and loans  as well as amortization of a loan discount associated with the fair value of warrants issued in connection with our financing activities 
interest expense was  and million in and  respectively 
there was no interest expense for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense from to was the result of paying off our line of credit and all outstanding loans payable in july and august provision for benefit from income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in compared to a provision of million in the increase is due to an increase in taxable income in over we incurred net operating losses in and consequently paid insignificant amounts of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
as of december   we had recorded a valuation allowance of million  which was equal to the amount of our deferred tax assets 
these assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between items recorded for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
we established this valuation allowance because we determined that it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
we reversed the valuation allowance totaling million during fiscal year  of which million was due to taxable earnings generated during  and million because we determined that it is more likely than not that we will generate enough taxable income to use our net operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources from our inception in july through our initial public offering of our common stock in july  we funded our operations primarily through issuances of preferred stock  which provided us with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in july  we completed the sale of  shares of common stock in an initial public offering  including the underwriters exercise of an over allotment option  and realized net proceeds of million 
we used million of the net proceeds to pay off all outstanding balances on loans payable and line of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the expansion of our business  as reflected in the increase in net income before taxes from to net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in was from the purchases of million in short term investments  offset by the maturities of short term investments in the amount of million 
net cash used in investing activities also included million for the acquisition of safew and mobile automation as well as million for the purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities in was from the purchases of property and equipment  with the exception of a net investment of million in short term investments as a result of the receipt of the proceeds from our initial public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in was the result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock for employee stock options plus the repayment of shareholder notes receivable 
in comparison  cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to net proceeds from our initial public offering  offset in part by the payment of all outstanding balances on our line of credit and loans payable 
net cash provided by financing activities in were primarily due to net proceeds from loans payable as well as proceeds from payments on stockholder notes receivable 

table of contents we anticipate that our operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months  including working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
commitments at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we have signed contracts with some network service providers under which we have minimum purchase commitments that expire on various dates through february other than in the approximately countries in which our sole network provider is equant  we have contracted with multiple network service providers to provide alternative access points in a given geographic area 
in those geographic areas where we have access through multiple providers  we are able to direct users to the network of particular service providers 
consequently  we believe we have the ability to fulfill our minimum purchase commitments in these geographic areas 
future minimum purchase commitments under all agreements as of december  are as follows in thousands year ending december we lease our facilities under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through february future minimum lease payments under these operating leases as of december  are as follows in thousands year ending december tabular disclosure of contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total yr years years yrs operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents factors affecting operating results set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks relating to our business if we are unable to meet the challenges posed by broadband access  our ability to grow our business will be impaired 
we have generated substantially all of our usage revenues to date from the sale of enterprise connectivity services using narrowband technologies such as modem dial up 
in some countries  including the united states  the use of narrowband as a primary means of enterprise connectivity has declined and is expected to continue to decline over time as broadband access technologies  such as cable modem  dsl  and wi fi  become more broadly used 
although we have not generated substantial revenues from broadband access  a substantial portion of the growth of our business may depend upon our ability to expand the broadband elements of our virtual network 
such an expansion may not result in additional revenues to us 
key challenges in expanding the broadband elements of our virtual network include the broadband access market is at an early stage of development 
although we derive revenues from wired and wireless broadband hotspots  such as particular airports  hotels and convention centers  the broadband access market  particularly for wireless access  is at an early stage of development and demand at levels we anticipate may not develop 
in particular  the market for enterprise connectivity services through broadband is characterized by evolving industry standards and specifications and there is currently no uniform standard for wireless access 
we have developed and made available wi fi specifications that are directed at enabling wi fi access points to become ready for use by enterprise customers 
if this specification is not widely adopted  market acceptance of our wireless broadband services may be significantly reduced or delayed and our business could be harmed 
furthermore  although the use of wireless frequencies generally does not require a license in the united states and abroad  if wi fi frequencies become subject to licensing requirements  or are otherwise restricted  this would substantially impair the growth of wireless access 
some large telecommunications providers and other stakeholders that pay large sums of money to license other portions of the wireless spectrum may seek to have the wi fi spectrum become subject to licensing restrictions 
if the broadband wireless access market does not develop  we will not be able to generate revenues from broadband wireless access 
the broadband service provider market is highly fragmented 
due to the early stage of development of the broadband access market  there are currently many wired and wireless broadband service providers that provide coverage in only one or a small number of hotspots 
we have entered into contractual relationships with numerous broadband service providers 
these contracts generally have an initial term of two years or less 
as this process is in the early stages  we must continue to develop relationships with many providers on terms commercially acceptable to us in order to provide adequate coverage for our customers mobile workers and to expand our broadband coverage 
we may also be required to develop additional technologies in order to integrate new broadband services into our service offering 
if we are unable to develop these relationships or technologies  our ability to grow our business could be impaired 
in addition  if broadband service providers consolidate  our negotiating leverage with providers may decrease  resulting in increased rates for access  which could harm our operating results 
we do not generate revenues from broadband home access 
we do not generate revenues when mobile workers access their enterprise networks from the home using subscription based broadband access because they do not connect through our virtual network 
if subscription based broadband access from the home increases and fewer home workers use narrowband access  our revenues may decline 
if demand for broadband access does not materially increase  or if demand increases but we do not meet the challenges outlined above  our ability to grow our business may suffer 

table of contents our customers require a high degree of reliability in our services  and if we cannot meet their expectations  demand for our services will decline 
any failure to provide reliable network access  uninterrupted operation of our network and software infrastructure  or a satisfactory experience for our customers and their mobile workers  whether or not caused by our own failure  could reduce demand for our services 
in  we experienced three outages affecting our clearinghouse system  which handles invoicing to our customers and network service providers  resulting in five days of outages and eight days of work to confirm data integrity in response to the outages 
although these problems did not affect the ability of mobile workers to access our services or impact our revenues  one of these outages caused a delay in our invoicing of approximately one week 
if additional outages occur  or if we experience other hardware or software problems  our business could be harmed 
we face strong competition in our market  which could make it difficult for us to succeed 
we compete primarily with facilities based carriers as well as with other non facilities based network operators 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories or greater name recognition than we have 
also  with the recent introduction of our policy management services  we face additional competition from companies that provide security and policy based services and software 
in addition  we face the following challenges from our competitors many of our competitors can compete on price 
because many of our facilities based competitors own and operate physical networks  there may be little incremental cost for them to provide additional telephone or internet connections 
as a result  they may offer dial up remote access services at little additional cost  and may be willing to discount or subsidize remote access services to capture other sources of revenue 
in contrast  we have traditionally purchased network access from facilities based network service providers to enable our dial up remote access service 
as a result  large carriers may sell their remote access services at a lower price 
in addition  new non facilities based carriers may enter our market and compete on price 
in either case  we may lose business or be forced to lower our prices to compete  which could reduce our revenues 
many of our competitors offer additional services that we do not  which enables them to compete favorably against us 
some of our competitors provide services that we do not  such as local exchange and long distance services  voicemail and digital subscriber line  or dsl  services 
potential customers that desire these services on a bundled basis may choose to obtain remote access and policy management services from the competitor that provides these additional services 
our potential customers may have other business relationships with our competitors and consider those relationships when deciding between our services and those of our competitors 
many of our competitors are large facilities based carriers that purchase substantial amounts of products and services  or provide other services or goods unrelated to remote access services 
as a result  if a potential customer is also a supplier to one of our large competitors  or purchases unrelated services or goods from our competitor  the potential customer may be motivated to purchase its remote access services from our competitor in order to maintain or enhance its business relationship with that competitor 
if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer s internal network  our virtual network may be perceived as not being secure and enterprises may curtail or stop using our services 
it is imperative for our customers that access to their mission critical data is secure 
a key component of our ability to attract and retain customers is the security measures that we have engineered into our network for the authentication of the end user s credentials  on a going forward basis  we expect an additional key component in this regard to be our policy management services 
these measures are designed to protect against unauthorized access to our customers networks 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures against unauthorized access or sabotage 
if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our services  the market perception of the effectiveness of 
table of contents our security measures could be harmed 
to date  we have not experienced any significant security breaches to our network 
if enterprise connectivity demand does not continue to expand  we may experience a shortfall in revenues or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations 
the growth of our business is dependent  in part  upon the increased use of enterprise connectivity services and our ability to capture a higher proportion of this market 
if the demand for enterprise connectivity services does not continue to grow  then we may not be able to grow our business  maintain profitability or meet public market expectations 
increased usage of enterprise connectivity services depends on numerous factors  including the willingness of enterprises to make additional information technology expenditures  the availability of security products necessary to ensure data privacy over the public networks  the quality  cost and functionality of these services and competing services  the increased adoption of wired and wireless broadband access methods  and the proliferation of electronic devices and related applications 
if we are unable to meet the challenges related to the market acceptance and provision of our policy management services  our ability to grow the business may be harmed 
we expect that the growth of our business may depend in part upon whether our policy management services will achieve and sustain expected levels of demand and market acceptance 
if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our policy management services  then the market for these services may not develop at all  or it may develop more slowly than we expect  either of which could significantly and adversely affect our growth 
in addition  if demand for our policy management services does not materialize as expected  our ability to recover our investment in safew  inc and mobile automation  inc 
may be impaired or delayed 
in addition  because of our limited operating history relating to policy management services  we cannot predict our revenue and operating results from the provision of these services 
key challenges that we face related to our provision of these services include the risk that we may encounter unexpected technical and other difficulties in developing our policy management services which could delay or prevent the development of these services or certain features of these services  the risk that the rate of adoption by enterprises of network security software or integrated secure connectivity solutions will not be as we anticipate  which if slow would reduce or eliminate the purchase of these services  and the risk that security breaches may occur  notwithstanding the use of our policy management services  by hackers that develop new methods of avoiding security software 
if we do not adequately address these challenges  our growth and operating results may be negatively impacted 
our long sales and service deployment cycles require us to incur substantial sales costs that may not result in related revenues 
our business is characterized by a long sales cycle between the time a potential customer is contacted and a customer contract is signed 
in addition  the downturn in the economy and the resulting reduction in corporate spending on internet infrastructure have further lengthened the average sales cycle for our services 
furthermore  once a customer contract is signed  there is typically an extended period before the customer s end users actually begin to use our services  which is when we begin to realize revenues 
as a result  we may invest a significant amount of time and effort in attempting to secure a customer which may not result in any revenues 
even if we enter into a contract  we will have incurred substantial sales related expenses well before we recognize any related revenues 
if the expenses associated with sales increase  we are not successful in our sales efforts  or we are unable to generate associated offsetting revenues in a timely manner  our operating results will be harmed 

table of contents there are approximately countries in which we provide dial up access only through equant 
the loss of equant as a dial up network service provider would substantially diminish our ability to deliver global network access 
in approximately countries  our sole dial up network service provider is equant 
network usage from access within these countries accounted for less than of our revenues for the years ended december  and if we lose access to equant s network and are unable to replace this access in some or all of these countries  our revenues would decline 
in addition  our ability to market our services as being global would be impaired  which could cause us to lose customers 
although our agreement with equant does not expire until february  equant may terminate the agreement earlier if we materially breach the contract and fail to cure the breach  or if we become insolvent 
in addition  equant has no obligation to continue to provide us with access to its network after february if equant were to cease operations or terminate its arrangements with us  we would be required to enter into arrangements with other dial up network service providers  which may not be available 
this process could be costly and time consuming  and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on terms acceptable to us 
if our channel partners do not successfully market our services to their customers or corporate end users  then our revenues and business may be adversely affected 
we sell our services directly through our sales force and indirectly through our channel partners  which include network service providers  systems integrators and value added resellers 
our business depends on the efforts and success of these channel partners in marketing our services to their customers 
our own ability to promote our services directly to their customers is often limited 
many of our channel partners may offer services to their customers that may be similar to  or competitive with  our services 
therefore  these channel partners may be reluctant to promote our services 
if our channel partners fail to market our services effectively  our ability to grow our revenue would be reduced and our business will be impaired 
if we fail to address evolving standards and technological changes in the enterprise connectivity and policy management services industry  our business could be harmed 
the market for enterprise connectivity and policy management services is characterized by evolving industry standards and specifications and rapid technological change  including new access methods  devices  applications and operating systems 
in developing and introducing our services  we have made  and will continue to make  assumptions with respect to which features  security standards  performance criteria  access methods  devices  applications and operating systems will be required or desired by enterprises and their mobile workers 
if we implement technological changes or specifications that are different from those required or desired  or if we are unable to successfully integrate required or desired technological changes or specifications into our wired or wireless services  market acceptance of our services may be significantly reduced or delayed and our business could be harmed 
the telecommunications industry has experienced a dramatic decline  which may cause consolidation among network service providers and impair our ability to provide reliable  redundant service coverage and negotiate favorable network access terms 
the telecommunications industry has experienced dramatic technological change and increased competition that have led to significant declines in network access pricing 
in addition  the revenues of network service providers have declined as a result of the general economic slowdown 
as a result  network service providers have experienced operating difficulties in the last several years  resulting in poor operating results and a number of these providers declaring bankruptcy 
as these conditions have continued  some of these service providers have consolidated and are working to consolidate or otherwise cease operations  which would reduce the number of network service providers from which we are able to obtain network access 
as this occurs  while we expect that we will still be able to maintain operations and provide enterprise connectivity services with a small number of network service providers  we would potentially not be able to provide sufficient redundant access points in some geographic areas  which could diminish our ability to provide broad  reliable  
table of contents redundant coverage 
further  our ability to negotiate favorable access rates from network service providers could be impaired  which could increase our network access expenses and harm our operating results 
our software is complex and may contain errors that could damage our reputation and decrease usage of our services 
our software may contain errors that interrupt network access or have other unintended consequences 
if network access is disrupted due to a software error  or if any other unintended negative results occur  such as the loss of billing information  a security breach or unauthorized access to our virtual network  our reputation could be harmed and our business may suffer 
although we generally attempt by contract to limit our exposure to incidental and consequential damages  if these contract provisions are not enforced or enforceable for any reason  or if liabilities arise that are not effectively limited  our operating results could be harmed 
because much of our business is international  we encounter additional risks  which may reduce our profitability 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from business conducted internationally 
revenues from customers domiciled outside of the united states were of our revenues for  of which approximately and were generated in our emea europe  middle east and africa and asia pacific regions  respectively 
in  revenues from customers domiciled outside of the united states were of our total revenues  of which approximately and were generated in our emea and asia pacific regions  respectively 
although we currently bill for our services in us dollars  our international operations subject our business to specific risks 
these risks include longer payment cycles for foreign customers  including delays due to currency controls and fluctuations  the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the attractiveness of our pricing  high taxes in some foreign jurisdictions  difficulty in complying with internet related regulations in foreign jurisdictions  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting these rights 
any of these factors could negatively impact our business 
completed or future acquisitions or investments could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders  cause us to incur significant expenses or harm our operating results 
integrating any newly acquired businesses  technologies or services may be expensive and time consuming 
for example  we completed the acquisitions of safew  inc in september and mobile automation  inc 
in october to finance any acquisitions  it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and  in the case of equity financings  would result in dilution to our stockholders 
in the case of completed or future acquisitions  we may be unable to operate any acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement our strategy successfully 
if we are unable to integrate any newly acquired entities  such as safew  inc and mobile automation  inc  or technologies effectively  our operating results could suffer 
completed acquisitions by us  such as the aforementioned safew  inc and mobile automation  inc 
transactions  or future acquisitions by us could also result in large and immediate write offs or assumption of debt and contingent liabilities  either of which could harm our operating results 
if we are unable to effectively manage future expansion  our business may be adversely impacted 
we have experienced  and in the future may experience  rapid growth in operations which has placed and could continue to place  a significant strain on our network operations  development of services  internal 
table of contents controls and other managerial  operating  and financial resources 
if we do not manage future expansion effectively  our business will be harmed 
to effectively manage any future expansion  we will need to improve our operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures  which include the following managing our research and development efforts for new and evolving technologies  expanding the capacity and performance of our network and software infrastructure  developing our administrative  accounting and management information systems and controls  and effectively maintaining coordination among our various departments  particularly as we expand internationally 
we currently are  and in the future may be  subject to securities class action lawsuits due to decreases in our stock price 
we are at risk of being subject to securities class action lawsuits if our stock price declines substantially 
securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
for example  in june  we announced that we would not meet market expectations regarding our financial performance in the second quarter  and our stock price declined 
on january   a lawsuit entitled palumbo v 
ipass  inc  et al  case no 
c mhp was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california  purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who purchased the company s stock between april  and june  the complaint alleges claims under sections b and a of the securities and exchange act of against the company and certain of its officers and directors 
several similar lawsuits were subsequently filed in the same court 
we cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits 
if our stock price declines substantially in the future  we may be the target of similar litigation 
the current  and any future  securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  and could seriously harm our business 
litigation arising from disputes involving third parties could disrupt the conduct of our business 
because we rely on third parties to help us develop  market and support our service offerings  from time to time we have been  and we may continue to be  involved in disputes with these third parties 
if we are unable to resolve these disputes favorably  our development  marketing or support of our services could be delayed or limited  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if licenses to third party technologies  including our license with rsa security  do not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or at all  our business and operations may be adversely affected 
we license technologies from several software providers that are incorporated in our services 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
in particular  we license encryption technology from rsa security 
the license agreement with rsa security expires in february and automatically renews for additional three year periods unless terminated by us or by rsa security 
licenses from third party technologies  including our license with rsa security  may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or at all 
the loss of these technologies or other technologies that we license could have an adverse effect on our services and increase our costs or cause interruptions or delays in our services until substitute technologies  if available  are developed or identified  licensed and successfully integrated into our services 
litigation arising out of intellectual property infringement could be expensive and disrupt our business 
we cannot be certain that our products do not  or will not  infringe upon patents  trademarks  copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties  or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
from time to time we have been  and we may continue to be  involved in disputes with these third parties 
any claim of infringement of proprietary rights of others  even if ultimately decided in our favor  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
successful claims against us may result in an injunction or substantial monetary liability  in either case which could significantly impact our results of 
table of contents operations or materially disrupt the conduct of our business 
if we are enjoined from using a technology  we will need to obtain a license to use the technology  but licenses to third party technology may not be available to us at a reasonable cost  or at all 
new and potential new accounting pronouncements may impact our future financial position and results of operations 
there may be potential new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings  which may have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations 
in particular  in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards r sfas r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  which eliminated the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r will instead require companies to recognize compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to share based payments including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas r is effective for public companies in periods beginning after june  we will be required to implement the standard no later than the quarter that begins july  the cumulative effect of adoption  if any  applied on a modified prospective basis  would be measured and recognized on july  the adoption of fas r and other potential changes could materially impact our results of operations 
risks relating to our industry security concerns may delay the widespread adoption of the internet for enterprise communications  or limit usage of internet based services  which would reduce demand for our products and services 
the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a significant barrier to further adoption of the internet as a business medium 
the internet is a public network and information is sent over this network from many sources 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of code breaking or other developments could result in compromised security on our network or the networks of others 
security and authentication concerns with respect to the transmission over the internet of confidential information  such as corporate access passwords and the ability of hackers to penetrate online security systems may reduce the demand for our services 
further  new access methods  devices  applications and operating systems have also introduced additional vulnerabilities which have been actively exploited by hackers 
internet based worms and viruses  computer programs that are created to slow internet traffic or disrupt computer networks or files by replicating through software or operating systems  are examples of events or computer programs that can disrupt users from using our internet based services and reduce demand for our services  potentially affecting our business and financial performance 
in particular  certain internet worms and viruses affected some of our customers and their mobile users  which may have negatively impacted our revenues 
furthermore  any well publicized compromises of confidential information may reduce demand for internet based communications  including our services 
financial  political or economic conditions could adversely affect our revenues 
our revenues and profitability depend on the overall demand for enterprise connectivity services 
the general weakening of the global economy in the last few years led to decreased corporate spending on internet infrastructure 
in addition  if there are further acts of terrorism  if hostilities involving the united states and other countries continue or escalate  or if other future financial  political  economic and other uncertainties or natural disasters arise  this could lead to a reduction in travel  including by business travelers who are substantial users of our services  and continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue growth and financial results 
government regulation of  and legal uncertainties regarding  the internet could harm our business 
internet based communication services generally are not subject to federal fees or taxes imposed to support programs such as universal telephone service 
changes in the rules or regulations of the us federal 
table of contents communications commission or in applicable federal communications laws relating to the imposition of these fees or taxes could result in significant new operating expenses for us  and could negatively impact our business 
any new law or regulation  us or foreign  pertaining to internet based communications services  or changes to the application or interpretation of existing laws  could decrease the demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise harm our business 
there are an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet 
these laws or regulations may relate to taxation and the quality of products and services 
furthermore  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement  taxation  encryption  obscenity  libel  employment  personal privacy  export or import matters and other issues is uncertain and developing and we are not certain how the possible application of these laws may affect us 
some of these laws may not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes in laws intended to address these issues could create uncertainty in the internet market  which could reduce demand for our services  increase our operating expenses or increase our litigation costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency although we currently bill our services in us dollars  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a strengthening of the dollar could make our services less competitive in foreign markets and therefore could reduce our revenues 
we are billed by and pay substantially all of our network service providers in us dollars 
in the future  some portion of our revenues and costs may be denominated in foreign currencies 
to date  exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results 
interest rate sensitivity as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaling million 
our investment portfolio consists of money market funds and securities  asset backed securities  corporate securities  and government securities  generally due within one to two years 
all of our instruments are held other than for trading purposes 
we place investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities are subject to interest rate risks 
based on our portfolio content and our ability to hold investments to maturity  we believe that  a hypothetical increase or decrease in current interest rates would not materially affect our interest income  although there can be no assurance of this 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which consisted of cash and highly liquid short term investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase  which we held solely for non trading purposes 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates would have caused the interest generated by  and the fair value of  these short term investments to change by an immaterial amount 
the following is a chart of the principal amounts of short term investments by expected maturity in thousands expected maturity date for par value amounts for the year ended as of december  dec 
 total cost value total fair value us government agencies corporate notes total our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we consider all investments to be short term investments  which are classified in the 
table of contents balance sheet as current assets  because the investments can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity and the investments are selected for yield management purposes only and we are not committed to holding the investments until maturity 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date 
all short term investments and cash equivalents in our portfolio are classified as available for sale and are stated at fair market value  with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of unrealized discounts to maturity 
such amortization and accretion is included in interest income and other  net 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method
