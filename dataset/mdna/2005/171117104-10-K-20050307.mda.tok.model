item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for the last several years  the us furniture industry has experienced declining sales primarily due to low cost import competition 
foreign manufacturers  primarily in china  have a substantial labor and overhead cost advantage as compared to furniture manufacturers in the united states 
in addition  china s government continues to hold its currency value pegged to the us dollar  which has helped to keep its goods cheaper  thereby increasing its exports 
off shore furniture manufacturing is rapidly expanding  causing us plant closings  lost jobs and companies exiting the business 
we expect these competitive conditions to continue 
in response to the lower sales level  the company has reduced costs and lowered employment levels 
the company s strategy is to operate autonomous niche focused businesses to serve the fragmented furniture distribution channel with product selection and service 
a key element in this strategy is to maintain a low cost structure to insure that the company s products are a value to the customer 
to achieve this goal  the company has increased imports of low cost  labor intensive furniture components and finished furniture from overseas 
using this blended approach of domestic manufacturing and selective importing  the company believes it is better able to control the quality of furniture and service to its customers 
chromcraft revington s competitiveness with producers from other countries is influenced by transportation costs  timely delivery of furniture to retailers and product differentiation 
the company has several businesses  some of which have been impacted more severely than others by the reduced sales volume 
chromcraft revington is closely monitoring this situation and  if business conditions do not improve  this could cause asset impairment and restructuring charges in the future 
also  the company s operating units have experienced inflationary price increases in raw materials and other costs 
the company is seeking ways to mitigate this impact through product engineering  offshore sourcing of low cost inventory components and material substitution 
due to the competitive environment  the company may not be able to pass through any significant cost increases to its customers
