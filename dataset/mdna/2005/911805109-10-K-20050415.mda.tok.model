item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of significant factors  which have affected the company s liquidity  capital resources and results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
due to uncertainties in the minerals business  the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in any such forward looking statements 
general overview us energy corp 
use or the company and its subsidiaries historically have been involved in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of properties prospective for hard rock minerals including lead  zinc  silver  molybdenum  gold  uranium  oil and gas and commercial real estate 
the company manages all of its operations through a joint venture  usecc joint venture usecc  with one of its subsidiary companies  crested corp 
crested of which it owns a consolidated 
the narrative discussion of this md a refers only to use or the company but includes the consolidated financial statements of crested  rocky mountain gas  inc rmg  plateau resources ltd 
plateau  usecc and other subsidiaries 
the company has entered into partnerships through which it either joint ventured or leased properties with non related parties for the development and production of certain of its mineral properties 
due to either depressed metal market prices or disputes in certain of the partnerships  all mineral properties have either been sold  reclaimed or are shut down except coalbed methane 
however  activities have resumed on a limited basis in uranium and gold 
see items and above 
the company has had no production from any of its mineral properties during the periods from may  through december   except coalbed methane 
the company formed rmg to enter into the coalbed methane cbm business in the acquisition of leases and acreage for the exploration  development and production of coalbed methane became the primary business focus of the company 
at december   the company on a consolidated basis  owned of rmg 
rmg has purchased or leased acreage for cbm exploration and development 
rmg has entered into various agreements and joint operating agreements to develop and produce coalbed methane from these properties 
management of the company plan to create value in rmg by growing rmg into an industry recognized producer of cbm 
management believes the fundamentals of natural gas supply and demand are  and will remain favorable well into the future 
management further believes that the investments the company has made in rmg will provide a solid base of cash flows into the future 
the price that rmg receives for the sale of its coalbed methane is based on the colorado interstate gas index cig for the northern rockies 
historically  the highest prices realized on the cig over a twelve month period are during the months of december and january and the lowest prices realized are during the months of late summer or early fall 
the following table represents a summary of historical cig prices prices per mcf month high month low month average december although management believes that gas prices will increase over the long term from present levels  no assurance can be given that will happen 
gas prices are directly affected by weather conditions  which impact heating and cooling requirements  electrical generation needs and the amount of gas being produced by those companies in the gas production business 
many of the company s industry competitors are very large international companies that are well funded 
all of these factors are variable and cannot be accurately predicted 
in the first quarter  the company obtained  of equity funding from an accredited investor  shares of use common stock  three year warrants to purchase  shares of use common stock  at per share  and five year warrants to purchase  shares at per share 
in the third quarter  we borrowed  from geddes and company of phoenix  arizona 
the loan matures on july   bears annual interest  and is secured principally by rmg s cbm properties in the castle rock prospect and  shares of rmg stock held by the company 
the loan may be prepaid in cash without penalty  but the lender at any time may convert loan principal to rmg common stock at per share on the first  converted  and at  and per share for each additional  converted 
in connection with the loan  rmg issued to the lender five year warrants to buy  shares of common stock of rmg per share for  shares  and  and per share for  shares at each price 
in the first quarter  rmg raised  of equity financing from the sale of shares of  shares of series a preferred stock in rmg  and warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the company  to institutional investors 
proceeds were used to pay part of the hi pro acquisition price  and for rmg working capital 
as of march   all series a preferred stock including dividends have been converted to and paid with  shares of the company s common stock 
additionally the institutional investors exercised all  of their warrants for which the company received  during the fourth quarter of and  during the first quarter of on january   rmg organized a wholly owned subsidiary rmg i  llc for the purchase of producing and non producing cbm properties the hi pro properties near gillette  wyoming 
rmg i  llc rmg i  a wholly owned subsidiary of rmg  purchased cbm properties from hi pro for  rmg and the company participated in raising equity capital and mezzanine financing for this transaction 
during the last six months of the year ended december  and the first quarter of uranium  gold and molybdenum market prices have experienced significant increases 
due to these increased market price conditions and industry projected prices over the foreseeable future  the company is in the process of re evaluating its mineral properties for these metals 
management of the company is developing plans to maximize the value of existing properties and is in the process of acquiring and in some cases re acquiring uranium properties 
a major component of the company s future cash flow projections is the ultimate resolution of litigation with nukem  inc nukem over issues relating to sheep mountain partners smp assets 
on august   the u 
s 
district court of colorado entered a judgment in favor of the company and use against nukem in the amount of  nukem appealed this judgment to the th circuit court of appeals th cca and usecc cross appealed 
oral arguments were heard by the th cca on september  on february   a three judge panel of the th cca vacated the judgment of the us district court and remanded the case to the panel for clarification of the order and award 
in remanding this case  the th cca stated the arbitration award in this case is silent as to the definition of purchase rights and the profits therefrom  including the valuation of either 
also unstated in the award is the duration of the constructive trust and whether and what costs should be deducted when computing the value of the constructive trust 
further  the arbitration panel failed to address whether prejudgment interest should be awarded on the value of the constructive trust 
as a result  the district court s valuation of the constructive trust was based upon extensive guesswork 
therefore  a remand to the arbitration panel for clarification is necessary  despite the long and tortured procedural history of this case 
management is not able to predict the timing and ultimate outcome of the nukem litigation 
we do however believe that the ultimate outcome will not have an adverse affect on our financial condition or results of operations 
on february   the us district court of colorado entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in a case involving the company  crested and phelps dodge corporation authorizing the return of the mt 
emmons molybdenum properties and associated water treatment plant to the company and crested 
usecc has filed a motion with the court to amend the order to determine that the decreed water rights be conveyed to usecc 
the motion is pending 
the ultimate impact of this decision on the financial statements of the company in management s opinion will not be measurable until such time as the final decisions are reached and the property actually transferred to usecc 
critical accounting policies asset impairments we assess the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
oil and gas producing activities we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves  including directly related overhead costs  are capitalized and are subject to ceiling tests to insure the carrying value does not exceed the fair market value 
reclamation liabilities the company s policy is to accrue the liability for future reclamation costs of its mineral properties based on the current estimate of the future reclamation costs as determined by internal and external experts 
revenue recognition revenues are reported on a gross revenue basis and are recorded at the time services are provided or the commodity is sold 
sales of proved and unproved properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas  in which case the gain or loss is recognized in income 
abandonments of properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no loss recognized 
use of accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   operations resulted in a loss of  and consumed  of cash 
investing activities also consumed cash in the amount of  primarily as a result of the purchase of additional cbm properties and the exploration expenses incurred on existing cbm properties 
financing activities generated  as a result of the sale of the company s and rmg s stock and third party debt 
all these factors together resulted in a net reduction of cash and cash equivalents of cash generated by the production of coalbed methane gas operations during the year ended december  was swept by the financing entities to pay principal and interest 
prior to the sweep of the cash for principal and interest payments  sufficient cash to pay well and field operating costs was advanced to rmg 
rmg also receives a per well monthly fee of  net to rmg  average per well for operating the coalbed methane operations from the working interest owners 
the liquidity of the company during the year ended december  was dependant therefore upon the sale of equity and increased debt to third parties 
the company anticipates repaying the debt once it is able to sell certain mineral or coalbed methane properties 
capital resources as of april   the company and its subsidiary rocky mountain gas  inc rmg has entered into a binding agreement with enterra energy trust enterra for the acquisition of rmg by enterra in consideration of  payable pro rata to the rmg shareholders in the amounts of  in cash and  in exchangeable shares of one of the subsidiary companies of enterra 
the shares will be exchangeable for units of enterra twelve months after closing of the transaction 
the enterra units are traded on the toronto stock exchange and on nasdaq  the exchangeable shares will not be traded 
rmg will be acquired with approximately  of debt owed to its mezzanine lenders 
two major components of anticipated future capital resources during therefore are the settlement of the litigation with nukem and the sale of rmg to enterra 
should the sale of rmg common stock to enterra be concluded the company will receive cash and trust units of enterra which would be marketable in months after the closing of the transaction 
management believes both these transactions will be concluded favorably  however  the ultimate outcome of the nukem litigation and the enterra transaction are not certain 
during the year ended december   the company sold its interests in the town site operations to a non affiliated entity  the cactus group cactus 
as a result of the sale of the town site  the company received cash of  and a promissory note from cactus in the amount of  the company received  in cash payments and  in room credits from cactus during calendar the room credits will be used by the company as it works on developing its uranium assets in southern utah 
cactus is to continue making monthly payments  primarily interest  until august at which time a balloon payment of million is due 
the company has a  line of credit with a commercial bank 
the line of credit is secured by certain real estate holdings and equipment 
at december   the full line of credit was available to the company and has been renewed by the bank through june  this line of credit is used for short term working capital needs associated with operations 
on february   the company borrowed  from seven accredited investors  issuing  face amount of debentures including three years of annual interest at 
net proceeds to the company were  after paying a commission and lenders legal costs 
the debentures are unsecured  the face amount of the debentures are payable every six months from february   in five installments of  in cash or in restricted common stock of the company 
we may pay this amortization payment in cash or in stock at the lower of per share the set price or of the volume weighted average price of the company s stock for the trading days prior to the repayment date 
the set price was determined on the formula of of the volume weighted average price of the stock over the trading days prior to february  the debentures are convertible to restricted common stock of the company at the set price 
at any time  the company has the right to redeem some or all of the debentures in cash or stock  in an amount equal to of the face amount of the debentures until february   from february  to february   and from february  until maturity 
payment in stock would be at the set price 
the holders may convert the debentures to stock even if use should seek to redeem in cash 
if at any time  after registration for public resale of the conversion shares have been approved  the company s stock trades at more than of the set price for consecutive trading days  use may convert the balance of the face amount of the debentures at the set price 
in the event of default  the investors may require payment i in cash equal to of the then outstanding face amount  or ii in stock equal to of face amount  with the stock priced at the set price  or iii in stock equal to of the face amount  with the stock priced at of the volume weighted average price of our stock for the trading days prior to default 
the company issued warrants to the investors  expiring february   to purchase  shares of restricted common stock  at per share equal to of the nasdaq closing price on february  
the number of shares underlying the warrants equals of the shares issuable on full conversion of the debentures at the set price as if the debentures were so converted on february  
warrants to purchase an additional  shares  at the same price and for the same term as the warrants issued to the investors  were a registered broker dealer as compensation for its services in connection with the transaction 
if in any period of consecutive trading days after registration has been approved the stock price of the company s common stock exceeds of the warrants exercise price  on each of the trading days  all of the warrants will expire on the th day after the company sends a call notice to the warrant holders 
during the quarter ended march   the company received  from the exercise of  warrants by non employee individuals and firms 
the continued exercise of employee options and non employee warrants is contingent upon the market price of the company s common stock remaining above the exercise prices 
other sources of capital are cash on hand  collection of receivables  contractual funding of drilling and development programs by non affiliates  sale of excess equipment and real estate properties  additional debt or equity financings through third parties  equity financing of the company s subsidiaries and a line of credit with a commercial bank 
capital requirements the capital requirements of the company during remain its general and administrative costs and expenses  the funding of costs associated with the maintenance and operation of its coalbed methane properties  permitting and development work on its gold property and the ongoing maintenance of its uranium properties 
additionally  pending the outcome of the litigation with phelps dodge  the company may incur the costs associated with holding the molybdenum property 
although it is not known what the exact cost of maintaining the molybdenum properties is  it has been represented that the cost is approximately million per year 
maintaining uranium properties smp uranium properties the average monthly care and maintenance costs associated with the sheep mountain uranium mineral properties was  during the year ended december  included in the average monthly cost during the year ended december  is ongoing reclamation work on the former smp properties 
it is anticipated that a total of  in reclamation expenditures will be conducted during on december   the company and crested d b a usecc entered into a purchase and sale agreement the agreement with bell coast capital corp 
now uranium power corp 
upc  a british columbia corporation tsx v upc v for the sale to upc of an undivided interest in the former smp uranium properties

see items and above 
plateau resources uranium properties plateau owned the ticaboo townsite  motel  convenience store  boat storage  restaurant and lounge 
during the year ended december   the company sold its interest in the townsite operations to a non affiliated entity  cactus 
as a result of the sale of the townsite  usecc received a promissory note from cactus in the amount of  the company received  in cash payments and  in room credits from cactus during calendar additionally  plateau owns and maintains the shootaring canyon uranium mill the shootaring mill 
during the year ended december   plateau requested a change in the status of the shootaring mill from active to reclamation from the nrc 
the nrc granted the change in license status which generated a surplus in the cash bond account of approximately million which was released to plateau 
the company received the benefit of this release of cash 
during the years ended december  and  plateau performed approximately   respectively in reclamation on mining properties and the shootaring mill 
due to increases in the market price for uranium during the last six months of the year ended december  and the first quarter of  the company reconsidered its prior decision to reclaim the shootaring mill property 
in march  plateau filed an application with the state of utah to restart the mill 
therefore  the company will not expend any capital resources in the reclamation of the mill during calendar the cash costs per month  including reclamation costs  at the plateau properties during calendar were approximately  per month 
these costs are projected to increase to  to  per month during the year ending december  due to increased activity in the uranium business 
sutter gold mining inc sgmi properties because of the recent increase in the price of gold  management of sutter gold has decided to place the properties controlled by it into production 
no extensive development work or mill construction will be initiated until such time as funding from debt and or equity sources is in place 
the goal of the company s management is to have the sgmi properties be self supporting and thereby not requiring any capital resource commitment from the company 
on december   sgmc merged with globemin resources  inc  a canadian company  and changed its name to sutter gold mining inc 
sgmi 
sgmi is traded on the tsx venture exchange 
sgmi has sufficient capital to pay for the anticipated work which will be done on the properties during calendar additional financing is being sought by sgmi 
s ee note f development of coalbed methane properties a portion of the costs during the year ended december  for the development of rmg s coalbed methane properties were funded through an agreement that rmg entered into with ccbm  inc ccbm a subsidiary of carrizo oil and gas of houston  texas 
at december   ccbm had completely satisfied its cash and drilling commitments to rmg 
during the year ended december   rmg and ccbm entered into a subscription and contribution agreement with credit suisse first boston private equity parties csfb to form pinnacle gas resources  inc pinnacle 
as a result of the formation  rmg and ccbm contributed certain undeveloped and producing coalbed methane properties to pinnacle 
rmg has the opportunity to increase its ownership in pinnacle by advancing cash to purchase common stock in pinnacle through the exercise of options  but that increase would be offset to the extent other parties contribute additional capital to pinnacle 
see part i transaction with pinnacle gas resources  inc management of the company does not anticipate exercising these options during calendar unless surplus capital resources are received 
rmg has no capital commitments on the properties contributed to pinnacle 
see note f rmg continues to pursue other investment and production opportunities in the cbm business 
on january   rmg purchased the assets of hi pro production  llc a non affiliated entity which included both producing and non producing properties 
the purchase of these cbm assets was accomplished by the issuance of common stock and warrants of both rmg and use and cash  the majority of which was borrowed as a result of mezzanine financing through petrobridge investment management  llc 
see part i acquisition of producing and non producing properties from hi pro production  llc and note f to the financial statements in this annual report 
all cash flows from gas production on the hi pro properties are pledged to pay the acquisition debt 
see note f to the financial statements in this annual report and part i  acquisition of producing and non producing properties form hi pro production  llc 
the acquisition debt also requires minimum net production volumes through june  and maintenance of financial ratios 
the hi pro properties are held by rmg i  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of rmg and are the sole collateral for the debt 
at december   rmg i was not in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the petrobridge agreement 
a revocable waiver was granted through january  by the lender 
as the wavier is conditional  the entire debt is classified as current 
management of rmg i continues to seek solutions in the production of coalbed methane gas to bring the project into compliance 
due to lower than projected sales volumes  the hi pro field will remain out of compliance unless higher prices are realized  costs are reduced and the debt is paid down 
because it is probable that rmg i will not be in compliance with these ratios for the next reporting period the entire  is classified as current debt 
should the lender declare the note in default  the only asset available for recourse is the hi pro property owned by rmg i 
see note f 
future equity financing by rmg  or industry financings  will be needed for rmgi  llc to drill and complete wells on the substantial undeveloped acreage acquired from hi pro 
new production from this acreage could be needed to service the acquisition debt to offset the impact of declining production from the producing properties and or low gas prices 
as of april   the company  use  and rmg signed a binding agreement for the acquisition of rmg by enterra energy trust 
see capital resources above 
if the proposed transaction with enterra is not consummated  management of the company believes that continued exploration and development of rmg s unproven properties will be financed through cash that rmg and use have on hand as well as ventures with industry partners 
none of the company s capital resources should be needed therefore to fund operations or development work of rmg during debt payments debt to non related parties at december  was  net of a discount of  this debt consists of debt owed by rmg i to mezzanine lenders to purchase the hi pro assets of million  long term debt related to the purchase of vehicles and a corporate aircraft of million  and convertible debt of million 
the commitment of capital resources during calendar for equipment and liability insurance debt is  the mezzanine lenders for the hi pro acquisition sweep all funds from operations of the field to pay interest and principal with the exception of funds to pay a lease operating expenses  b royalties and c production related taxes 
at december   rmg i was not in compliance with five of the financial covenants under the petrobridge agreement see note f 
a rev ocable waiver was granted through january  by the lender 
as the waiver is conditional  the entire debt is classified as current 
the convertible debt is not due until so will only require  of the company s capital resources to pay interest when due quarterly 
reclamation costs the asset retirement obligations are substantially long term and are either bonded through the use of cash bonds or the pledge of assets 
it is anticipated that  of reclamation work on the smp properties in wyoming will be performed during the asset retirement obligation on the plateau uranium mining and milling properties in utah at december  was  which is reflected on the balance sheet 
this liability is fully funded by cash investments that are recorded as long term restricted assets 
due to the increased market price of uranium  the reclamation of this property has been delayed significantly and is not anticipated to commence until the asset retirement obligation of the sheep mountain uranium properties in wyoming at september  are  and are covered by a reclamation bond which is secured by a pledge of certain real estate assets of the company and crested 
rmg asset retirement obligations at september  were  it is not anticipated that any reclamation work will commence on the coalbed methane properties during the asset retirement obligation for sgmi is  which is covered by a cash bond 
no cash resources will be used for asset retirement obligations at sgmi during the twelve months ended december  liquidity summary the company s capital resources during the year ended december  were sufficient to fund mine standby costs  coalbed methane property acquisition  maintenance and operations  limited reclamation and general and administrative expenses 
the anticipated development of our gold  uranium  molybdenum and coalbed methane gas properties will require additional funding 
this funding will be derived either through joint ventures with industry participants  debt or equity financings 
the current market prices for gold  uranium  molybdenum and coalbed methane gas are at levels that will warrant the exploration and development of the company s mineral properties 
industry projections for all these metals along with gas anticipate prices remaining at the current levels or higher during the next decade 
management of the company therefore believes that sufficient capital will be available to develop its mineral properties 
the successful development and production of these properties will greatly enhance the liquidity and financial position of the company 
results of operations during the periods presented  the company has discontinued certain operations 
reclassifications to previously published financial statements have therefore been made to reflect ongoing operations and the effect of the discontinued operations 
the company changed its year end to december effective december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues operating revenues during the year ended december  increased significantly over those recognized during the prior year 
the primary cause of this increase is as a result of the purchase of producing coalbed methane properties by rmg during the first quarter of the company recognized  in gas sales during the twelve months ended december  as compared to only  during the prior year 
the gas sales during the year ended december  were only for six months due to the formation of pinnacle and the contribution of all of the company s producing properties to that entity 
the acquisition of producing gas properties also increased management fee revenues recognized by the company during the year ended december  this increase came as a result of the company being paid a per well fee for the operation of the wells by the other working interest owners as well as a monthly fee for employees who manage the day to day production of the producing properties 
during the year ended december  the company recognized  in management revenues as a result of these activities 
no similar revenues were recognized during the year ended december  revenues from real estate operations decreased during the year ended december  from those recorded during the year ended december  by  this decrease was as a result of reduced lot sales at the plateau operations in utah 
all other revenues for the year ended december  remained constant with those recognized during the previous year 
costs and expenses as a result of the company purchasing and operating coalbed methane properties during the year ended december   the costs associated with gas operations increased significantly from  to  these costs and expenses reflect the costs of operations  repairs and maintenance and amortization of the purchase price on a units of production basis 
the field which was purchased by the company had not been well maintained for some time and therefore required major repairs and enhancements 
although the operation of a gas field constantly requires ongoing maintenance  it is not anticipated by management that the major enhancement costs will be required in the future as the company has  and is committed to  perform the required maintenance on an ongoing basis 
the enhancements and maintenance perfo rmed during the year ended december  have increased production and improved both the cash flow and results of operations relating to the gas property 
the production on all gas properties has a life certain and therefore begins to decline the longer the property is produced 
the gas property that the company purchased is on that decline curve and it is not known how long the property will continue to produce at its current levels 
there are however additional coal seams that the management of the company is evaluating for future development and production 
the overall cost of the property is therefore anticipated to remain static  however  if the lower coals are not placed into production  the profitability of the property will decrease 
the holding costs associated with the company s mineral properties during the year ended december  remained constant with those costs recorded during the previous year 
it is anticipated that these costs will increase during as the company moves forward with the permitting process relating to its uranium and gold properties 
additionally the holding cost of the molybdenum property  which the company most probably will receive back from phelps dodge  will increase these costs 
all costs associated with the acquisition of additional properties will be capitalized but the permitting costs will be expensed 
real estate operating costs and general and administrative costs were reduced during the year ended december  from those of the year ended december  the reduction of real estate costs is insignificant   and is related to the reduction of the company s involvement in the southern utah property sold to a third party which had previously been operated by plateau 
the reduction in general and administrative costs of  was due to the ongoing efforts of the company s management to reduce overhead and related expenses 
other income and expenses other income and expenses increased from net expenses of  during the year ended december  to net income of  during the year ended december  although the net increase of  is insignificant there were some major changes in the individual components 
due to the positive upward movement of the market prices for the minerals in which the company is involved it has determined to retain its remaining mineral development and extraction equipment 
the determination to retain this equipment is a direct cause of the reduction of  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  in the gain on the sale of assets 
the income recognized from the sale of investments is as a result of the liquidation of common stock of a company  ruby mining company ruby  which the company sold several years ago 
the company retained ownership of a portion of its former shares of common stock in ruby and had no book basis in the shares 
during the year ended december  the company sold  shares of ruby common stock and received  the company also received  from the sale of a piece of real estate during the year ended december  which had no book value 
interest revenues recognized during the year ended december  decreased from those recognized during the year ended december  due to the reduced amount of cash invested in interest bearing accounts 
interest expenses increased from  during the twelve months ended december  by  to  at december  as a result of increased debt associated with the purchase of coalbed methane properties 
net loss high and non recurring remediation and maintenance costs associated with the new coalbed methane producing property resulted in a net loss from those operations of  this loss is offset by an increase of management fees of  which is directly tied to the operations of coalbed methane properties 
increased interest expenses and reduced interest revenues are therefore the primary causes for the increase in the loss of  during the year ended december  to  as compared to the loss during the year ended december  of  these losses reflect net losses per share of per share and per share for the years ended december  and respectively 
year ended december  compared to the year ended may  revenues revenues for the twelve months ended december  consisted of  from real estate operations   from gas sales and  from management fees 
revenues from real estate operations during the fiscal year ended may  were  the decrease in real estate revenues was as a result of reduced sales of commercial real estate during the twelve months ended december  during fiscal the company sold a tract of land in california which was no longer needed for the sgmc development plan for operations 
during the year ended december  the company reported  in gas sales 
there were no similar revenues during the twelve months ended may  as the company had no production of coal bed methane gas at may  the company recognized a minimal increase in management fee revenues during the year ended december  to  over the  recognized in management fee revenues during the twelve months ended may  management fee revenues were actually reduced after june when rmg contributed its producing and certain undeveloped properties to pinnacle 
although rmg provided the transitional accounting services for pinnacle through december   it received only its actual cost for those services 
costs and expenses costs and expenses for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended may  costs and expenses of real estate operations and the cost of real estate sold decreased by  during that twelve months ended december  when compared to the costs and expenses incurred during the fiscal year ended may  this decrease was primarily as a result of a tract of no longer needed 
real estate was sold by sgmc during the year ended may  while no similar sales occurred during the year ended december  during the year ended december  the company recognized  in gas operating expenses 
no similar expenses were recorded during the fiscal year ended may  as the company had not yet begun producing gas at that time 
mineral holding costs decreased by  to  at december  from  at may  this decrease was as a result of the company placing all its mining properties on a shut down status and reducing costs of holding those properties 
general and administrative costs increased by  during the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended may  this increase was as a result of several non cash items 
non cash items which were expensed during the year ended december  were depreciation and amortization of  accretion of asset retirement obligations of  amortization of debt discount of  amortization of non cash services of  and non cash compensation of  for a total of  the amortization of debt discount increased primarily as a result of the acceleration in the discount amortization due to the conversion of approximately one half of the debt under the terms of million of debt to common shares of the company s common stock 
on january   the company adopted sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligation 
under the terms of this accounting standard  the company is required to record the fair value of the reclamation liability on its shut down mining and gas properties as of the date that the liability was incurred 
the accounting standard further requires the company to review the liability and determine if a change in estimate is required as well as accrete the total liability for the future liability 
as a result of the adoption of this accounting standard  the company recorded the non cash accretion of  non cash compensation increased as a result of the initial funding of the stock award plan whereby five of the executive officers of the company were granted a total of  shares of common stock at per share 
under the plan  each officer is to receive  shares of common stock annually under the condition that the shares cannot be sold until the officer s death or retirement 
the plan was effective in and had not been funded 
the funding for the twelve months ended december was therefore retroactive for two years 
in addition to the increase due to the funding of the stock award plan  the funding for the esop as well as the amortization of the deferred compensation recorded in prior periods were both for a full twelve months as compared to only seven months in the prior p eriod 
the increase in the amortization of non cash services during the year ended december  resulted from the issuance of additional stock and warrants for legal and financial consulting services 
these services related to the formation of pinnacle and litigation with phelps dodge 
other income and expenses during the fiscal year ended may  the company recognized  in gains from the sale of assets while during the year ended december  the company recognized only  the company was selling the majority of its construction equipment during the years ended may  and the majority of the surplus equipment to be sold was sold during those two years 
interest income decreased  during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended may  this reduction in revenues occurred as a result of the company having less amounts of cash invested in interest bearing accounts during the year ended december  in may of the company borrowed million from third party lenders

future operations we have generated operating losses for the years ended december  and  the seven months ended december  and the fiscal year ended may  as a result of costs associated with shut down mineral properties 
management of the company intends to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the recent and future projected market prices for all the minerals and coalbed methane gas that it is involved with 
effects of changes in prices mineral operations are significantly affected by changes in commodity prices 
as prices for a particular mineral increase  prices for prospects for that mineral also increase  making acquisitions of such properties costly  and sales advantageous 
conversely  a price decline facilitates acquisitions of properties containing that mineral  but makes sales of such properties more difficult 
operational impacts of changes in mineral commodity prices are common in the mining industry 
natural gas and oil 
our decision to expand into the coalbed methane industry were predicated on the projections for natural gas prices 
we believe that the energy demands of the united states of america will sustain higher natural prices 
as a result of rmg s hedging activities  the price of gas will not materially affect our operations for fiscal uranium and gold 
changes in the prices of uranium and gold will affect our operational decisions the most 
currently  both gold and uranium have experienced an increase in price 
we continually evaluate market trends and data and are seeking financing or a joint venture to place the company s gold and uranium properties in production
