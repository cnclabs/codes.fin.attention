item business historical we are a florida corporation organized in we develop and operate outpatient kidney dialysis centers that provide quality dialysis and ancillary services to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure  generally referred to as end stage renal disease  or esrd 
we also provide acute inpatient dialysis treatments in hospitals  homecare services and dialysis center management services 
we became a public company in  and went private in we began construction of new centers in  and in once again became a public company 
we currently operate outpatient dialysis facilities including a dialysis center in ohio in which we hold a interest and an unaffiliated center in georgia  each of which we manage pursuant to management services agreements 
during  we opened five dialysis centers one in each of maryland  pennsylvania  and south carolina and two in virginia and acquired a pennsylvania dialysis company that had been operating two centers 
we are in the process of developing five new centers one in maryland  one in ohio and three in south carolina

recent developments the company and its parent  medicore  inc  agreed to terms for a merger of medicore into our company in a stock for stock merger transaction 
this was announced in a joint release on march  we are currently working toward completion of an agreement and plan of merger 
medicore  also a public company trading on the nasdaq smallcap market mdki  currently owns approximately of our company 
the merger is subject to the receipt of satisfactory tax and fairness opinions  the filing of a registration statement including a proxy statement prospectus with the sec  and the approval of the shareholders of medicore and our company 
assuming completion of the merger  we anticipate issuing 
shares of our common stock for each share of medicore common stock for an aggregate issuance of approximately  shares  which will result in approximately  of our shares of common stock to be outstanding upon completion of the merger 
the bases for the merger are essentially to simplify the corporate structure  enable the ownership of the control interest in our company to be in the hands of the public rather than one entity  and provide to our company the medicore assets  which include  among other assets  minimum cash of approximately  to  the medical supply operations  and income producing realty in hialeah  florida  with an estimated value of at least  indebtedness of approximately  at march  which we owe to medicore under a financing arrangement provided by medicore of up to  will be eliminated 
the credit facility is for equipment financing  working capital and general corporate purposes 
these assets to be obtained in the merger will enhance our liquidity and borrowing power  and provide our company with the ability to continue our business strategy of controlled growth  further build our dialysis business  and expand the acquired medical supply operations 
we are preparing for filing with the sec in the near future a registration statement on form s containing a proxy statement prospectus  as well as an information statement for our company in connection with the merger transaction

general management believes the company distinguishes itself on the basis of quality patient care  and a patient focused  courteous  highly trained professional staff 
in addition to outpatient facilities  we provide acute inpatient dialysis treatments that are conducted under contractual relationships 
currently we have such relationships with nine hospitals and medical centers located in areas and states serviced by our outpatient dialysis facilities 
our homecare services  through the use of peritoneal dialysis  requires us to provide equipment and supplies  training  monitoring and follow up assistance to patients who are able to perform their treatments at home 
our growth depends primarily on the availability of suitable dialysis centers for development or acquisition in appropriate and acceptable areas  and our ability to develop new potential dialysis centers at costs within our budget 
we opened five new dialysis centers during one in virginia in january   one in south carolina in february   one in pennsylvania in march   one in maryland in june  and another in virginia in december  at the end of august  we acquired a dialysis company which owns and operates two dialysis centers in pennsylvania 
we are in the process of developing five additional dialysis centers one in maryland  one in ohio and three in south carolina 
our medical service revenues are derived primarily from four sources i outpatient hemodialysis services  and of medical services revenues for  and  respectively  ii home peritoneal dialysis services   and of medical services revenues for  and  respectively  iii inpatient hemodialysis services for acute patient care provided through agreements with hospitals and medical centers  and of medical services revenues for  and  respectively  and iv ancillary services associated with dialysis treatments  primarily the administration of erythropoietin epo  a bio engineered protein that stimulates the production of red blood cells a deteriorating kidney loses its ability to regulate red blood cell count  resulting in anemia   and of medical services revenue for  and  respectively 
dialysis is an ongoing and necessary therapy to sustain life for kidney dialysis patients 
esrd patients normally receive dialysis treatments each year 
essential to our operations and income is medicare reimbursement which is a fixed rate determined by the center for medicare and medicaid services cms of the department of health and human services hhs 
the level of our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected by future legislation that could result in rate cuts 
further  our operating costs tend to increase over the years in excess of increases in the prescribed dialysis treatment rates 
from commencement of the medicare esrd program in through  the esrd composite rate was unchanged  and thereafter decreased over the years until january   when the rate was minimally increased by congress  and further minimally increased in january  however  congress has approved a composite rate increase for for calendar  medicare is implementing an additional change in the manner it reimburses dialysis treatments  which includes a pricing revision to the current average wholesale price for separately billable drugs and biologicals 
prepayment will be based on the average acquisition price as determined by the office of inspector general  referred to as oig 
in order to make this change budget neutral  a drug add on component has been included  which will increase our composite rate by an additional 
further  medicare intends to implement a case mix payment system  adjusting the composite rate for a limited number of patient characteristics 
see under this item  operations medicare reimbursement below 
commercial third party reimbursement rates  which have increased as a percentage of our revenues over the last two years  are also susceptible to reduction 
see operations medicare reimbursement 
the inpatient dialysis service agreements for treating acute kidney disease are not subject to government fixed rates  but rather are negotiated with hospitals 
typically these rates are at least equivalent to or higher than the government fixed rates on a per treatment basis 
stock split on january   the company effected a two for one stock split 
all share and per share data  including option information  in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
dialysis industry kidneys act as a filter removing harmful substances and excess water from the blood  enabling the body to maintain proper and healthy balances of chemicals and water 
chronic kidney failure  esrd  results from chemical imbalance and buildup of toxic chemicals  and is a state of kidney disease characterized by advanced irreversible renal impairment 
esrd is a likely consequence of complications resulting from diabetes  hypertension  advanced age  and specific hereditary  cystic and urological diseases 
esrd patients  in order to survive  must either obtain a kidney transplant  which procedure is limited due to lack of suitable kidney donors and the incidence of rejection of transplanted organs  or obtain dialysis treatments for the rest of their lives 
based upon information published by cms  the number of esrd patients requiring dialysis treatments in the united states at december  was approximately  and continues to grow at a rate of approximately a year 
this is thought to be attributable primarily to the aging of the population and greater patient longevity as a result of improved dialysis technology 
the statistics further reflect approximately  dialysis facilities  with a current annual cost for treating esrd patients in the united states at approximately billion at december   of which medicare accounted for approximately billion 
esrd treatment options treatment options for esrd patients include hemodialysis  performed either at i an outpatient facility  or ii inpatient hospital facility  or iii the patient s home  peritoneal dialysis  either continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis  and or kidney transplant 
a significant portion of esrd patients receive treatments at non hospital owned outpatient dialysis facilities according to cms  approximately with most of the remaining patients treated at home through hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis 
patients treated at home are monitored by a designated outpatient facility 
the most prevalent form of treatment for esrd patients is hemodialysis  which involves the use of an artificial kidney  known as a dialyzer  to perform the function of removing toxins and excess fluids from the bloodstream 
this is accomplished with a dialysis machine  a complex blood filtering device which takes the place of certain functions of the kidney  and also controls external blood flow and monitors the toxic and fluid removal process 
the dialyzer has two separate chambers divided by a semi permeable membrane  and simultaneously with the blood circulating through one chamber  dialyzer fluid is circulated through the other chamber 
the toxins and excess fluid pass through the membrane into the dialysis fluid 
on the average  patients usually receive three treatments per week with each treatment taking three to five hours 
dialysis treatments are performed by teams of licensed nurses and trained technicians pursuant to the staff physician s instructions 
home hemodialysis treatment requires the patient to be medically suitable and have a qualified assistant 
additionally  home hemodialysis requires training for both the patient and the patient s assistant  which usually encompasses four to eight weeks 
our company does not currently provide home hemodialysis non peritoneal services 
a second home treatment for esrd patients is peritoneal dialysis 
there are several variations of peritoneal dialysis  the most common being continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis 
all forms of peritoneal dialysis use the patient s peritoneal abdominal cavity to eliminate fluid and toxins from the patient 
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis utilizes dialysis solution infused manually into the patient s peritoneal cavity through a surgically placed catheter 
the solution is allowed to remain in the abdominal cavity for a three to five hour period and is then drained 
the cycle is then repeated 
continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis is performed in a manner similar to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis  but utilizes a mechanical device to cycle the dialysis solution while the patient is sleeping 
peritoneal dialysis is the third most common form of esrd therapy following center hemodialysis and renal transplant 
while kidney transplantation  another treatment option for patients with esrd  is typically the most desirable form of therapeutic intervention  the scarcity of suitable donors and possibility of donee rejection limits the availability of this surgical procedure as a treatment option 
business strategy dialysis corporation of america has years experience in developing and operating dialysis treatment facilities 
our priority is to provide quality patient care 
we intend to continue to establish alliances with physicians and hospitals and attempt to initiate dialysis service arrangements with nursing homes and managed care organizations 
we continue to actively seek and negotiate with physicians and others to establish new outpatient dialysis facilities 
we are in the process of developing five new dialysis centers  and we are in different phases of negotiations with physicians for potential new facilities in a variety of states 
same center growth we endeavor to increase same center growth by adding quality staff and management and attracting new patients to our existing facilities 
we seek to accomplish this objective by rendering high caliber patient care in convenient  safe and pleasant conditions 
we believe that we have adequate space and stations within our facilities to accommodate greater patient volume and maximize our treatment potential 
during fiscal  we experienced approximately growth in the total number of dialysis treatments at our dialysis centers that were in existence as of december   and a growth in medical services revenue for these centers 
we had an increase of over in peritoneal dialysis patients in fiscal development and acquisition of facilities one of the primary elements in developing or acquiring facilities is locating an area with an existing patient base under the current treatment of local nephrologists  since the proposed facility would primarily be serving such patients 
other considerations in evaluating development of a dialysis facility or a proposed acquisition are the availability and cost of qualified and skilled personnel  particularly nursing and technical staff  the size and condition of the facility and its equipment  the atmosphere for the patients  the area s demographics and population growth estimates  state regulation of dialysis and healthcare services  and the existence of competitive factors such as existing outpatient dialysis facilities within reasonable proximity to the proposed center 
expansion is approached primarily through the development of our own dialysis facilities 
acquisition of existing outpatient dialysis centers is a faster but more costly means of growth 
the primary reason for physicians selling or participating in the development of independently owned centers is the avoidance of administrative and financial responsibilities  freeing their time to devote to their professional practice 
other motivating forces are the physician s desire to be part of a larger organization allowing for economies of scale and the ability to realize a return on their investment if they have an interest in the dialysis entity 
to construct and develop a new facility ready for operation takes an average of six to eight months  and approximately months or longer to generate income  all of which are subject to variables based on location  size and competitive elements 
some of our centers are in the developmental stage  since they have not reached the point where the patient base is sufficient to generate and sustain earnings 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
construction of a station facility  typically the size of our dialysis facilities  costs in a range of  to  including equipment and initial working capital requirements  depending on location  size and related services to be provided by the proposed facility 
acquisition of existing facilities can be substantially more expensive  and is usually based primarily upon the patient base and earnings  and to a lesser extent  location and competition 
any significant expansion  whether through acquisition or development of new facilities  is dependent upon existing funds or financing from other sources 
we have a financing arrangement with our parent for up to  for equipment financing and working capital 
at march   we had borrowed  which is under a demand promissory note at an annual interest rate of prime plus 
assuming completion of the merger with our parent  we would obtain  among other assets  approximately  to  in cash for building our dialysis operations 
see recent developments above 
inpatient services we also seek to increase acute dialysis treatments through contracts with hospitals for inpatient dialysis services 
these contracts are sought with hospitals in areas serviced by our facilities 
hospitals are willing to enter into such inpatient care arrangements to eliminate the administrative burdens of providing dialysis services to their patients as well as the expense involved in maintaining dialysis equipment  supplies and personnel 
we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our operations  since the contract rates are individually negotiated with each hospital and are not fixed by government regulation as is the case with medicare reimbursement fees for esrd patient treatment 
there is no certainty as to when any additional centers or service contracts will be implemented  or  to the extent implemented  the number of dialysis stations or patient treatments these centers or service contracts may involve  or if they will ultimately be profitable 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to enter into favorable relationships with physicians who would become medical directors of such proposed dialysis facilities  or that we will be able to acquire or develop any new dialysis centers within a favorable geographic area 
newly established dialysis centers  although contributing to increased revenues  also adversely affect results of operations due to their start up costs and expenses and to their having a smaller and slower developing patient base 
see business strategy  operations and competition of this item  and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operations location  capacity and use of facilities we operate outpatient dialysis facilities in georgia  maryland  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia and south carolina  including an ohio dialysis center in which we hold a interest and which we operate in conjunction with the majority owner  the medical director of that center  and an unaffiliated center in georgia which we manage 
these dialysis facilities have a total designed capacity of licensed stations 
of our dialysis facilities are owned through subsidiaries of which are owned by us  eight owned by us as a majority owner in conjunction with the medical directors of those centers who hold minority interests  and one of which we hold a minority interest  and which we manage under contract 
we also manage an unaffiliated dialysis center in georgia 
one of the pennsylvania and one of the georgia dialysis centers are located on properties that we own and lease to our subsidiaries 
our cincinnati  ohio dialysis center is leased from a corporation owned by the medical director of that center who  together with his wife  holds a minority interest in the subsidiary operating that center 
see item  properties 
additionally  the company provides acute care inpatient dialysis services to nine hospitals in areas serviced by our dialysis facilities 
we are in the process of negotiating additional acute dialysis services contracts in the areas surrounding our facilities and in tandem with development of future proposed sites 
furthermore  most of our dialysis facilities have the capacity to provide training  supplies and on call support services for home peritoneal patients 
dialysis corporation of america provided approximately  hemodialysis treatments in  an increase of approximately  treatments compared to fiscal we estimate that on average our centers were operating at approximately of capacity as of december   based on the assumption that a dialysis center is able to provide up to three treatments a day per station  six days a week 
we believe we can increase the number of dialysis treatments at our centers without making significant additional capital expenditures 
operations of dialysis facilities our dialysis facilities are designed specifically for outpatient hemodialysis and generally contain  in addition to space for dialysis treatments  a nurses station  a patient weigh in area  a supply room  water treatment space used to purify the water used in hemodialysis treatments  a dialyzer reprocessing room where  with both the patient s and physician s consent  the patient s dialyzer is sterilized for reuse  staff work area  offices and a staff lounge 
our facilities also have a designated area for training patients in home dialysis 
each facility also offers amenities for the patients  such as a color television with headsets for each dialysis station  to ensure the patients are comfortable and relaxed 
we maintain a team of dialysis specialists to provide for the individual needs of each patient 
in accordance with participation requirements under the medicare esrd program  each facility retains a medical director qualified and experienced in the practice of nephrology and the administration of a renal dialysis facility 
see physician relationships below 
each facility is overseen by an administrator who supervises the daily operations and the staff  which consists of registered nurses  licensed practical nurses  patient care technicians  a social worker to assist the patient and family to adjust to dialysis treatment and to provide help in financial assistance and planning  and a registered dietitian 
in addition  there are independent consultants who visit with our dialysis patients 
these individuals supervise the patient s needs and treatments 
see employees below 
in furtherance of our business strategy  we strive to attract and retain skilled nurses and other staff  competition for whom is intense 
our dialysis facilities offer high efficiency conventional hemodialysis  which  in our experience  provides the most viable treatment for most patients 
we consider our dialysis equipment to be both modern and efficient  providing state of the art treatment in a safe and comfortable environment 
our facilities also offer home dialysis  primarily continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis 
training programs for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis generally encompass two to three weeks at the dialysis facility  and such training is conducted by the facility s home training nurse 
after the patient completes training  they are able to perform treatment at home with equipment and supplies provided by the company 
inpatient dialysis services we presently provide inpatient dialysis services to nine hospitals in georgia  ohio and pennsylvania  under agreements either with us or with one of our subsidiaries in the area 
the agreements are for a term ranging from one to five years  with automatic renewal terms  subject to termination by notice of either party 
inpatient services are typically necessary for patients with acute kidney failure resulting from trauma or similar causes  patients in the early stages of esrd  and esrd patients who require hospitalization for other reasons 
ancillary services our dialysis facilities provide certain ancillary services to esrd patients  including the administration of certain prescription drugs  such as epo upon a physician s prescription 
epo is a bio engineered protein which stimulates the production of red blood cells and is used in connection with dialysis to treat anemia  a medical complication frequently experienced by esrd patients 
epo decreases the necessity for blood transfusions in esrd patients 
there is only one manufacturer of epo in the united states and there are currently no alternative products that perform the functions of epo available to dialysis treatment providers 
although we have a good relationship with this manufacturer and have not experienced any problems in receipt of our supply of epo  any loss or limitation of supply of this product could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and income 
physician relationships an integral element to the success of a facility is its association with area nephrologists 
a dialysis patient generally seeks treatment at a facility near the patient s home where the patient s nephrologist has an established practice 
consequently  we rely on our ability to develop affiliations with area nephrologists 
the conditions of a facility s participation in the medicare esrd program mandate that treatment at a dialysis facility be under the general supervision of a medical director who is a physician 
we retain  by written agreement  qualified physicians or groups of qualified physicians to serve as medical directors for each of our facilities 
generally  the medical directors are board eligible or board certified in internal medicine by a professional board specializing in nephrology and have had at least months of experience or training in the care of dialysis patients at esrd facilities 
the medical directors are typically a source of patients treated at the particular center served 
our dialysis centers are operated through subsidiaries  either corporations or limited liability companies 
the medical directors of eight of our centers have acquired a minority ownership interest in the center they service  and an ohio affiliate is majority owned by the medical director of that facility 
we make every effort to comply with federal and state regulations concerning our relationship with the physicians and the medical directors treating patients at our facilities 
see government regulation below 
we know of no limitations on physician ownership in our subsidiaries 
agreements with medical directors typically range from a term of five to years  with renewal provisions  usually two renewal options each for five years 
each agreement specifies the duties  responsibilities and compensation of the medical director 
under each agreement  the medical director or professional association maintains his  her or its own medical malpractice insurance 
the agreements also typically provide for non competition in a limited geographic area surrounding that particular dialysis center during the term of the agreement and upon termination for a limited period 
these agreements  however  do not prohibit physicians providing services at our facilities from providing direct patient care services at other locations  and consistent with the federal and state law  such agreements do not require a physician to refer patients to our dialysis centers 
usually  physician s professional fees for services are billed directly to the patient or to government payment authorities by the treating physician and paid directly to the physician or the professional association 
our ability to establish and operate a dialysis facility in a particular area is substantially dependent on the availability of a qualified physician or nephrologist to serve as the medical director 
the loss of a medical director who could not be readily replaced would have a material adverse effect on the operations of that facility  most likely resulting in closure 
compensation of medical directors is separately negotiated for each facility and generally depends on competitive factors  the size of the facility  and the fair market value of the services to be provided 
quality assurance dialysis corporation of america implements a quality assurance program to maintain and improve the quality of dialysis treatment and care we provide to our patients in each facility 
quality assurance activities involve the ongoing examination of care provided  the identification of therapy deficiencies  the need for any necessary improvements in the quality of care  and evaluation of improved technology 
specifically  this program requires each center s staff  including its medical director and nurse administrator  to regularly review quality assurance data and initiate programs for improvement  including dialysis treatment services  equipment  technical and environmental improvements  and staff patient and personnel relationships 
these evaluations are in addition to assuring regulatory compliance with cms and the occupational safety and health administration 
our vice president of clinical services  a certified nephrology nurse  oversees this program in addition to ensuring that we meet federal and state compliance requirements for our dialysis centers 
see government regulation below 
quality clinical results our goal is to provide consistent quality clinical care to our patients from caring and qualified doctors  nurses  patient care technicians  social workers and dieticians 
we have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to quality renal care through our continuous quality improvement initiatives 
we strive to maintain a leadership position as a quality provider in the dialysis industry and often set our goals higher than the national average standards 
kt v is a formula that measures the amount of dialysis delivered to the patient  based on the removal of urea  an end product of protein metabolism 
kt v provides a means to determine an individual dialysis prescription and to monitor the effectiveness or adequacy of the dialysis treatment as delivered to the patient 
it is critical to strive to achieve a kt v level of greater than for as many patients as possible 
the national average for  the most recent data available  indicated of dialysis patients had a kt v level greater than  while of our patients had a kt v level greater than  for and anemia is a shortage of oxygen carrying red blood cells 
because red blood cells bring oxygen to all the cells in the body  anemia causes severe fatigue  heart disorders  difficulty concentrating  reduced immune function  and other problems 
anemia is common among renal patients  caused by insufficient erythropoietin  iron deficiency  repeated blood losses  and other factors 
anemia can be detected with a blood test for hemoglobin or hematocrit 
it is ideal to have as many patients as possible with hemoglobin levels above the national average for indicated of dialysis patients had a hemoglobin level greater than  while of our patients had a hemoglobin level greater than  for and one indicator of the overall health of our patients is the number of days that are spent in the hospital 
the crude hospitalization rate is the total number of hospital days during a given year per total population 
hospitalization of patients can be related or unrelated to chronic kidney disease 
the national average for  the most recent data available  was hospital days per patient per year  while our average was hospital days per patient per year  for and patient revenues a substantial amount of the fees for outpatient dialysis treatments are funded under the esrd program established by the federal government under the social security act  and administered in accordance with rates set by cms 
a majority of dialysis patients are covered under medicare 
the balance of the outpatient charges are paid by private payors including the patient s medical insurance  private funds or state medicaid plans 
the states in which we operate provide medicaid or comparable benefits to qualified recipients to supplement their medicare coverage 
under the esrd program  payments for dialysis services are determined pursuant to part b of the medicare act which presently pays of the allowable charges for each dialysis treatment furnished to patients 
the maximum payments vary based on the geographic location of the center 
the remaining may be paid by medicaid if the patient is eligible  from private insurance funds or the patient s personal funds 
if there is no secondary payor to cover the remaining  medicare may reimburse us for part of that balance as part of our annual cost report filings 
medicare and medicaid programs are subject to regulatory changes  statutory limitations and government funding restrictions  which may adversely affect dialysis services payments and  consequently  our revenues 
see medicare reimbursement below 
the inpatient dialysis services are paid for by each contracted hospital pursuant to contractual pre determined fees for the different dialysis treatments 
medicare reimbursement we are reimbursed primarily by medicare under a prospective reimbursement system for chronic dialysis services  and by third party payors including medicaid and commercial insurance companies 
each of our dialysis facilities is certified to participate in the medicare program 
under the medicare system  the reimbursement rates are fixed in advance and limit the allowable charge per treatment  but provide us with predictable and recurring per treatment revenues and allows us to retain any profit earned 
an established composite rate set by cms governs the medicare reimbursement available for a designated group of dialysis services  including dialysis treatments  supplies used for such treatments  certain laboratory tests and medications 
other ancillary services and items are eligible for separate reimbursement under medicare and are not part of the composite rate  including certain drugs such as epo  the allowable rate for is per units for amounts in excess of three units per patient per year  and certain physician ordered tests provided to dialysis patients 
approximately of our medical services revenue in was derived from providing dialysis patients with epo 
cms limits the epo reimbursement based upon patients hematocrit levels 
other ancillary services  mostly other drugs  account for approximately an additional of our medical services revenue 
we submit claims monthly and are usually paid by medicare within days of the submission 
there have been a variety of proposals to congress for medicare reform 
we are unable to predict what  if any  future changes may occur in the rate of reimbursement 
congress has approved a composite rate increase for commencing this year  medicare will reimburse dialysis providers for the ten most utilized esrd drugs at an amount equal to the cost of such drugs as determined by the oig  and for other esrd drugs  medicare will reimburse at an amount equal to the average sale price of the drug plus  and the composite rate will be increased by an amount estimated by hhs to be the dialysis provider s average profit for these drugs 
to make this change budget neutral  a drug add on composite has been included 
accordingly  it has been determined by cms that the medicare esrd composite rate will increase by approximately or per treatment  and that payments for separately billable drugs will be reduced as described above 
in addition  it is anticipated that cms will begin as of april  to reimburse providers using a case mix formula 
cms plans to adjust reimbursements based on predefined patient parameters such as patient height  weight and age 
congress has mandated a budget neutrality factor adjustment so that aggregate payments under the system for equal payments that would have been made without the case mix adjustments and the add on composite for reimbursement of the drugs 
management believes that there will be minimal impact on its average medicare revenue per treatment as a result of these changes in medicare reimbursement 
this is the first increase in the medicare esrd composite rate since any reduction in the medicare composite reimbursement rate could have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues and net earnings 
medicaid reimbursement medicaid programs are state administered programs partially funded by the federal government 
these programs are intended to provide coverage for patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured 
the programs also serve as supplemental insurance programs for the medicare co insurance portion and provide certain coverages eg  oral medications that are not covered by medicare 
state reimbursements generally follow medicare reimbursement levels and coverages without any co insurance amounts 
certain states  however  require beneficiaries to pay a monthly share of the cost based upon levels of income or assets 
pennsylvania and new jersey have medical assistance programs comparable to medicaid  with primary and secondary insurance coverage to those who qualify 
we are a licensed esrd provider in georgia  maryland  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina and virginia

these services are provided for a percentage of net revenues of each particular facility 
corporate integrity program dialysis corporation of america has developed a corporate integrity program to assure it continues to achieve its goal of providing the highest level of care and service in a professional and ethical manner consistent with applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
this program is intended to i reinforce our management s  employees and professional affiliates awareness of their responsibilities to comply with applicable laws in the increased and complex regulatory environment relating to our operations  ii benefit the overall care and services for our dialysis patients  and iii assure our operations are in compliance with the law  which  in turn  should assist us in operating in a cost effective manner  and accordingly  benefit our shareholders 
our board of directors has established an audit committee consisting of three independent members of the board who oversee audits  accounting  financial reporting  and who have established procedures for receipt  retention and resolution of complaints relating to those areas none to date  among other responsibilities 
the audit committee operates under a charter providing for its detailed responsibilities 
we have developed a compliance program to assure compliance with fraud and abuse laws  enhance communication of information  and provide a mechanism to quickly identify and correct any problems that may arise 
this compliance program supplements and enhances our existing policies  including those applicable to claims submission  cost report preparation  internal audit and human resources 
code of ethics as part of our corporate integrity program  we have established a code of ethics and business conduct covering management and all employees to assure all persons affiliated with our company and our operations act in an ethical and lawful manner 
the code of ethics and business conduct covers relationships among and between affiliated persons  patients  payors  and relates to information processing  compliance  workplace conduct  environmental practices  training  education and development  among other areas 
in our commitment to delivering quality care to dialysis patients  we have mandated rigorous standards of ethics and integrity 
our code of ethics and business conduct is designed to provide ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships full  fair  accurate  timely  and understandable disclosure in reports and documents we file with the sec and in our other public communications compliance with applicable governmental laws  rules and regulations prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to an appropriate person identified in the code accountability for adherence to the code the portion of our code of ethics and business conduct as it applies to our principal executive officer  principal financial officer  principal accounting officer  and persons performing similar functions  may be obtained without charge upon request to our corporate secretary and counsel  lawrence e 
jaffe  esq  jaffe falk  llc  at terrace avenue  hasbrouck heights  new jersey the corporate integrity program is implemented  and reviewed and upgraded from time to time  to provide a highly professional work environment and lawful and efficient business operations to better serve our patients and our shareholders 
potential liability and insurance participants in the health care industry are subject to lawsuits based upon alleged negligence  many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs 
we are very proud of the fact that  although we have been involved in chronic and acute kidney dialysis services for approximately years  we have never been subject to any suit relating to the providing of dialysis treatments 
we currently have general and umbrella liability insurance  as well as professional and products liability 
our insurance policies provide coverage on an occurrence basis and are subject to annual renewal 
a hypothetical successful claim against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 
the medical directors supervising our dialysis operations and other physicians practicing at the facilities are required to maintain their own professional malpractice insurance coverage 
government regulation general regulation of healthcare facilities  including dialysis facilities  is extensive  with legislation continually proposed relating to safety  maintenance of equipment and proper records  quality assurance programs  reimbursement rates  confidentiality of medical records  licensing and other areas of operations 
each dialysis facility must be certified by cms  and we must comply with certain rules and regulations established by cms regarding charges  procedures and policies 
each dialysis facility is also subject to periodic inspections by federal and state agencies to determine if their operations meet the appropriate regulatory standards 
our operations are also subject to the occupational safety and health administration  known as osha  relating to workplace safety and employee exposure to blood and other potentially infectious material 
many states have eliminated the requirement to obtain a certificate of need prior to the establishment or expansion of a dialysis center 
there are no certificate of need requirements in the states in which we are presently operating 
our record of compliance with federal  state and local governmental laws and regulations remains excellent 
nevertheless  we are unable to predict the scope and effect of any changes in government regulations  particularly any modifications in the reimbursement rate for medical services or requirements to obtain certification from cms 
enforcement  both privately and by the government  has become more stringent  particularly in attempts to combat fraud and waste 
since our inception in  we have maintained all of our licenses  including our medicare and medicaid and equivalent certifications 
the loss of any licenses and certifications would have a material adverse effect on our operations  revenues and earnings 
we regularly review legislative and regulatory changes and developments and will restructure a business arrangement if we determine such might place our operations in material noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations 
see fraud and abuse and stark ii below 
to date  none of our business arrangements with physicians  patients or others have been the subject of investigation by any governmental authority 
no assurance can be given  however  that our business arrangements will not be the subject of future investigation or prosecution by federal or state governmental authorities which could result in civil and or criminal sanctions 
certification and reimbursement our dialysis centers must meet certain requirements  including  among others  those relating to patient care  patient rights  medical records  the physical set up of the center  and personnel  in order to be certified by cms  to be covered under the medicare program and to receive medicare reimbursement 
see above under operations medicare reimbursement 
all of our dialysis centers are certified under the medicare program and applicable state medicaid programs 
coverage for esrd services has been revised by cms for see in this item  operations medicare reimbursement above 
fraud and abuse certain aspects of our business are subject to federal and state laws governing financial relationships between health care providers and referral sources and the accuracy of information submitted in connection with reimbursement 
these laws  collectively referred to as fraud and abuse laws  include the anti kickback statute  stark ii  other federal fraud laws  and similar state laws 
the fraud and abuse laws apply because our medical directors have financial relationships with the dialysis facilities and also refer patients to those facilities for items and services reimbursed by federal and state health care programs 
financial relationships with patients who are federal program beneficiaries also implicate the fraud and abuse laws 
other financial relationships which bear scrutiny under the fraud and abuse laws include relationships with hospitals  nursing homes  and various vendors 
anti kickback statutes the federal anti kickback statute  derived from certain provisions of the social securities act of  prohibits the knowing and willful solicitation  receipt  offer  or payment of any remuneration  directly or indirectly  in return for or to induce the referral of patients or the ordering or purchasing of items or services payable under the medicare  medicaid  or other federal health care program 
sanctions for violations of the anti kickback statute include criminal penalties  such as imprisonment and fines of up to  per violation  and civil penalties of up to  per violation  as well as exclusion from medicare  medicaid  and other federal health care programs 
the language of the anti kickback statute has been construed broadly by the courts 
over the years  the federal government has published regulations that established safe harbors to the anti kickback statute 
an arrangement that meets all of the elements of the safe harbor is immunized from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
the failure to satisfy all elements  however  does not necessarily mean the arrangement violates the anti kickback statute 
some states have enacted laws similar to the anti kickback statute 
these laws may apply regardless of payor source  may include criminal and civil penalties  and may contain exceptions that differ from the safe harbors to the anti kickback statute 
as required by medicare regulations  each of our dialysis centers is supervised by a medical director  who is a licensed nephrologist or otherwise qualified physician 
the compensation of our company s medical directors  who are independent contractors  is fixed by a medical director agreement and reflects competitive factors in each respective location  the size of the center  and the physician s professional qualifications 
the medical director s fee is fixed in advance  typically for periods of one to five years and does not take into account the volume or value of any referrals to the dialysis center 
eight of our outpatient dialysis centers are owned jointly between us and physicians who  in most cases  hold a minority position through a professional association 
our ohio affiliate is majority owned by the medical director of that facility 
these physicians also act as the medical directors for those facilities 
we attempt to structure our arrangements with our physicians to comply with the anti kickback statute 
many of these physicians patients are treated at our facilities 
we believe that the value of the minority interest in a subsidiary acquired by the physician has been consistent with the fair market value of the cash consideration paid  assets transferred to  and or services performed by that physician for the subsidiary  and there is no intent to induce referrals to any of our centers 
see business physician relationships above 
we believe our arrangements with our medical directors are in material compliance with applicable law 
several states in which we operate have laws prohibiting physicians from holding financial interests in various types of medical facilities 
if these statutes are interpreted to apply to relationships we have with our medical directors who hold a percentage ownership in our dialysis facilities  we would restructure our relationship with these physicians but could be subject to penalties 
management believes that the anti kickback statute and other fraud and abuse laws are primarily directed at abusive practices that increase the utilization and cost of services covered by governmentally funded programs 
the dialysis services we provide generally cannot  by their very nature  be over utilized since dialysis treatment is not elective  and is only indicated when there is temporary or permanent kidney failure 
medical necessity is capable of being supported by objective documentation  drastically reducing the possibility of over utilization 
additionally  there are safe harbors for certain arrangements 
nevertheless  while relationships created by medical director ownership of minority interests in our facilities satisfy many but not all of the criteria for the safe harbor  there can be no assurance that these relationships will not subject us to investigation or prosecution by enforcement agencies 
in an effort to further our compliance with the law  we have adopted a corporate compliance program that addresses medical necessity and medical chart audits to confirm medical necessity of referrals 
with respect to our inpatient dialysis services  we provide hospitals with dialysis services  including qualified nursing and technical personnel  supplies  equipment and technical services 
in certain instances  the medical director of our dialysis center who has a minority interest in that facility may refer patients to hospitals with which we have an inpatient dialysis services arrangement 
we believe our acute inpatient hospital services are in compliance with the law 
see stark ii below 
we endeavor in good faith to comply with all governmental regulations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to change our practices or experience a material adverse effect as a result of any such potential challenge 
we cannot predict the outcome of the rule making process  enforcement procedures  or whether changes in the safe harbor rules will affect our position with respect to the anti kickback statute  but we will continue to make every effort to remain in compliance 
stark ii the physician ownership and referral act  known as stark ii  bans certain physician referrals  with exceptions for certain designated health services as defined in the statute  to entities in which a physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship which includes an ownership or investment interest in  or a compensation arrangement between the physician and the entity 
for purposes of stark ii  designated health services include  among others  clinical laboratory services  durable medical equipment  parenteral and enteral nutrients  home health services  and inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
dialysis treatments are not included in the statutory list of designated health services 
this ban is subject to several exceptions  including personal service arrangements  employment relationships and group practices meeting specific conditions 
if stark ii is found to be applicable to the facility  the entity is prohibited from claiming payment for such services under the medicare or medicaid programs  is liable for the refund of amounts received pursuant to prohibited claims  is subject to civil penalties of up to  per referral and can be excluded from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
hhs regulations to stark ii became effective in january  cms adopted phase ii of its regulations under stark ii in march  these regulations exclude from covered designated health services and referral prohibitions  services included in the esrd composite rate and epo and other drugs required as part of dialysis treatments under certain conditions 
also excluded from inpatient hospital services are dialysis services provided by a hospital not certified by cms to provide outpatient dialysis services  which would exclude our inpatient hospital services agreements from stark ii 
equipment and supplies used in connection with home dialysis are excluded from the stark ii definition of durable medical equipment 
stark ii regulations and the legislative history of stark ii indicates that the purpose behind the stark ii prohibition on physician referral is to prevent medicare and medicaid program and patient abuse 
since dialysis is a necessary medical treatment for those with temporary or permanent kidney failure  it is not highly susceptible to that type of abuse 
we believe  based upon the proposed rules and the industry practice  that congress did not intend to include dialysis services and the services and items we provide that are incidental to dialysis services within the stark ii prohibitions 
if the provisions of stark ii were found to apply to our arrangements however  we believe that we would be in compliance 
we compensate our nephrologist physicians  or practices with which they are affiliated  as medical directors of our dialysis centers pursuant to medical director agreements  which we believe meet the exception for personal service arrangements under stark ii 
non affiliated physicians who send their patients to or treat their patients at any of our facilities do not receive any compensation from the company 
medical directors of our dialysis centers who hold a minority investment interest in the subsidiaries operating those centers may refer patients to hospitals with which we have an acute inpatient dialysis service arrangement 
although the regulations of stark ii may be interpreted to apply to these types of transactions  we believe that our contractual arrangements with hospitals for acute care inpatient dialysis services are in compliance with stark ii 
if cms or any other government entity otherwise interprets the stark ii regulations  we may be required to restructure certain existing compensation or investment agreements with our medical directors  or  in the alternative  refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from certain physicians 
stark ii prohibits medicare or medicaid reimbursement of items or services provided pursuant to a prohibited referral  and imposes substantial civil monetary penalties on facilities which submit claims for reimbursement 
if such were to be the case  we could be required to repay amounts reimbursed for drugs  equipment and services that cms determines to have been furnished in violation of stark ii  in addition to substantial civil monetary penalties  which could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
we believe that if stark ii is interpreted by cms or any other governmental entity to apply to our arrangements  it is possible that we could be permitted to bring our financial relationships with referring physicians into material compliance with the provisions of stark ii on a prospective basis 
however  prospective compliance may not eliminate the amounts or penalties  if any  that might be determined to be owed for past conduct  and there can be no assurance that the costs and expenses associated with such prospective compliance  if permissible  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
health insurance reform act the health insurance portability and accountability act of  known as hipaa  provided for health insurance reforms which included a variety of provisions important to healthcare providers  such as significant changes to the medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse laws  which were expanded 
hipaa established two programs that coordinate federal  state and local healthcare fraud and abuse activities 
under these programs  these governmental entities undertake a variety of monitoring activities  including medical utilization and fraud review  cost report audits and secondary payor determinations 
the incentive program for fraud and abuse information rewards medicare recipients of the overpayment up to  for reporting medicare fraud and abuse 
hipaa further created health care fraud crimes and extended their applicability to private health plans 
as part of the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa  final regulations governing electronic transactions relating to healthcare information were published by hhs 
these regulations require a party transmitting or receiving healthcare transactions electronically to send and receive data in single format 
this regulation applies to our submissions and processing of healthcare claims and also applies to many of our payors 
we believe that we are in compliance with the transactions standards rule 
hipaa also includes provisions relating to the privacy of healthcare information 
hhs privacy rules cover all individually identifiable healthcare information known as protected health information and apply to healthcare providers  health plans  and healthcare clearing houses  known as covered entities 
the regulations are quite extensive and complex  but basically require companies to i obtain patient acknowledgement of receipt of a notice of privacy practices  ii obtain patient authorization before certain uses and disclosures of protected health information  iii respond to patient requests for access to their healthcare information  and iv develop policies and procedures with respect to uses and disclosures of protected health information 
we expended significant resources to develop and implement policies and procedures to address privacy issues  and we believe we are in compliance with the hipaa privacy rules 
the final hipaa security regulations governing the security of health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically were published in february  these regulations generally require implementation of safeguards for ensuring the confidentiality of electronic health information 
most covered entities will have until april  to comply with the standards 
management believes it is currently in compliance with the hipaa security standards 
hipaa increases significantly the civil and criminal penalties for offenses related to healthcare fraud and abuse 
hipaa increased civil monetary penalties from  plus twice the amount for each false claim to  plus three times the amount for each false claim 
hipaa expressly prohibits four practices  namely submitting a claim that the person knows or has reason to know is for medical items or services that are not medically necessary  transferring remuneration to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries that is likely to influence such beneficiary to order or receive items or services  certifying the need for home health services knowing that all of the coverage requirements have not been met  and engaging in a pattern or practice of upcoding claims in order to obtain greater reimbursement 
however  hipaa creates a tougher burden of proof for the government by requiring that the government establish that the person knew or should have known a false or fraudulent claim was presented 
the knew or should have known standard is defined to require deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information  thus merely negligent conduct or billing errors should not violate the civil false claims act 
as for criminal penalties  hipaa adds healthcare fraud  theft  embezzlement  obstruction of investigations and false statements to the general federal criminal code with respect to federally funded health programs  thus subjecting such acts to criminal penalties 
persons convicted of these crimes face up to years imprisonment and or fines 
moreover  a court imposing a sentence on a person convicted of federal healthcare offense may order the person to forfeit all real or personal property that is derived from the criminal offense 
the attorney general is also provided with a greatly expanded subpoena power under hipaa to investigate fraudulent criminal activities  and federal prosecutors may utilize asset freezes  injunctive relief and forfeiture of proceeds to limit fraud during such an investigation 
although we believe we substantially comply with currently applicable state and federal laws and regulations and to date have not had any difficulty in maintaining our licenses and medicare and medicaid authorizations  the healthcare service industry is and will continue to be subject to substantial and continually changing regulation at the federal and state levels  and the scope and effect of such and its impact on our operations cannot be predicted 
no assurance can be given that our activities will not be reviewed or challenged by regulatory authorities 
we continue to work with our healthcare counsel in reviewing our policies and procedures and make every effort to comply with hipaa and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
any loss by us of our approval as a certified provider under the medicare or medicaid programs or our licenses under the laws of any state or other governmental authority from which a substantial portion of our revenues are derived or a change resulting from healthcare reform  a reduction of dialysis reimbursement or a reduction or complete elimination of coverage for dialysis services  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
environmental and health regulations our dialysis centers are subject to various federal  state and local hazardous waste laws and non hazardous medical waste disposal laws 
most of our waste is non hazardous 
we also follow osha s hazardous waste communications policy  which requires all employees to be knowledgeable of the presence of and familiar with the use and disposal of hazardous chemicals in the facility 
medical waste of each facility is handled by licensed local medical waste sanitation agencies who are primarily responsible for compliance with such laws 
there are a variety of regulations promulgated under osha relating to employees exposed to blood and other potentially infectious materials requiring employers  including dialysis centers  to provide protection 
we adhere to osha s protective guidelines  including regularly testing employees and patients for exposure to hepatitis b and providing employees subject to such exposure with hepatitis b vaccinations on an as needed basis  protective equipment  a written exposure control plan and training in infection control and waste disposal 
other regulation there are also federal and state laws  such as the federal false claims act  prohibiting anyone from presenting false claims or fraudulent information to obtain payments from medicare  medicaid and other third party payors 
these laws provide for both criminal and civil penalties  exclusion from medicare and medicaid participation  repayment of previously collected amounts and other financial penalties 
the submission of medicare cost reports and requests for payment by dialysis centers are covered by these laws 
the false claims act has been used to prosecute for fraud  for coding errors  billing for services not provided  and billing for services at a higher than allowable billing rate 
we believe we have the proper internal controls and procedures for issuance of accounts and complete cost reports and payment requests 
such reports and requests  however  are subject to a challenge under these laws 
certain states have anti kickback legislation and laws dealing with self referral provisions similar to the federal anti kickback statute and stark ii 
we have no reason to believe that we are not in compliance with such state laws 
dialysis corporation of america has developed a compliance program as part of its corporate integrity program  designed to assure compliance with fraud and abuse laws and regulations 
see above under the caption corporate integrity program 
the establishment and implementation of our compliance program  coupled with our existing policies and internal controls  could have the effect of mitigating any civil or criminal penalties for potential violations  of which we have had none since our inception in we will continue to use our best efforts to fully comply with federal and state laws  regulations and requirements as applicable to our operations and business 
competition the dialysis industry is highly competitive 
there are numerous providers who have dialysis centers in the same areas as our centers 
many are owned by larger corporations  which operate dialysis centers regionally  nationally and internationally 
our operations are small in comparison with those corporations 
some of our major competitors are public companies  including fresenius medical care  inc  gambro healthcare  inc  davita  inc and renal care group  inc 
davita recently entered into an agreement to acquire gambro 
these companies have substantially greater financial resources  significantly more centers  patients and services than we do  and by virtue of such may have an advantage over us in competing for nephrologists and acquisitions of dialysis facilities in areas and markets we target 
moreover  competition for acquisitions has increased the cost of acquiring existing dialysis centers 
fresenius and gambro also manufacture and sell dialysis equipment and supplies  which may provide them with a greater competitive edge 
we also face competition from hospitals and physicians that operate their own dialysis facilities 
competitive factors most important in dialysis treatment are quality of care and service  convenience of location and pleasantness of the environment 
another significant competitive factor is the ability to attract and retain qualified nephrologists 
these physicians are a substantial source of patients for the dialysis centers  are required as medical directors of the dialysis center for it to participate in the medicare esrd program  and are responsible for the supervision of the medical operations of the center 
our medical directors usually are subject to non compete restrictions within a limited geographic area from the center they administer 
additionally  there is always substantial competition for obtaining qualified  competent nurses and technical staff at reasonable labor costs 
there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively with any of our competitors 
based upon advances in surgical techniques  immune suppression and computerized tissue typing  cross matching of donor cells and donor organ availability  renal transplantation in lieu of dialysis is a competitive factor 
it is presently the second most commonly used modality in esrd therapy 
with greater availability of kidney donations  currently the most limiting factor in the growth of this modality  renal transplantations could become a more significant competitive aspect to the dialysis treatments we provide 
although kidney transplant is a preferred treatment for esrd  certain patients who have undergone such transplants have subsequently lost the functionality of the transplanted kidney and have returned to dialysis treatments 
employees as of february   our company had full time employees  including administrators  licensed practical nurses  registered nurses  technical specialists  patient care technicians  clerical employees  social workers  dietitians and corporate staff 
we retain part time employees consisting of registered nurses  patient care technicians and clerical employees 
we also utilize per diem personnel to supplement staffing 
we retain independent contractors and sub contractors who include social workers and dietitians at our maryland  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia and certain georgia facilities 
these contractors are in addition to the medical directors  who supervise patient treatment at each facility 
we believe our relationship with our employees is excellent and we have not suffered any strikes or work stoppages 
none of our employees is represented by any labor union 
we are an equal opportunity employer 
risk factors we have listed below certain of the risk factors relating to dialysis corporation of america and our securities 
there may be other risks and uncertainties that we may face and of which we are currently unaware which could also adversely affect our business  operations and financial condition 
if any of such risks or uncertainties arise  or the risks listed below occur  our operations  earnings and financial condition could be materially harmed  which  in turn  would most likely adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
any such event could negatively impact a shareholder s investment in the company 
until fiscal  we had experienced operational losses since  when we sold four of our five dialysis centers  we had experienced operational losses 
not until fiscal did we reflect net income 
we initiated an expansion program in  opening two new dialysis centers that year  and to date operate and or manage centers in the states of georgia  maryland  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia and south carolina  and we have five centers in development 
some of our dialysis centers have generated losses since their commencement of operations and  although typical to newly established facilities  some continue to generate losses after months of operations 
this is due to operational costs and time needed to reach maturity of dialysis treatments 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dialysis operations are subject to extensive government regulation our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal and state government regulations  which include licensing requirements for each dialysis center government healthcare program participation requirements reimbursement for patient services patient referral prohibitions  broad federal and state anti kickback regulations false claims prohibitions for health care reimbursement and other fraud and abuse regulations record keeping requirements health  safety and environmental compliance expanded protection of the privacy and security of personal medical data establishing standards for the exchange of electronic health information  electronic transactions and code sets  unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals many of these laws and regulations are complex and open to further judicial and legislative interpretations 
if we are forced to change our method of operations because of these regulations  our earnings  financial condition and business could be adversely affected 
the imposition of additional licensing and other regulatory requirements may  among other things  increase our cost of doing business 
in addition  any violation of these governmental regulations could involve substantial civil and criminal penalties and fines  revocation of our licenses  closure of one or more of our centers  and our exclusion from participating in medicare and medicaid programs 
any loss of federal or state certifications or licenses would materially adversely impact our business 
our arrangements with our physician medical directors do not meet the safe harbor provisions of federal and state laws  and may subject us to greater governmental scrutiny neither our arrangements with the medical directors of our facilities  typically retained by us as independent contractors under a fixed fee medical director agreement  nor the minority ownership interests of referring physicians in certain of our dialysis facilities meet all of the requirements of published safe harbors to the illegal remuneration provisions of the social security act and similar state laws 
these laws impose civil and criminal sanctions on persons who receive or make payments for referring a patient for treatment that is paid for in whole or in part by medicare  medicaid or similar state programs 
transactions that do not fall within the safe harbor may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies 
our operations are subject to medicare and medicaid audits with concurrent potential civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply we are subject to periodic audits by the medicare and medicaid programs  which have various rights and remedies if they assert that we have overcharged the programs or failed to comply with program requirements 
rights and remedies available under these programs include repayment of any amounts alleged to be overpayments or in violation of program requirements  or making deductions from future amounts due to us 
these programs may also impose fines  criminal penalties or program exclusions 
in the ordinary course of our business  we receive notices of deficiencies for failure to comply with various regulatory requirements 
we review such notices and take appropriate corrective action 
in most cases  we and the reviewing agency will agree upon the measures that will bring the center or services into compliance 
in some cases or upon repeat violations  none of which we have experienced  the reviewing agency may take various adverse actions against a provider  including but not limited to the imposition of fines  suspension of payments for new admissions to the center  and in extreme circumstances  decertification from participation in the medicare or medicaid programs and revocation of a center s license 
any such regulatory actions could adversely affect a center s ability to continue to operate  to provide certain services  and or its eligibility to participate in medicare or medicaid programs or to receive payments from other payors 
moreover  regulatory actions against one center may subject our other centers  which may be deemed under our common control or ownership  to similar adverse remedies 
there has been increased governmental focus and enforcement with respect to anti fraud initiatives as they relate to healthcare providers state and federal governments are devoting increased attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers 
legislation has expanded the penalties for heath care fraud  including broader provisions for the exclusion of providers from the medicaid program 
we have established policies and procedures that we believe are sufficient to ensure that our facilities will operate in substantial compliance with these anti fraud requirements 
while we believe that our business practices are consistent with medicare and medicaid criteria  those criteria are often vague and subject to change and interpretation 
anti fraud actions could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our revenues and financial stability are dependent on fixed reimbursement rates under medicare and medicaid during  and  approximately  and of our patient revenues was derived from medicare reimbursement and  and of our patient revenues was derived from medicaid and equivalent programs 
decreases in medicare and medicaid and equivalent rates and programs for our dialysis treatments would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
federal and state governments seek to maintain  if not reduce costs  and any such actions in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our revenues and earnings  including the following reductions in payments to us or government programs in which we participate increases in labor and supply costs  which we do experience  without comparable governmental reimbursement rate increases inclusion in the flat composite rate for dialysis treatments those ancillary services which we currently bill separately this year the reimbursement rate will change  primarily increasing the composite rate by and reducing the reimbursement rate for certain drugs  including epo 
cms is expanding the drug and ancillary services that are included in the composite rate 
we will be reimbursed for other separately billable esrd drugs at an average sale price plus the regulations provide for budget neutrality  case mix and geographic adjustments in the composite rate 
management does not believe these changes in reimbursement coupled with a increase in the medicare composite rate will have a significant impact on our operations  expenses or earnings 
decreases in reimbursement payments from third party  non government payors could adversely affect our earnings any reduction in the rates paid by private insurers  hospitals and other non governmental third party organizations would adversely affect our business 
alternatively  any change in patient coverage  such as medicare eligibility as opposed to higher private insurance coverage  would result in a reduction of revenue 
we estimate approximately  and of our patient revenues for  and  respectively  was obtained from sources other than medicare or medicaid and equivalent programs 
we generally charge non governmental organizations for dialysis treatment rates which exceed the fixed medicare and medicaid and equivalent rates 
any limitation on our ability to charge these higher rates  which may be affected by expanded coverage by medicare under the fixed composite rate  or expanded coverage of dialysis treatments by managed care organizations  which commonly have lower rates than we charge  could adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
any decrease in the availability of or the reimbursement rate of epo would reduce our revenues and earnings epo  the bio engineered drug used for treating anemia in dialysis patients  is currently available from a single manufacturer  amgen  inc in  amgen increased the price of epo  and there is no assurance that there will not be further price increases 
there currently is no alternative drug available to us for the treatment of anemia of our dialysis patients 
the available supply of epo could be delayed or reduced  whether by amgen itself  through unforeseen circumstances  or as a result of excessive demand 
this would adversely impact our revenues and profitability  since approximately  and  respectively  of our medical revenues in  and were based upon the administration of epo to our dialysis patients 
most of our epo reimbursement is from government programs 
the implementation of the case mix adjustment could adversely affect our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
cms has adopted a case mix adjustment for the esrd composite rate  under which the medicare composite rate will be adjusted based on a patient s age  body mass index and body surface are 
these regulations are scheduled to become effective in april  management believes implementing these case mix adjustments will require significant systems changes for the medicare fiscal intermediaries that process and pay medicare claims 
if the required systems changes are not made on a timely basis  then the medicare fiscal intermediaries may delay the payment of claims or may not pay claims correctly  either of which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow  revenues and profitability 
we are presently unable to predict the impact of this care mix adjustment  since it depends on our patient mix 
new amgen drug could affect use of epo  adversely impacting our profitability 
amgen is the sole manufacturer of epo  which is administered in conjunction with dialysis treatments to address a patient s anemia 
amgen has developed and obtained fda approval for its new drug aranesp  used to treat anemia  and which is indicated to be effective for a longer period than epo 
based on its longer lasting capabilities  potential profit margins on aranesp could be significantly lower than on epo  and furthermore  aranesp could be administered by a dialysis patient s physician  further eliminating potential revenues from the treatment of anemia in our dialysis patients 
the introduction of aranesp as an anemia treatment for dialysis patients  therefore  could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
our ability to grow is subject to our resources and available locations other than four center acquisitions over the period through  expansion of our operations has been through construction of dialysis centers 
we developed two dialysis centers and acquired one facility in and opened five new centers and acquired a company with two dialysis facilities in we seek areas with qualified and cost effective nursing and technical personnel and a sufficient population to sustain a dialysis center 
these opportunities are limited and we compete with much larger dialysis companies for appropriate locations 
the time period from the beginning of construction through commencement of operations of a dialysis center generally takes four to six months and sometimes longer 
once the center is operable  it generates revenues  but usually does not operate at full capacity  and may incur losses for approximately months or longer 
our growth strategy based on construction also involves the risks of our ability to identify suitable locations to develop additional centers 
those we do develop may never achieve profitability  and additional financing may not be available to finance future development 
our inability to acquire or develop dialysis centers in a cost effective manner would adversely affect our ability to expand our business and as a result  our profitability 
growth places significant demands on our financial and management skills 
inability on our behalf to meet the challenges of expansion and to manage any such growth would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our attempt to expand through development or acquisition of dialysis centers which are not currently identified entails risks which shareholders and investors will not have a basis to evaluate we expand generally by seeking an appropriate location for development of a dialysis center and by taking into consideration the potential geographic patient base  and the availability of a physician nephrologist to be our medical director and a skilled work force 
construction  equipment and initial working capital costs for a new dialysis center with stations  typically the size of our dialysis facilities  range from  to  the cost of acquiring a center is usually much greater 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing or acquiring dialysis facilities  or otherwise successfully expanding our operations 
we are negotiating with nephrologists and others to establish new dialysis centers  but we cannot assure you that these negotiations will result in the development of new centers 
furthermore  there is no basis for shareholders and investors to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any potential development or acquisition of dialysis facilities 
we depend on physician referrals  and the limitation or cessation of such referrals would adversely impact our revenues and earnings most dialysis facilities  including ours  are dependent upon referrals of esrd patients for treatment by physicians  primarily those physicians specializing in nephrology 
we retain by written agreement qualified physicians or groups of qualified physicians to serve as medical directors for each of our facilities 
the medical directors are typically a source of patients treated at the particular facility served 
there is no requirement for these physicians to refer their patients to us  and they are free to refer patients to any other dialysis facility 
the loss of the patient base of the medical director or other physicians in the area of our facilities could result in a decline in our operations  revenues and earnings 
we may not be able to renew or otherwise negotiate compensation under the medical director agreements with our medical director physicians which could terminate the relationship  and without a suitable medical director replacement could result in closure of the facility 
accordingly  the loss of these key physicians at a particular facility could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the facility and could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
most of our medical director agreements range in terms of from five to ten years with renewals 
we have had no difficulty in renewing the few agreements which expired in all the medical director agreements provide for noncompetition restrictions 
we have never had to attempt to enforce such restrictions  but there is no assurance that a particular jurisdiction in which the agreement is applicable would uphold such noncompetition agreement  which would increase the potential for competition with affiliated dialysis centers and could adversely impact our revenues and earnings 
some of our medical directors or the medical groups with whom they are associated own minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries which operate dialysis centers 
if these interests are deemed to violate applicable federal or state law  these physicians may be forced to dispose of their ownership interests 
industry changes could adversely affect our business healthcare organizations  public and private  continue to change the manner in which they operate and pay for services 
our business is designed to function within the current healthcare financing and reimbursement system 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of government regulation of reimbursement rates and capital expenditures  among other things 
in addition  proposals to reform the healthcare system have been considered by congress  and still remain a priority issue 
any new legislative initiatives  if enacted  may i further increase government regulation of or other involvement in healthcare  ii lower reimbursement rates  and iii otherwise change the operating environment for healthcare companies 
we cannot predict the likelihood of those events or what impact they may have on our earnings  financial condition or business 
our business is subject to substantial competition  and we must compete effectively  otherwise our growth could slow we are operating in a highly competitive environment in terms of operation  development and acquisition of existing dialysis centers 
our competition comes from other dialysis centers  many of which are owned by much larger companies  and from hospitals 
the dialysis industry is rapidly consolidating  resulting in several very large dialysis companies competing for the acquisition of existing dialysis centers and the development of relationships with referring physicians 
recently  davita  inc has proposed to acquire gambro healthcare us  which  if such transaction is completed  could result in that combined entity being one of the largest  if not the largest  dialysis provider in the united states 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources  more dialysis facilities and a significantly larger patient base 
in addition  technological advances by our competitors may provide more effective dialysis treatments than the services provided by our centers 
we also compete with physicians who open their own dialysis facilities 
competition for existing centers has increased the costs of acquiring such facilities 
competition is also intense for qualified nursing and technical staff as well as for nephrologists with an adequate patient base 
although we have exhibited growth over the last several years  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively 
our failure to do so could impair our continued growth and profitability 
we could be subject to professional liability claims that may adversely affect us operation of dialysis centers and  in particular  the provision of dialysis treatments to esrd patients  as is the case with most healthcare treatment services  entails significant risks of liability 
accordingly  we could be subject to various actions and claims of professional liability alleging negligence in the performance of our treatment and related services  as well as for the acts or omissions of our employees 
as we grow and the number of our patients increases  so too does our exposure increase to potential malpractice  professional negligence  and other related legal theories and causes of action 
these potential claims could seek substantial damages  possibly beyond our insurance coverage  and could subject us to the incurrence of significant fees and costs related to defending such potential claims 
such potential future claims for malpractice or professional liability  including any judgments  settlements or costs associated with such claims and actions  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our insurance costs and deductibles have been substantially increasing over the last several years  and may not be sufficient to cover claims and losses we maintain a program of insurance coverage against a broad range of risks in our business  including  and of primary importance  professional liability insurance  subject to certain deductibles 
the premiums and deductibles under our insurance program have been steadily and significantly increasing over the last several years as a result of general business rate increases coupled with our continued growth and development of dialysis centers 
we are unable to predict further increases in premiums and deductibles  but based on experience we anticipate further increases in this area  which could adversely impact earnings 
the liability exposure of operations in the healthcare services industry has increased  resulting not only in increased premiums  but in limited liability on behalf of the insurance carriers 
our ability to obtain the necessary and sufficient insurance coverage for our operations upon expiration of our insurance policies may be limited  and sufficient insurance may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
such insurance may not be sufficient to cover any judgments  settlements or costs relating to potential future claims  complaints or law suits 
our inability to obtain sufficient insurance for our operations  or if we obtain insurance which is limited  any future significant judgments  settlements and costs relating to future potential actions  suits or claims  could have an adverse effect on our company 
medicore  inc  our parent  which owns approximately of our voting securities  has some common officers and directors  which presents the potential for conflicts of interest medicore owns approximately of our common stock  and is able to elect all of our directors and otherwise control our management and operations 
such control is also complemented by the fact that thomas k 
langbein is chairman of the board of both our company and medicore  of which he is also the president and chief executive officer  and daniel r 
ouzts is vice president and treasurer of both companies 
neither mr 
langbein nor mr 
ouzts devotes full time to our management 
peter d 
fischbein  who has been a director of medicore since  was elected as a director of our company in june  lawrence e 
jaffe  esq  a member of jaffe falk  llc  our corporate counsel  is our corporate secretary  as well as corporate secretary and a director of medicore 
the costs of executive salaries and other shared corporate overhead for these companies are allocated on the basis of time spent 
the amount of expenses charged to us by medicore for amounted to approximately  additionally  there have been past and there are current transactions between our company and medicore and their directors  including insurance coverage 
in march   medicore agreed to provide us with up to  in dialysis equipment financing under a demand promissory note with individual advances with interest at prime plus 
the note was subsequently modified to increase the maximum advances to  and its purpose expanded to include working capital 
at march   there was  outstanding under this financing 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
since medicore holds a majority interest in our company  there exists the potential for conflicts between medicore and us  and the responsibilities of our management to our shareholders could conflict with the responsibilities owed by management of medicore to its shareholders 
the loss of certain executive personnel without retaining qualified replacements could adversely affect our business operations  and as a result  our revenues and earnings could decline we are dependent upon the services of our executive officers  thomas k 
langbein  chairman of the board  who also holds that position with our parent  medicore  of which company he is also president and chief executive officer  and stephen w 
everett  our president  chief executive officer and a director 
mr 
langbein has been involved with medicore since  when his investment banking firm  todd company  inc  took it public  and with us since we became a public company in originally a wholly owned subsidiary of medicore organized in 
mr 
everett joined our company in november  as vice president  became executive vice president in june   president on march   and chief executive officer in may  mr 
everett has been involved in the healthcare industry for years 
mr 
langbein has an employment agreement with our parent through february   which provides for a one year from termination non competition within miles of medicore s medical products operations or then existing dialysis facilities owned by our company  with no restrictions outside these limits 
mr 
everett has an employment agreement with us through december   with a one year non competition provision within the united states  which period is extended for the duration of any breach of the non competition provisions 
the covenant not to compete is inapplicable if we terminate mr 
everett without cause or we materially breach the agreement 
it would be very difficult to replace the services of these individuals  whose services  both individually and combined  if lost  would adversely affect our operations and earnings  and most likely as a result  the trading price of our common stock 
there is no key man life insurance covering any of our officers 
shares eligible for future sale by restricted shareholders may adversely affect our stock price our officers and directors and officers and directors of our parent own approximately  shares of our common stock and vested options exercisable into an additional approximately  shares of common stock  for an aggregate of  shares or approximately of the outstanding common stock 
most of the shares held by these officers and directors  upon satisfying the conditions of rule under the securities act  may be sold without complying with the registration provisions of the securities act

common stock of the company owned by our officers and directors and the officers and directors of our parent represent approximately of the float 
accordingly  the sale by such officers and directors under rule may have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stock  and may inhibit our ability to manage subsequent equity or debt financing 
over the last year and several months  our stock price has exhibited volatility  and any investment in our common stock may  therefore  decline for reasons unrelated to our performance our common stock trades on the nasdaq smallcap market under the symbol dcai

other than the merger announcement on march   and the continued growth of the company  there was no information known to management that would cause the rise or significant fluctuation in the price of our common stock  or the increase in trading volume 
the renal care industry has experienced continued and rapid consolidation  as evidenced by the proposed acquisition involving two of the major dialysis services providers  davita  inc and gambro healthcare us  for an estimated billion  and may have generated interest of the marketplace in our common stock 
other factors that could continue to cause fluctuation in our common stock include changes in government regulation  whether legislative  enforcement or reimbursement rates third party reports relating to the dialysis industry and our company unsolicited by management announcements by management relating to the company s performance or other material events actions and announcements by our competitors the outlook for the healthcare industry generally investors should understand that in general  stock prices fluctuate for reasons unrelated to operating results

overview dialysis corporation of america provides dialysis services  primarily kidney dialysis treatments through outpatient dialysis centers  including a owned ohio affiliate and one unaffiliated dialysis center which it manages  to patients with chronic kidney failure  also know as end stage renal disease or esrd 
we provide dialysis treatments to dialysis patients of nine hospitals and medical centers through acute inpatient dialysis services agreements with those entities 
we provide homecare services  including home peritoneal dialysis 
the following table shows the number of in center  home peritoneal and acute inpatient treatments performed by us through the dialysis centers we operate  including the two centers we manage  one in which we have a ownership interest  and those hospitals and medical centers with which we have inpatient acute service agreements for the periods presented year ended december  in center home peritoneal acute treatments by the two managed centers included in center treatments of   and  respectively  for  and  no home peritoneal treatments  and acute treatments of  and  respectively  for  and we also provide ancillary services associated with dialysis treatments  including the administration of epo for the treatment of anemia in our dialysis patients 
epo is currently available from only one manufacturer  and no alternative drug has been available to us for the treatment of anemia in our dialysis patients 
if our available supply of epo were reduced either by the manufacturer or due to excessive demand  our revenues and net income would be adversely affected 
the manufacturer of epo increased its price in early  and could implement further price increases which would adversely affect our net income 
this manufacturer has developed another anemia drug that could possibly substantially reduce our revenues and profit from the treatment of anemia in our patients 
esrd patients must either obtain a kidney transplant or obtain regular dialysis treatments for the rest of their lives 
due to a lack of suitable donors and the possibility of transplanted organ rejection  the most prevalent form of treatment for esrd patients is hemodialysis through a kidney dialysis machine 
hemodialysis patients usually receive three treatments each week with each treatment lasting between three and five hours on an outpatient basis 
although not as common as hemodialysis in an outpatient facility  home peritoneal dialysis is an available treatment option  representing the third most common type of esrd treatment after outpatient hemodialysis and kidney transplantation 
approximately of our medical service revenues are derived from medicare and medicaid reimbursement with rates established by cms  and which rates are subject to legislative changes 
over the last two years  medicare reimbursement rates have not increased 
congress has approved a composite rate increase for also for  medicare is implementing the way it reimburses dialysis providers  which includes revision of pricing for separately billable drugs and biologics  with an add on component to make the change budget neutral 
medicare also is to implement a case mix payment system as an adjustment to the composite rate 
see item  business operations medicare reimbursement 
dialysis is typically reimbursed at higher rates from private payors  such as a patient s insurance carrier  as well as higher payments received under negotiated contracts with hospitals for acute inpatient dialysis services 
the following table shows the breakdown of our revenues by type of payor for the periods presented year ended december  medicare medicaid and comparable programs hospital inpatient dialysis services commercial insurers and other private payors our medical service revenues are derived primarily from four sources outpatient hemodialysis services  home peritoneal dialysis services  inpatient hemodialysis services and ancillary services 
the following table shows the breakdown of our medical service revenues in thousands derived from our primary revenue sources and the percentage of total medical service revenue represented by each source for the periods presented year ended december  outpatient hemodialysis services home peritoneal dialysis services inpatient hemodialysis services ancillary services the healthcare industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal and state authorities 
there are a variety of fraud and abuse measures to combat waste  including anti kickback regulations and extensive prohibitions relating to self referrals  violations of which are punishable by criminal or civil penalties  including exclusion from medicare and other governmental programs 
unanticipated changes in healthcare programs or laws could require us to restructure our business practices which  in turn  could materially adversely affect our business  operations and financial condition 
see item  business government regulation 
we have developed a corporate integrity program to assure that we provide the highest level of patient care and services in a professional and ethical manner consistent with applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
among the different programs is our compliance program  which has been implemented to assure our compliance with fraud and abuse laws and to supplement our existing policies relating to claims submission  cost report preparation  initial audit and human resources  all geared towards a cost efficient operation beneficial to patients and shareholders 
see item  business corporate integrity program 
dialysis corporation of america s future growth depends primarily on the availability of suitable dialysis centers for development or acquisition in appropriate and acceptable areas  and our ability to manage the development costs for these potential dialysis centers while competing with larger companies  some of which are public companies or divisions of public companies with greater numbers of personnel and financial resources available for acquiring and or developing dialysis centers in areas targeted by us 
additionally  there is intense competition for qualified nephrologists who would serve as medical directors of dialysis facilities  and be responsible for the supervision of those dialysis centers 
there is no assurance as to when any new dialysis centers or inpatient service contracts with hospitals will be implemented  or the number of stations  or patient treatments such center or service contract may involve  or if such center or service contract will ultimately be profitable 
it has been our experience that newly established dialysis centers  although contributing to increased revenues  have adversely affected our results of operations in the short term due to start up costs and expenses and a smaller patient base 
results of operations the following table shows our results of operations in thousands and the percentage of medical service revenue represented by each line item for the periods presented year ended december  medical service revenue other income total operating revenues cost of medical services selling  general and administrative expenses provision for doubtful accounts total operating costs and expenses operating income other  net income before income taxes  minority interest and equity in affiliate earnings income tax provision income before minority interest and equity in affiliate earnings minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries equity in affiliate earnings net income compared to operating income increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
for this same period  income before income taxes  minority interest and equity in affiliate earnings increased   and net income increased  medical service revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year with the increase largely attributable to a increase in total dialysis treatments performed by the company from  in to  in this increase reflects increased revenues of approximately  for our pennsylvania dialysis centers  including revenues of  for our new pottstown center and revenues of  for the two centers included in our acquisition of keystone kidney care  increased revenues of  for our new jersey centers  increased revenues of  for our georgia centers  increased revenues of approximately  for our maryland centers  including revenues of  for our new rockville  maryland center  increased revenues of approximately  for our ohio center  revenues of approximately  for our two new virginia centers  and revenues of approximately  for our new south carolina center 
some of our patients carry commercial insurance which may require an out of pocket co pay by the patient  which is often uncollectible by us 
this co pay is typically limited  and therefore may lead to our under recognition of revenue at the time of service 
we routinely recognize these revenues as we become aware that these limits have been met 
other operating income increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this includes a litigation settlement of  during and an increase in management fee income of  pursuant to management services agreements with our owned toledo  ohio affiliate and an unaffiliated georgia center 
cost of medical services sales as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the preceding year  as a result of decreases in payroll costs and supply costs as a percentage of medical service sales 
approximately of our medical services revenues for the year ended december   and for the preceding year was derived from the administration of epo to our dialysis patients 
this drug is only available from one manufacturer in the united states 
price increases for this product without our ability to increase our charges would increase our costs and thereby adversely impact our earnings 
we cannot predict the timing  if any  or extent of any future price increases by the manufacturer  or our ability to offset any such increases 
beginning this year  medicare will reimburse dialysis providers for the top ten most utilized esrd drugs at an amount equal to the cost of such drugs as determined by the inspector general of hhs  with complimentary increases in the composite rate 
management believes these changes will have little impact on the company s average medicare revenue per treatment 
see item  business operations medicare reimbursement 
selling  general and administrative expenses  those corporate and facility costs not directly related to the care of patients  including  among others  administration  accounting and billing  increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this increase reflects operations of our new dialysis centers in pennsylvania  south carolina  virginia  and maryland  and increased support activities resulting from expanded operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of medical services revenues decreased to approximately for the ended december   compared to for the preceding year  including expenses of new centers incurred prior to medicare approval for which there were no corresponding medical service revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses include bonuses for officers  directors and corporate counsel amounting to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the preceding year 
see item  executive compensation 
provision for doubtful accounts increased approximately  for year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
medicare bad debt recoveries of  were recorded during the year ended december   compared to approximately  for the preceding year 
without the effect of the medicare bad debt recoveries  the provision would have amounted to of sales for the year ended december  compared to for the preceding year 
the provision for doubtful accounts reflects our collection experience with the impact of that experience included in accounts receivable presently reserved  plus recovery of accounts previously considered uncollectible from our medicare cost report filings 
the provision for doubtful accounts is determined under a variety of criteria  primarily aging of the receivables and payor mix 
accounts receivable are estimated to be uncollectible based upon various criteria including the age of the receivable  historical collection trends and our understanding of the nature and collectibility of the receivables  and are reserved for in the allowance for doubtful accounts until they are written off 
other non operating income expense decreased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this includes a decrease in interest income of  an increase in rental income of  a decrease in miscellaneous other income of  and a decrease in interest expense of  with the effect of reduced average non inter company borrowings more than offsetting an increase in average interest rates 
interest expense to our parent  medicore  inc  increased  for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year as a result of an increase in the intercompany advance payable to our parent and borrowings under a demand promissory note payable to our parent 
the prime rate was at december   and at december  see notes  and of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
although operations of additional centers have resulted in additional revenues  certain of these centers are still in the developmental stage and  accordingly  their operating results will adversely impact our overall results of operations until they achieve a patient count sufficient to sustain profitable operations 
we experienced same center growth in total treatments of approximately for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  and same center revenues grew approximately 
management continues to search for ways to operate more efficiently and reduce costs through process improvements 
in addition  we are reviewing technological improvements and intend to make capital investments to the extent we are confident such improvements will improve patient care and operating performance 

how much what kind cannot keep saying this explain 
minority interest represents the proportionate equity interests of minority owners of our subsidiaries whose financial results are included in our consolidated results 
equity in affiliate earnings represents our proportionate interest in the earnings of our owned ohio affiliate whose operating results improved for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements 
compared to medical service revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year with the increase largely attributable to a increase in total dialysis treatments performed by us from  in to  in this increase reflects increased revenues of approximately  for our pennsylvania dialysis centers  decreased revenues of  for our new jersey centers reflecting termination of our two new jersey acute care contracts during  increased revenues of  for our georgia centers  revenues of approximately  for our new maryland center  revenues of approximately  for our new ohio center  and a decrease in consulting and license income of approximately  other operating income increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this increase represents increased management fee income pursuant to management services agreements with our owned toledo  ohio affiliate and unaffiliated georgia center with which we entered a management services agreement effective september cost of medical services sales as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the preceding year which increase is primarily attributable to costs for treatments at new dialysis centers prior to medicare approval of those centers for which there were no corresponding medical service revenues  increases in the cost of epo as a percentage of epo sales revenues  and increases in the cost of professional liability insurance 
the cost of our professional liability insurance coverage increased by  or for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
while a portion of this increase is attributable to our new centers and overall increase in treatments  a substantial portion of the cost increase relates to the general market conditions for professional liability coverage of reduced availability and higher costs for this coverage 
continued cost increases for professional liability coverage could adversely impact our earnings 
approximately of our medical services revenues for the year ended december  was derived from the administration of epo to our dialysis patients compared to for the preceding year 
this drug is only available from one manufacturer in the united states which raised the price for its product in january  continued price increases for this product without our ability to increase our charges would increase our costs and thereby adversely impact our earnings

selling  general and administrative expenses  those corporate and facility costs not directly related to the care of patients  including  among others  administration  accounting and billing  increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this increase reflects operations of our new dialysis centers in ohio and maryland  and increased support activities resulting from expanded operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of medical services revenues increased to approximately for the year ended december   compared to for the preceding year  including patient treatment expenses of new centers incurred prior to medicare approval for which there were no corresponding medical service revenues 
provision for doubtful accounts decreased approximately  largely as a result of medicare bad debt recoveries of approximately  during compared to approximately  for the preceding year 
without the effect of the medicare bad debt recoveries the provision would have amounted to of sales for the year ended december  compared to for the preceding year 
this change reflects our collection experience with the impact of that experience included in accounts receivable presently reserved  plus recovery of accounts previously considered uncollectible from our medicare cost report filings 
the provision for doubtful accounts is determined under a variety of criteria  primarily aging of the receivables and payor mix 
accounts receivable are estimated to be uncollectible based upon various criteria including the age of the receivable  historical collection trends and our understanding of the nature and collectibility of the receivables  and are reserved for in the allowance for doubtful accounts until they are written off 
other non operating income expense increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this includes an increase in interest income of  an increase in rental income of  an increase in miscellaneous other income of  and a decrease in interest expense of  reflecting reduced average interest rates and reduced average non inter company borrowings during the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
the prime rate was at december  and at december  see notes  and of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
although operations of additional centers have resulted in additional revenues  certain of these centers are still in the developmental stage and  accordingly  their operating results adversely impact our overall results of operations until they achieve a patient count sufficient to sustain profitable operations 
we experienced same center growth in total treatments of approximately in  and same center revenues grew approximately in fiscal management continues to search for ways to operate more efficiently and reduce costs through process improvements 
in addition  we are reviewing technological improvements and intend to make capital investments to the extent we are confident such improvements will improve patient care and operating performance 
interest expense decreased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  reflecting lower interest rates on variable rate debt and reduced average borrowings by us

capital is needed primarily for the development of outpatient dialysis centers 
the construction of a station facility  typically the size of our dialysis facilities  costs in the range of  to  depending on location  size and related services to be provided  which includes equipment and initial working capital requirements 
acquisition of an existing dialysis facility is more expensive than construction  although acquisition would provide us with an immediate ongoing operation  which most likely would be generating income 
although our expansion strategy focuses primarily on construction of new centers  we have expanded through acquisition of dialysis facilities and continue to review potential acquisitions 
development of a dialysis facility to initiate operations takes four to six months and usually up to months or longer to generate income 
we consider some of our centers to be in the developmental stage since they have not developed a patient base sufficient to generate and sustain earnings 
we are seeking to expand our outpatient dialysis treatment facilities and inpatient dialysis care and are presently in different phases of negotiations with physicians for the development of additional outpatient centers 
such expansion requires capital 
we have been funding our expansion through internally generated cash flow and financing from our parent  medicore  inc see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements 
our future expansion may require us to seek outside financing 
while we anticipate that financing will be available either from a financial institution or our parent company  including the proposed merger of our parent with our company providing us with cash of at least approximately million to million see item  business recent developments  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy or that adequate financing will be available to support our expansion

critical accounting policies and estimates the sec has issued cautionary advice to elicit more precise disclosure in this item  md a  about accounting policies management believes are most critical in portraying our financial results and in requiring management s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments and estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and determining the recoverability of our long lived assets 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized net of contractual provisions at the expected collectable amount 
we receive payments through reimbursement from medicare and medicaid for our outpatient dialysis treatments coupled with patients private payments  individually and through private third party insurers 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from the medicare ersd program  which outpatient reimbursement rates are fixed under a composite rate structure  which includes the dialysis services and certain supplies  drugs and laboratory tests 
certain of these ancillary services are reimbursable outside of the composite rate 
medicaid reimbursement is similar and supplemental to the medicare program 
our acute inpatient dialysis operations are paid under contractual arrangements  usually at higher contractually established rates  as are certain of the private pay insurers for outpatient dialysis 
we have developed a sophisticated information and computerized coding system  but due to the complexity of the payor mix and regulations  we sometimes receive more or less than the amount expected when the services are provided 
we reconcile any differences at least quarterly 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our patients or their insurance carriers to make required payments 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
changes in general economic  business and market conditions could result in an impairment in the ability of our patients and the insurance companies to make their required payments  which would have an adverse effect on cash flows and our results of operations 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated based on actual collection experience 
we use a combination of percentage of sales and the aging of accounts receivable to establish an allowance for losses on accounts receivable 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the carrying value of deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which could result in additional income tax expense 
long lived assets we state our property and equipment at acquisition cost and compute depreciation for book purposes by the straight line method over estimated useful lives of the assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
these computations are complex and subjective 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this impairment test requires the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas effective january   and are required to analyze goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis 
impact of inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our operations 
a substantial portion of our revenue is subject to reimbursement rates established and regulated by the federal government 
these rates do not automatically adjust for inflation 
any rate adjustments relate to legislation and executive and congressional budget demands  and have little to do with the actual cost of doing business 
therefore  dialysis services revenues cannot be voluntarily increased to keep pace with increases in nursing and other patient care costs 
increased operating costs without a corresponding increase in reimbursement rates may adversely affect our earnings in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not consider our exposure to market risks  principally changes in interest rates  to be significant 
sensitivity of results of operations to interest rate risks on our investments is managed by conservatively investing funds in liquid interest bearing accounts of which we held approximately  at december  interest rate risk on debt is managed by negotiation of appropriate rates for equipment financing and other fixed rate obligations based on current market rates 
there is an interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt obligations  which totaled approximately  at december   and our demand promissory note payable to our parent  medicore  which amounted to approximately  at december  and  at march  we have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
assuming a relative decrease in rates on our period end investments in interest bearing accounts and a relative increase in rates on our period end variable rate debt would have resulted in a negative impact of approximately  on our results of operations for the year ended december  we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently use interest rate derivatives
