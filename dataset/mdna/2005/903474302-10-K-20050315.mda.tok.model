item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors including  but not limited to  those under item business risk factors 
restatements of prior years financial statements we reviewed our accounting practices with respect to lease transactions 
as a result of this review and in consultation with the audit committee of our board of directors  we determined that it was appropriate to restate our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  through december  and the nine months ended september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for restated quarterly financial data 
historically  when accounting for tower leases with renewal options  we recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the initial non cancelable lease term  excluding any potential renewal periods 
the restatements recognized rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  as amended of our tower leases 
cell site assets associated with such leased towers are depreciated over the shorter of the assets useful lives or the lease term 
these restatements resulted from the correction of accounting errors and were not attributable to any material non compliance by us with any financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws 
as a result of these restatements  certain previously reported amounts in our consolidated statements of operations have been restated as follows in thousands  except per share data year ended december  as originally reported adjustments as restated cost of services and operations   total costs and expenses   operating loss   loss before income taxes   net loss   basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock year ended december  as originally reported adjustments as restated cost of services and operations   total costs and expenses   operating loss   loss before income taxes   net loss   basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock the cumulative impact of the adjustments for all years prior to the year ended december  was approximately  and was recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit in stockholders equity as of december  the amounts reflected in cost of service and operations  as originally reported  included sprint pcs management fee expense reclassified from general and administrative expenses totaling million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
use of certain terms in  we initiated a reseller program under which mobile virtual network operators mvnos use our network and resell wireless service under a private label 
minutes and kilobytes are sold at wholesale rates 
virgin mobile usa launched reseller service in the second quarter of qwest communications launched reseller service in the second quarter of as of december   we had approximately  reseller subscribers 
in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item business  unless the context indicates otherwise  all references to subscribers or customers and other operating metrics mean subscribers or customers excluding reseller subscribers 
overview in october  ubiquitel llc entered into a management agreement with sprint pcs for the exclusive rights to market sprint s digital  pcs products and services to the residents in the reno tahoe  nevada market 
ubiquitel llc had no financial transactions from its inception august  to september  on september   ubiquitel inc formerly  ubiquitel holdings  inc 
was incorporated in delaware 
in november  ubiquitel llc assigned all of its material contracts including the rights to the sprint pcs agreements to ubiquitel inc on november   ubiquitel operating company operating company was formed to serve as the operating company for ubiquitel inc also  on march   ubiquitel leasing company was formed to serve as the leasing company for ubiquitel inc ubiquitel inc 
assigned the sprint pcs agreements to operating company following its formation 
on december   we amended our management agreement with sprint pcs to expand our markets to include northern california  spokane montana  southern idaho utah nevada and southern indiana kentucky  which together with reno tahoe  contain approximately million residents 
on february   in connection with our acquisition of via wireless llc  we amended our management agreement with sprint pcs to expand our markets effective at the closing in august to include million additional residents from the six via wireless basic trading areas covering the central valley of california market 
on august   upon the closing of the merger agreement  via wireless became a wholly owned subsidiary of operating company and was later merged into operating company in june on july   we amended our management agreement with sprint pcs to eliminate the obligation to build out the state of montana  thereby reducing our licensed resident population in our markets to approximately million 
as of december   we had approximately  subscribers excluding resellers and approximately  reseller subscribers  for a total subscriber base of approximately  as of december   our network covered approximately million residents which represented approximately of the licensed population in our markets 
as a pcs affiliate of sprint  we do not own the licenses to operate our network and instead pay sprint pcs for the use of its licenses 
under our management agreement with sprint pcs  sprint is entitled to receive of billed revenue from sprint pcs subscribers based in our markets less current period bad debts  net of bad debt recoveries  from sprint pcs subscribers based in our markets and fees from wireless service providers other than sprint pcs when their subscribers roam into our network 
we are entitled to of revenues collected from the sale of handsets and accessories from our stores and on roaming revenues received when sprint pcs customers from a different territory make a wireless call on our pcs network and outbound non sprint pcs roaming billed to subscribers based in our markets 
we are responsible for building  owning and managing the portion of the pcs network located in our markets under the sprint brand name 
our results of operations are dependent on sprint pcs network and  to a lesser extent  on the networks of other pcs affiliates of sprint 
as a pcs affiliate of sprint  we purchase a full suite of support services from sprint pcs including billing  customer care  collections and national platform services 
we pay a monthly per subscriber rate for these services which is reset every three years 
the current period for the service rates ends december  we have access to these services during the term of our management agreement unless sprint pcs provides us at least nine months advance notice of its intention to terminate any particular significant service 
if sprint pcs terminates service  our operations may be interrupted or restricted 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to long lived assets  goodwill  lease transactions  property and equipment  bad debt  inventory valuation  income taxes  deferred revenue and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
some of the most critical accounting policies  including those that require a significant amount of estimation or judgment in their application  include revenue recognition we recognize revenues when services have been rendered or products have been delivered  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we account for rebates  discounts and other sales incentives as a reduction to revenue 
subscriber revenue consists of monthly recurring service charges for voice and third generation data g data services and monthly non recurring charges for local  long distance  travel and roaming airtime usage and g data usage in excess of the pre subscribed usage plan received from our subscribers  cancellation and late fee revenues and surcharges  less reductions for billing adjustments and credits 
equipment revenue includes sales of handsets and accessories 
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from our subscribers as they use the service 
we pro rate access revenue over the billing period and record airtime usage in excess of the pre subscribed usage plan 
our subscribers pay an activation fee to us when they initiate service 
prior to the adoption of eitf on july   we deferred all activation fee revenue and direct customer activation costs on a straight line basis over the average life of our subscribers  which was estimated to be months 
direct customer activation costs in excess of activation fee revenue were recognized immediately 
we have determined that the sale of wireless services through our direct sales channels with an accompanying handset constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables as defined in eitf upon adoption of eitf  non refundable  up front activation fees billed in our direct sales channel are now included in equipment revenue rather than subscriber revenue in the consolidated statement of operations to the extent that the aggregate activation fee and handset proceeds received from a subscriber do not exceed the fair value of the handset sold 
as the total fair value of the handsets sold in direct sales channels consistently exceeds the aggregate activation fees and handset proceeds received from our subscribers  our adoption of eitf has resulted in our no longer deferring activation fees and  therefore  no longer deferring incremental direct activation costs for direct sales channel revenue arrangements 
approximately million and million of activation fees were included in equipment revenue during the years ended december  and  respectively 
roaming and wholesale revenue includes reseller revenue  sprint pcs travel revenue and non sprint pcs roaming revenue 
we record sprint pcs travel revenue on a per minute rate for voice services and on a per kilobit rate for data services when sprint pcs subscribers based outside our markets use our network 
we record non sprint pcs roaming revenue when non sprint pcs subscribers use our network 
we record reseller revenue when reseller subscribers use our network 
equipment revenue consists of proceeds from sales of handsets and accessories which are recorded at the time of sale 
revenues from sales of handsets and accessories represent a separate earnings process from service revenues because sales of handsets and accessories do not require customers to subscribe to wireless services 
beginning july  in accordance with eitf  equipment revenue also includes an allocation of the arrangement consideration from activation revenue received as part of revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we participate in the sprint national and regional distribution programs in which national retailers such as radioshack  best buy and costco sell sprint pcs products and services 
in order to facilitate the sale of sprint pcs products and services  national retailers purchase wireless handsets from sprint for resale and receive compensation from sprint for sprint pcs products and services sold 
for industry competitive reasons  sprint subsidizes the price of these handsets by selling the handsets at a price below cost 
under our sprint pcs agreements  when a national retailer sells a handset purchased from sprint to a subscriber in our markets  we are obligated to reimburse sprint for the handset subsidy 
we do not receive any revenues from sales of handsets and accessories by national retailers 
for a new subscriber activation and a handset upgrade to an existing subscriber  we include these handset subsidy charges in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of accounts receivable and inventories reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debt and are based both on our historical collection experience  current trends and credit policy and on a percentage of our accounts receivables by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we look at historical write offs of our receivables 
we also look at current trends in the credit quality of our customer base and changes in the credit policies 
sub prime credit class customers are required to make a deposit ranging from to that can be credited against future billings 
under sprint pcs service plans  sub prime credit class customers also are subject to account spending limits  ranging from to depending on the credit quality of the customer  to control credit exposure 
if our estimates of bad debt are insufficient for any reason  our operating income and available cash would be reduced 
reserve for obsolete excess inventory we record a reserve for obsolete or excess handset and accessories inventory for models and accessories that are no longer manufactured  for defective models and accessories that have been returned by customers 
if the estimate of obsolete inventory is understated  our operating income would be reduced 
long lived assets and goodwill statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed based on the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment loss  if indicated  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations be reviewed for recoverability  and that annual tests for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives be performed 
any write offs would result in a charge to earnings and a reduction in equity in the period taken 
as of october   we completed our annual impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
intangible assets consist of the unamortized cost of a sprint pcs management agreement acquired in a business combination 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life 
as of december   the remaining useful life of the acquired sprint pcs management agreement is years 
if there was a reduction in the useful life of this asset  our operating income would be reduced 
lease transactions we lease office space  retail stores  land for radio communications sites  leased space on radio communications sites and office equipment under operating leases 
our accounting for an operating lease transaction as of the lease s inception involves judgments in determining the number of lease renewal periods to be included in the lease term  in addition to the initial non cancelable term  used in recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis 
this judgment considers various factors that we would consider at the time of opting to renew such leases  particularly whether any nonrenewal could result in an economic detriment to us or the forgoing of an economic benefit available to us 
additionally  the lease term can impact the determination of the period over which depreciable assets associated with operating leases are depreciated 
if a lease with a lease term containing one or more renewal periods is not renewed after the initial term has expired  then the carrying values of the deferred rent liability resulting from straight line recognition of rent expense and any lease related assets reflected in the consolidated balance sheet would be written off and reflected in our results of operations in the period such nonrenewal occurred 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions of operation 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we then must assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
future taxable income depends on the ability to generate income in excess of allowable deductions 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations

sfas no 
r requires the recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements and measurement based on the grant date fair value of the award 
it also requires the cost to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and its related interpretations 
sfas no 
r is effective for periods beginning after june  and applies to all awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
additionally  compensation expense will be recognized over the remaining employee service period for the outstanding portion of any awards for which compensation expense had not been previously recognized or disclosed under sfas no 
we are currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting sfas no 
r  but expect that our adoption of this pronouncement will increase our stock based compensation expense in the period of adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 

sfas no 
amends apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges for nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
under sfas no 
 if a nonmonetary exchange of similar productive assets meets a commercial substance criterion and fair value is determinable  the transaction must be accounted for at fair value resulting in recognition of any gain or loss 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary transactions occurring in fiscal periods that begin after june  we do not anticipate that the implementation of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations we provide certain financial measures that are calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and adjustments to gaap non gaap to assess our financial performance 
in addition  we use certain non financial terms that are not measures of financial performance under gaap 
terms such as customer additions and churn are terms used in the wireless communications industry 
the non gaap financial measures of average revenue per user and cost per gross addition reflect standard measures of liquidity  profitability or performance 
the non financial terms and the non gaap measures reflect wireless communications industry conventions and are commonly used by the investment community for comparability purposes 
the non gaap measures included in this report are reconciled below in liquidity and capital resources reconciliation of non gaap financial measures 
analysis of the years ended december  and customer net additions as of december   we provided personal communications services to approximately  customers  an increase of approximately  from december  during  we added  net new subscribers 
churn churn is the monthly rate of customer turnover expressed as the percentage of customers of the beginning customer base that both voluntarily and involuntarily discontinued service during the period 
churn is computed by dividing the number of customers that discontinued service during the month  net of day returns  by the beginning customer base for the period 
churn for the year ended december  was approximately compared to approximately for the year ended december  the decrease in churn was primarily the result of the improvement in the credit quality of the overall customer base resulting in less service being discontinued involuntarily 
at december   the overall mix of our customer base was prime and sub prime 
at december   the overall mix of our customer base was prime and sub prime 
we expect involuntary churn to continue to decline with continued improvement in the quality of our customer base 
average revenue per user arpu average revenue per user arpu summarizes the average monthly subscriber revenue per customer 
arpu is computed by dividing subscriber revenue by the average subscribers for the period 
during the years ended december  and  our arpu was approximately we expect arpu to continue to decline marginally as billing for overage minutes continues to decrease 
this reduction is expected to be partially offset by the continued increase in data revenue 
cost per gross addition cpga cost per gross addition cpga summarizes the average cost to acquire new customers during the period 
cpga is computed by adding the income statement components of selling and marketing and the cost of products sold  and reducing that amount by the equipment revenue recorded 
the net result of these components is then divided by the gross customers acquired during the period 
cpga was approximately for the year ended december  compared to cpga of approximately for the year ended december  the increase in cpga was primarily due to higher handset upgrade costs of approximately per gross addition and the effect of increased handset promotion costs of approximately per gross addition 
we believe that cpga will remain at approximately current levels in the near term due to significant competition 
revenues subscriber revenue 
subscriber revenue during the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
subscriber revenue consists of monthly recurring service charges for voice and g data usage and monthly non recurring charges for local  long distance  travel and roaming airtime usage and g data usage in excess of the pre subscribed usage plan amount received from our subscribers  cancellation and late fee revenues and surcharges  less reductions for billing adjustments and billing corrections 
our customers charges are dependent on their rate plans  based on the number of minutes and g data usage included in their plans 
the increase in subscriber revenue was primarily attributable to the effect of the increase in our subscriber base 
roaming and wholesale revenue 
roaming and wholesale revenue consists of sprint pcs travel revenue  non sprint pcs roaming revenue and reseller revenue 
travel revenue is generated on a per minute rate for voice services or on a per kilobit rate for data services when a sprint pcs subscriber based outside our markets uses our network 
an additional long distance rate per minute is generated when that customer initiates a call from our network to call outside the local calling area 
non sprint pcs roaming revenue is generated when a non sprint pcs subscriber uses our network 
reseller revenue is generated when a reseller subscriber uses our pcs network 
during the second quarters of and  we initiated reseller programs with virgin mobile and qwest  respectively 
roaming and wholesale revenue during the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in roaming and wholesale revenue was due to increases in sprint pcs travel revenues for voice and data services of approximately million and million  respectively  and increases in non sprint roaming and reseller revenues of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increases in sprint pcs travel revenue and non sprint roaming revenue were primarily due to increases in travel and roaming minutes of use and g data usage 
our increase in reseller subscribers from approximately  as of december  to approximately  as of december  was the primary factor for our increase in reseller revenues 
we expect the growth rate for sprint pcs travel minutes and kilobytes in to slow compared to the rate of growth during we expect non sprint pcs roaming revenue to decline in the near term  primarily due to a decline in the roaming rate we receive from a significant roaming partner 
during  we expect reseller revenue to exceed amounts recognized in as a result of the significant increase in reseller subscribers during the second half of equipment revenue 
equipment revenue is generated from the sale of handsets and accessories and is recorded at the time of sale 
we record and retain of the revenue from the sale of handsets and accessories  net of rebates  discounts and other sales incentives  as equipment revenue 
the amounts recorded during the years ended december  and from equipment revenue totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the allocation of activation revenue to equipment revenue in accordance with eitf of approximately million 
cost of service and operations network operations expenses 
network operations expenses include radio communications site lease costs  utilities  network control maintenance  network control site leases  engineering personnel  transport facilities and interconnect charges  and totaled approximately million during the year ended december  compared to approximately million during the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we reclassified certain network operations expenses to sprint operating expenses totaling approximately million and million  respectively  to conform with current year presentation  due to the changes in costs resulting from the amendment to our sprint agreements in the increase was primarily due to the effect of an increase in interconnection charges of approximately million resulting from increased minutes of use and the effect of an increase in radio communications sites on backhaul and site lease expenses of approximately million 
travel and roaming expenses 
we pay sprint pcs travel fees on a per minute rate for voice services or on a per kilobit rate for data services when our customers use the sprint pcs network outside our markets and we incur additional long distance fees when our customers call long distance originating in a sprint pcs or pcs affiliate of sprint territory 
we also pay roaming fees to other wireless providers when our customers use their network 
travel and roaming expense totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in travel and roaming expenses was primarily due to increases in sprint pcs travel expenses for voice and data services of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in sprint pcs travel expense was due to increases in travel minutes of use and g data usage  primarily due to an approximate increase in our subscriber base 
bad debt expense 
bad debt expense during the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in bad debt expense was primarily attributable to the credit adjustment of approximately million due to the resolution of disputed charges with sprint pcs and a million reduction in operating expenses related to the transition from the collected revenue to the billed revenue method with sprint for reconciling amounts due to us for accounts receivable during the year ended december  the remaining increase is primarily attributable to subscriber revenue growth 
sprint operating expenses 
sprint operating expenses during the years ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
sprint operating expenses included sprint pcs management fee expense and other fees we paid to sprint pcs for the use of its support services  including billing and collections services and customer care 
for the years ended december  and  sprint pcs management fee expense of approximately million and million  respectively  was reclassified from general and administrative expenses to cost of service and operations in the consolidated statements of operations to conform with current year presentation 
as noted above under network operations expenses  certain expenses were reclassified from network operations expenses to sprint operating expenses for the year ended december  the increase in sprint operating expenses was primarily attributable to the effect of the increase in our subscriber base of approximately million  offset by savings related to the amendment to our sprint agreements effective in of approximately million 
cost of products sold the cost of products sold includes the costs of handsets and accessories and totaled approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cost of handsets generally exceeds the sales price because we subsidize the cost of handsets to subscribers  consistent with industry practice 
handset subsidies on units sold by third parties totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses relate to our distribution channels  sales representatives  sales support personnel  retail stores  advertising programs and commissions 
we incurred selling and marketing expenses of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively

non cash compensation for general and administrative matters during the years ended december  and  non cash compensation for general and administrative matters totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
we apply the provisions of apb no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our equity incentive plan 
in may  we modified  options previously issued to employees and board members under our equity incentive plan to reduce the exercise price to  which was approximately per share above the fair market value on the date of modification 
the modification reducing the exercise price resulted in variable accounting for these options from the date of modification to the date the options are exercised  forfeited or expire unexercised 
in prior years  the fair market value of our common stock had not exceeded the modified price and  as such  no compensation expense had been recorded 
as of december   the market price of our common stock was 
under variable accounting  compensation expense of approximately million was recognized in for the excess of the common stock s fair market value over the modification price on  stock options deemed vested  which remain subject to variable accounting 
depreciation  amortization and accretion depreciation  amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
we depreciate our property and equipment using the straight line method over two to years 
a building owned by us is being depreciated using the straight line method over years 
amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is over years 
accretion expense increases the asset retirement obligation associated with our tower leases  switch site and retail and administrative locations to its present value 
the increase in depreciation  amortization and accretion expense was primarily due to the impact of accelerated depreciation of our existing minicell base stations resulting from our reduction of their estimated useful lives during totaling approximately million and increases in depreciation expense of approximately million resulting from net additions to our network equipment during  offset by an approximate million decrease in amortization expense attributable to the via wireless subscriber base  which was fully amortized as of march  interest income for the years ended december  and  interest income was approximately million and million  respectively

analysis of the years ended december  and customer net additions as of december   we provided personal communications services to approximately  customers  an increase of approximately  from december  during  we added  net new subscribers 
the decrease in net subscribers added was primarily attributable to lower sales due to the intense competition from other national wireless telecommunications companies and tighter credit policies implemented in late february churn churn for the year ended december  was approximately compared to approximately for the year ended december  the decrease in churn was primarily the result of tighter credit policies and the subsequent improvement in the credit quality of the overall customer base resulting in less service being discontinued involuntarily 
at december   the overall mix of our customer base was prime and sub prime 
at december   the overall mix of our customer base was prime and sub prime 
average revenue per user arpu during the years ended december  and  our arpu was approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in arpu primarily resulted from a decrease in overage charges attributable to a higher mix of customers on larger anytime minutes rate plans and lower cancellation fees resulting from lower customer churn 
cost per gross addition cpga cpga was approximately for the year ended december  which was comparable to approximately for the year ended december  revenues subscriber revenue 
subscriber revenue during the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in subscriber revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in our subscriber base of approximately million  partially offset by the decrease in our average revenue per user arpu of approximately million 
roaming and wholesale revenue 
roaming and wholesale revenue during the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in roaming and wholesale revenue was primarily due to increases in non sprint pcs roaming revenue of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in sprint pcs travel revenue of approximately million 
the increase in non sprint pcs roaming revenue was primarily due to the effect of an increase in roaming minutes of approximately million  offset by the effect of a decrease in the average roaming rate we receive from other carriers of approximately million 
the decrease in sprint pcs travel revenue for voice services was primarily due to the effect of a reduction in the reciprocal sprint pcs travel rate of approximately million  partially offset by the effect of increases in travel minutes of use and g data usage of approximately million 
equipment revenue 
equipment revenue totaled approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the effect of higher average retail prices for handsets and accessories of approximately million and the allocation of approximately million of activation revenue to equipment revenue based on relative fair values in accordance with eitf  which we adopted on july  cost of service and operations network operations expenses 
network operations expenses totaled approximately million during the year ended december  compared to approximately million during the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we reclassified certain network operations expenses to sprint operations expenses totaling approximately million and million  respectively  to conform with presentation 
the decrease in network operations expenses was attributable to lower interconnection and backhaul charges of approximately million and million of expense reductions related to the resolution of disputed charges with sprint pcs  offset by an increase in radio communications site rent due to an increase in the number of active radio communications sites from at december  to at december  travel and roaming expenses 
travel and roaming expense totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

 in recording the private placement exchange transaction in the first quarter of these provisions required that the carrying value of the senior notes be recorded at the total future cash payments principal and interest specified by the senior notes  therefore  the senior notes were classified on our balance sheet as long term liabilities and were valued at approximately million as of the transaction date 
as a result  no interest expense related to the senior notes was recognized in future periods

the decrease in net loss was primarily due to the increase in revenues resulting from the increase in our subscriber base  the decrease in bad debt expense resulting from the improvement in the credit quality of the subscriber base  the decrease in interest expense resulting from the debt restructuring and the gain on debt retirements 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we principally relied on the proceeds from equity and debt financings  and to a lesser extent revenues  as our primary sources of capital 
in and  we generated cash flow from operating activities of approximately million and million  respectively 
although we substantially completed our contractually required network coverage build out in  our business could require additional capital expenditures for capacity enhancements and coverage improvements 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
since  we have funded and expect to fund all of our future capital expenditures through cash flows from operating activities 
we announced a network coverage expansion which is expected to cost approximately million and is expected to be completed in as part of this expansion  we entered into an agreement with an equipment vendor to acquire network equipment

on july   operating company completed a registered exchange offer involving the senior notes  pursuant to which all of the outstanding senior notes were exchanged for senior notes that have been registered under the securities act 
the registered senior notes are substantially identical to the unregistered senior notes  except that certain transfer restrictions and registration rights do not apply to the registered senior notes 
under the indenture governing the senior notes  operating company is permitted to issue additional notes from time to time  and did so on october  in connection with the following refinancing transactions 
operating company completed a financing of an additional million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act

as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of approximately million 
management expects cash and cash equivalents  combined with cash flow from operating activities  to be sufficient to meet capital expenditures needs and service debt requirements through december  and into the foreseeable future 
while management does not anticipate the need to raise additional capital to meet our operating or capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future  our funding status is dependent on a number of factors influencing projections of operating cash flows  including those related to gross new customer additions  customer turnover  revenues  marketing costs  bad debt expense and roaming and reseller revenue 
management believes our financial position will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the business including capital expenditures  cash interest and working capital needs 
should actual results differ significantly from these assumptions  our liquidity position could be adversely affected and we could be in a position that would require us to raise additional capital which may not be available or may not be available on acceptable terms

analysis of cash flows a significant portion of our revenues is generated from customers who subscribe to pcs service from us or sprint on contracts that range from one to two years 
our cash flow from operating activities will fluctuate with the size of our subscriber base and indirectly from the size of sprint s subscriber base and the recurring subscriber and roaming revenue streams generated from these customers 
we expect cash flow from operating activities will continue to grow in and in future periods as our subscriber base continues to grow 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the reduction in operating losses and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by increases in accounts receivable and prepaid and other assets 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to a lower operating loss  the resolution of million in disputed charges with sprint pcs and the receipt of an million federal income tax refund

net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million for the year ended december  our debt for debt exchange in february and issuance of series b senior notes resulted in the incurrence of approximately million in financing costs and a million repayment under our senior secured credit facility 
partially offsetting these transactions was the occurrence of a million cash overdraft resulting from checks issued but not presented to banks as of december  reconciliation of non gaap financial measures we utilize certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  to assess our financial performance 
a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that a excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows  or b includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the comparable gaap measure so calculated and presented 
the non gaap financial measures discussed in results of operations are average revenue per user arpu and cost per gross addition cpga 
descriptions of these non gaap financial measures are provided where the particular measures are discussed in results of operations analysis of the years ended december  and  and the following tables reconcile the non gaap financial measures with our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap excluding subscriber data 
year ended december  average revenue per user arpu subscriber revenue    average subscribers    arpu we believe arpu  which calculates the average monthly service revenue per customer  is a useful measure to assist in evaluating our past and forecasting our future subscriber revenue 
in addition  it provides a gauge to compare our subscriber revenue to that of other wireless communications providers  although other wireless communications providers may include or exclude certain items from their calculations which may make the comparison less meaningful 
year ended december  cost per gross addition cpga selling and marketing    add cost of products sold    less equipment revenue    total cpga costs    gross additions    cpga we believe cpga  which measures the average cost to acquire new customers during the period  is a useful measure used to compare our average cost to acquire a new subscriber to that of other wireless communication providers  although other wireless communications providers may include or exclude certain items from their calculations which may make the comparison less meaningful 
the inclusion of cost of products sold net of the equipment revenues earned is critical to our understanding of how much it costs us to acquire a new customer 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had  and will not have  a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
seasonality our business is seasonal because the wireless industry is dependent on fourth quarter results 
among other things  the industry relies on higher customer additions and handset sales in the fourth quarter as compared to the other three fiscal quarters 
the factors contributing to this trend include the increasing use of retail distribution  which is dependent on year end holiday shopping  the timing of new product and service offerings  competitive pricing pressures and aggressive marketing and promotions during the holiday season 
the increased level of activity requires a greater use of our available financial resources during this period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates  including interest rates 
all of the interest rates on our notes are fixed  the weighted average interest rate on our notes was as of december  we have not entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading  speculative or hedging purposes  though we may do so from time to time if such instruments are available to us on acceptable terms and prevailing market conditions are accommodating 
no principal repayments on our notes are due within the next five years
