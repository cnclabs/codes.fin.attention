part i item business corporate background and business strategy spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc is a delaware corporation that was originally incorporated in colorado as americus funding corporation in december  became neotherapeutics  inc in august  was reincorporated in delaware in june  and was renamed spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc in december prior to august  when we announced a shift in our strategic focus  we were engaged in the discovery and development of neurology drugs as well as functional genomics research 
we are a specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the business of acquiring  developing and commercializing prescription drug products for various indications 
our business model is to acquire and develop a diversified portfolio of proprietary and generic drug products  with a mix of near term and long term revenue potential 
while our primary strategic focus is on proprietary drug products addressing cancer and other unmet medical needs  we are also leveraging our developmental and regulatory capabilities  and those of our strategic alliance partners  to enhance the potential for realizing near term revenues by taking advantage of opportunities for developing and commercializing select generic drug products with a focus on specific niche categories 
we plan to execute our business strategy by attracting and retaining talented people  entering into strategic business alliances  and maintaining a strong cash position 
as of the date of filing this report  we have six proprietary drug product candidates under development satraplatin  eoquin tm  elsamitrucin  spi  renazorb tm  and spi  one abbreviated new drug application  or anda  for ciprofloxacin tablets  approved by the united states food and drug administration fda and eight andas pending at the fda 
since august  when we shifted our strategic focus  through the date of this report  we have accomplished the following major milestones recapitalized the company by securing over million in equity financing 
enhanced our research and development capabilities and strengthened our management team 
entered into several strategic business alliances to position the company for growth 

table of contents advanced clinical development of our drug product candidates entered into a co development and license agreement for the development of satraplatin  an orally administered platinum derived chemotherapy agent which has demonstrated an initial indication of efficacy in treating hormone refractory prostate cancer 
satraplatin is currently in a phase trial for hormone refractory prostate cancer 
the costs of conducting clinical trials are being borne entirely by our co development partner gpc biotech ag 
initiated the development of and advanced into a phase trial  eoquin tm  a synthetic prodrug an inactive drug compound which is activated by certain enzymes present in higher amounts in cancer cells than in normal cells  for its intended initial indication  refractory superficial bladder cancer 
initiated the development of and advanced into a phase trial  elsamitrucin  an anti tumor antibiotic that acts as a dual inhibitor of two key enzymes involved in dna replication  topoisomerase i and ii  for its intended initial indication  refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma 
acquired three new proprietary drug product candidates in licensed spi  a lhrh luteinizing hormone releasing hormone  also known as gnrh or gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist and are preparing to commence clinical trials to evaluate it for safety and efficacy in its intended initial indications  hormone dependent prostate cancer and benign prostatic hypertrophy 
we also plan to evaluate the compound for the treatment of endometriosis 
in licensed renazorb tm  two second generation lanthanum based phosphate binding agents  and plan to complete preclinical studies and conduct clinical trials to evaluate it for safety and efficacy in its intended initial indication  hyperphosphatemia  ie  high phosphate levels in blood  in patients with end stage renal kidney disease and or chronic kidney disease 
in licensed spi  an endothelinb agonist which stimulates receptors on endothelial cells to selectively dilate tumor blood vessels and thereby selectively increase the delivery of anti cancer drugs to cancer tissue 
we plan to complete preclinical studies and conduct clinical trials to evaluate spi for safety and efficacy as an adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer 
filed nine andas with the fda seeking approval for marketing generic versions of branded prescription drugs whose patent protection and or marketing exclusivity is scheduled to expire in the near term  or has already expired one of the andas  for ciprofloxacin tablets  a synthetic  broad spectrum anti bacterial agent  was approved by the fda in september one of the andas filed in october  for sumatriptan succinate injection  the generic form of glaxosmithkline s imitrex injection  which is used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks and of cluster headache episodes in adults  included a paragraph iv certification 
glaxosmithkline has commenced suit against us alleging that the filing of our anda infringes their patent 
we believe that the patent that we have challenged covering glaxosmithkline s imitrex injection  which with pediatric exclusivity is set to expire on february   is invalid  unenforceable and or or will not be infringed by our generic product candidate 
imitrex injection is also covered by a patent which together with pediatric exclusivity does not expire until june  this patent is not currently being challenged by any third party 
the other seven andas are still pending at the fda 
we plan to continue to evaluate acquisitions  or in licensing  of additional promising clinical stage as well as near clinical stage drugs from other companies and institutions  and expect to file several andas in and beyond and to have several generic drugs fda approved and marketed in the us over the next years 
in addition  we plan to seek additional strategic alliances to manufacture  develop and market our current and future drug products 

table of contents drug product candidates proprietary drugs new drug development  whereby drug product candidates are tested with a view to filing a new drug application nda or similar filing in other countries and eventually obtaining marketing approval is an inherently uncertain  lengthy and expensive process  requiring several clinical trials to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the us food and drug administration fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states and other countries  that the products are both safe and effective in their respective indications 
our proprietary drug strategy is designed to address the significant risks of drug development by focusing our acquisition and development efforts on clinical stage drug candidates those in human trials 
we do  however  also undertake the acquisition and development of promising pre clinical drug candidates when we believe that the therapy is novel and or when we believe the drug candidates have a higher probability of regulatory approval than that of a typical compound at a similar stage of development 
our proprietary drug candidates  their target indications  and status of development are summarized in the following table  and discussed below in further detail drug candidate target indication development status satraplatin hormone refractory prostate cancer late phase eoquin tm eo refractory superficial bladder cancer late phase elsamitrucin refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma phase spi hormone dependent prostate cancer phase expected to begin in spi benign prostatic hypertrophy phase expected to begin in satraplatin non small cell lung cancer phase eo radiation sensitization pre clinical renazorb tm end stage renal disease  chronic kidney disease pre clinical spi adjunct to chemotherapy pre clinical while other indications have not yet been identified  some of our drug candidates may prove to be beneficial in additional disease indications as we continue to study and develop these drug candidates 
in addition  we have a few neurology compounds that we may out license to third parties for further development 
we believe our proprietary drug candidates have the potential to be effective therapeutic agents with some advantages over existing therapies 
our goal is to develop and  if successful  commercialize these drugs in the united states and worldwide to the extent of the territorial rights in our licenses 
overview of indications we are targeting cancer cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states  accounting for approximately of all deaths 
in its most recent annual report  the american cancer society reported that in the under age group  cancer is the leading cause of death 
in the united states  approximately million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in and over  persons are expected to die from the disease in accordingly  there is significant demand for improved and novel cancer treatments 
cancer occurs when abnormal cells divide without control 
these cells can invade nearby tissues or spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body 
to percent of all cancers are believed to be due to inheriting a faulty gene 
the remaining to percent are believed to be caused by damage to the genes during a person s lifetime 
these damaging agents can be internal  such as hormones or an altered immune system  or external  such as viruses  and exposure to chemicals or harmful ultraviolet 
table of contents sunrays 
sometimes ten or more years may pass between exposure and cancer detection 
cancer is currently treated by surgery  chemotherapy  radiation therapy  hormonal therapy and immunotherapy 
we believe that traditional chemotherapeutic agents are likely to remain the mainstay therapy for cancer for the foreseeable future 
however  we continue to seek additional novel drugs  drug delivery methods and combination therapies that address cancer or cancer related indications with significant unmet medical need 
accordingly  we are actively seeking novel and proprietary oncology drug candidates that have demonstrated initial safety and efficacy in clinical trials and or we believe have a higher probability of regulatory approval than that of a typical compound at a similar stage of development  target cancer indications with significant unmet medical need  where current treatments either do not exist or are not effective  and we believe are acquirable at a fair value based on our judgment of clinical and commercial potential 
benign prostatic hypertrophy benign prostatic hypertrophy is a non cancerous enlargement of the prostate 
enlargement of the prostate is controlled by testosterone 
according to the national institutes of health  benign prostatic hypertrophy affects more than of men over age and as many as of men over the age of treatment options for benign prostatic hypertrophy include surgery and medications to reduce the amount of tissue and increase the flow of urine 
end stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease hyperphosphatemia hyperphosphatemia  or high phosphate levels in blood  affects patients with chronic kidney disease  especially end stage kidney disease patients on dialysis 
it can lead to significant bone disease including pain and fractures and cardiovascular disease  and is independently associated with increased mortality 
treatment of hyperphosphatemia is aimed at lowering blood phosphate levels by restricting dietary phosphorus intake  and using  on a daily basis  and with each meal  oral phosphate binding drugs that facilitate fecal elimination of dietary phosphate rather than its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream 
restricting dietary phosphorus intake has historically not been a successful means of serum phosphate control  and phosphate binders are the mainstay of hyperphosphatemia management 
according to the united states renal data system s annual report and the national kidney foundation  there are an estimated  patients with end stage renal disease in the united states 
the end stage renal disease population is estimated to grow by approximately annually and is expected to reach  patients by we anticipate growth in the use of phosphate binders due to recommendations for expanded use of phosphate binders in stage and stage chronic kidney disease million patients in the united states under the revised national kidney foundation kidney disease outcomes quality initiative  or k doqi  clinical guidelines  trends in treatment toward separating control of phosphate levels from control of calcium levels  based on k doqi guidelines  creating more demand for non calcium  non aluminum phosphate binders  including lanthanum based agents  reimbursement for oral medications for dialysis patients under a new medicare plan  beginning in  and significant room to improve patient compliance  currently as low as for some phosphate binders 
currently marketed therapies for treating hyperphosphatemia include aluminum based phosphate binders  calcium based phosphate binders and non calcium  non aluminum phosphate binders 
under the new national kidney foundation k doqi guidelines  non calcium  non aluminum phosphate binders are recommended as first line or long term therapy for the management of hyperphosphatemia 
our proprietary drug candidates satraplatin satraplatin  an orally administered platinum derived chemotherapy agent  is being developed by our co development partner gpc biotech ag nasdaq gpcb as a second line chemotherapy 
table of contents treatment for its intended initial indication  hormone refractory prostate cancer 
cancer is referred to as refractory when it has not responded or is no longer responding to previous treatment 
prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men 
according to figures released by the american cancer society  approximately  new cases and  deaths will occur in the us during the initial treatment of prostate cancer includes surgery along with radiation therapy and hormonal therapy 
although hormonal therapy is generally very effective  and produces a response in most patients  it is usually non curative 
the average duration of response to initial hormonal treatment is eighteen months 
once the disease progresses after the initial hormonal treatment  it is considered hormone refractory 
for those patients failing hormone therapy  treatment currently involves chemotherapy  which is also non curative and is limited to improvement of symptoms of cancer with only limited prolongation of survival 
platinum compounds continue to represent one of the most widely used classes of chemotherapeutic agents in modern cancer therapy and are typically used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of various types of cancer 
while the platinum compounds currently on the market are intravenously administered  satraplatin is an orally administered compound 
we believe an orally administered platinum derived chemotherapeutic agent may offer important clinical and commercial advantages over platinum drugs that need to be intravenously administered in a hospital setting  including ease of administration and patient convenience 
these advantages  in turn  could potentially lead to improved patient compliance as well as potential cost savings to patients and the healthcare system 
a pivotal phase trial  the sparc satraplatin and prednisone against refractory cancer trial for satraplatin in hormone refractory prostate cancer  was initiated by gpc biotech in september  following completion of a special protocol assessment an assessment by a special committee of the fda 
also in september  the fda granted fast track designation to satraplatin as a second line chemotherapy for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer 
in february  gpc biotech announced the receipt of a scientific advice letter from the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products enabling the phase pivotal trial on satraplatin to proceed in europe using the sparc protocol 
enrollment for the phase pivotal sparc trial is proceeding as planned 
gpc biotech anticipates to begin a rolling nda submission  where gpc can submit different sections of the nda when the sections are ready instead of waiting for the nda to be complete before submission  in  and  assuming positive data  to complete the nda filing in the second half of a phase trial of satraplatin in combination with simultaneous  standard doses of radiotherapy was opened for accrual in patients with locally advanced non small cell lung cancer 
additional clinical trials designed to evaluate the potential of satraplatin for the treatment of other cancers  including in combination with a taxane based therapy  are expected to begin in the decision to pursue hormone refractory prostate cancer as the initial indication for satraplatin was based  among other things  on results from a randomized  patient study initiated in june in first line chemotherapy for hormone refractory prostate cancer sponsored by bristol myers squibb that were presented at the american society of clinical oncology annual meeting in june the data from this study have also been published in the peer reviewed journal oncology 
the data demonstrated statistically significant improvement in time to disease progression and doubling of progression free survival in the satraplatin treated group compared to the control group 
in addition to hormone refractory prostate cancer  satraplatin has shown initial indication of anti tumor activity in ovarian and small cell lung cancers in phase trials conducted to date

eoquin tm eoquin  a synthetic prodrug an inactive drug compound which is activated by certain enzymes present in higher amounts in cancer cells than in normal cells  is currently being developed for its intended initial indication  refractory superficial bladder cancer  or cancer which has not invaded the muscle of the bladder wall 
eoquin tm is the trademarked name for our drug product candidate eo apaziquone 

table of contents the american cancer society estimates that there will be  new cases and  deaths from bladder cancer in in the united states 
superficial bladder cancer accounts for to percent of all cases of bladder cancer at first diagnosis 
the initial treatment of this cancer is surgical removal of the tumor 
because of the high frequency of early recurrences of the tumor  patients are usually prescribed additional therapy to prevent or delay such recurrences 
this additional therapy generally consists of immunotherapy or chemotherapy drugs instilled directly into the bladder 
since eoquin tm is activated to a greater degree within tumor cells  we believe it carries a lesser risk of killing or harming normal body cells 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a multi national  multi center  open label  non randomized phase clinical trial 
the decision to initiate phase trials in this indication was based  among other things  on results from phase trials that demonstrated that eoquin tm had no systemic toxicity  and was well tolerated at the dose level chosen for the phase trials 
more importantly  eoquin tm demonstrated an initial indication of anti tumor activity against refractory superficial bladder cancer  as evidenced by eight of twelve patients showing a complete response  defined as the complete disappearance of the tumor as confirmed by biopsy  after receiving six treatments with eoquin tm over a period of six weeks 
of these eight patients  only one has experienced a recurrence after eighteen months  with the seven other patients disease free for at least six months after treatment and three of the patients disease free for over a year  with the longest follow up over two years 
the primary objective of the phase trial is to evaluate tumor response the level of anti tumor activity of eoquin tm  with time to recurrence and overall safety as the secondary objectives 
we hope to determine the level of anti tumor activity in a larger number of patients 
the current status of the phase trial we completed enrollment of the phase trial 
to date  the phase data has confirmed anti tumor activity against refractory superficial bladder cancer  as evidenced by nineteen of thirty one patients showing a complete response after receiving six weekly treatments with eoquin tm instilled into the urinary bladder 
results also demonstrated that eoquin tm was well tolerated  with no systemic toxicity  and local toxicity limited to chemical cystitis inflammation of the urinary bladder  dysuria difficulty of urination and hematuria blood in the urine 
while follow up was short  no responding patient has relapsed  confirming the response duration observed in a previous phase trial 
in january  we received from the us patent and trademark office a notice of allowance for our patent application for eoquin tm entitled medical compositions for intravesical treatment of bladder cancer 
this patent  when issued  will cover eoquin tm for use in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer in the united states and will not expire until november we may seek european and japanese development and marketing partners for eoquin tm 
we have also initiated an investigation of whether eo may have potential utility as a radiation sensitizer in the treatment of certain cancers 
radiotherapy along with chemotherapy has been the primary treatment for a number of cancers 
certain types of cancer cells can be primed through pre treatment by a radiation sensitizer to respond better to radiation therapy

elsamitrucin elsamitrucin  an anti tumor antibiotic that acts as a dual inhibitor of two key enzymes involved in dna replication  topoisomerase i and ii  is currently being developed for its intended initial indication  refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma 
non hodgkin s lymphoma is a tumor arising from the lymph nodes 
according to the american cancer society  an estimated  new cases and  deaths will occur from non hodgkin s lymphoma in in the us in early stages  localized diseased lymph nodes can be treated with radiation therapy 
later stages of this disease are treated with chemotherapy or with chemotherapy plus radiation and highly specific monoclonal antibodies depending on the type of non hodgkin s lymphoma 
we believe elsamitrucin may 
table of contents prove to be an important addition in treating refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma patients because it has shown some activity when used alone and it has exhibited a relatively low level of associated toxicity 
by inhibiting the activity of the two key enzymes involved in dna replication  elsamitrucin is thought to lead to dna breaks that prevent the correct replication of dna and ultimately result in cancer cell death 
in april  we initiated a multi center  phase trial in patients with refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma 
in clinical trials conducted by us and previously by bristol myers squibb to date  elsamitrucin has also demonstrated a favorable side effect profile 
the current status of the phase trial in november  an abstract on initial positive results from the ongoing phase trial of elsamitrucin in refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma was published in the proceedings of the american society of hematology annual meeting 
elsamitrucin continued to demonstrate early evidence of anti tumor activity against refractory nhl and a favorable side effect profile 
we are continuing to enroll patients in the ongoing phase trial of elsamitrucin in refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma and we expect completion by the end of we plan to initiate additional studies in head and neck cancer and possibly other tumor types 
see business alliances bristol myers squibb for commercial terms relating to elsamitrucin licensing and development 
spi spi  a lhrh luteinizing hormone releasing hormone  also known as gnrh or gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist a substance that blocks the effects of a natural hormone found in the body is currently being evaluated for its intended initial indications  hormone dependent prostate cancer and benign prostatic hypertrophy 
we also plan to evaluate the compound for the treatment of endometriosis 
as described earlier  under satraplatin  prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men 
the initial treatment of prostate cancer includes surgery along with radiation therapy and hormonal therapy 
we believe spi may prove to be an important addition in treating hormone dependent prostate cancer patients because of its ability to induce prolonged testosterone suppression in healthy volunteers as shown in early trials 
there are other lhrh antagonist and agonists a substance that mimics the effects of a natural hormone found in the body that are currently marketed or are being tested for the treatment of the indications we are pursuing 
however  we believe that spi has certain advantages over other lhrh antagonists which include improved solubility  less tendency for aggregation resulting in greater bioavailability absorption by the body and minimal histamine release tendency which should reduce allergic reactions 
we also believe that spi has advantages over lhrh agonists which include immediate and dose dependent suppression of sex hormones and no risk of testosterone surge or clinical flare up 
as described earlier  benign prostatic hypertrophy is a non cancerous enlargement of the prostate which is caused by testosterone 
unlike gnrh like drugs  spi  which is an antagonist of gnrh  has the potential to reduce testosterone just enough to reduce both prostate size and symptoms 
a gnrh antagonist similar to spi is in the late stages of clinical development for benign prostatic hypertrophy 
endometriosis is the displacement of endometrial tissue the mucous lining of the uterus to other organs outside the womb 
endometriosis is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain and infertility in women 
at least million women in north america alone have endometriosis 
based on the stage of the disease the treatment can include hormone therapy or surgery or a combination of both 
current hormonal treatment aims to stop ovulation for as long as possible 
spi is an antagonist blocker of gnrh gonadotropin releasing hormone  a hormone that provokes ovulation 
a gnrh antagonist similar to spi is in the late stages of clinical development for endometriosis 
during the first half of  we plan to initiate clinical trials in hormone dependent prostate cancer and benign prostatic hypertrophy in europe and to file an investigational new drug application with the fda to begin us clinical trials

renazorb tm in january  we acquired rights to renazorb tm  two pre clinical  second generation lanthanum based phosphate binding agents which utilize nanoparticle technology  that have the potential to address hyperphosphatemia  or high phosphate levels in blood  in patients with end stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease 
please see the discussion of hyperphosphatemia above 
we believe that renazorb tm has the opportunity  because of its possible higher capacity for binding phosphate  to significantly improve patient compliance by offering the lowest in class dosage potentially one tablet per meal and smaller sized tablets to achieve the same therapeutic benefit as other phosphate binders  while also potentially offering a more favorable safety side effect profile

spi spi is an endothelinb agonist  which can stimulate receptors on endothelial cells  the innermost  simple layer of cells lining the blood vessels to selectively dilate tumor blood vessels and thereby selectively increase the delivery of anti cancer drugs to cancer tissue 
this technology takes advantage of the fact that there is differential blood supply to the tumors 
tumors get their blood supply from blood vessels that are different from normal blood vessels and mostly have only a layer of endothelium  which contains the endothelial cells 
tumor blood vessels lack smooth muscle and associated innervations found in other blood vessels 
when an endothelinb agonist is administered it stimulates receptors on the endothelial cells and leads to enhanced blood supply selectively to the tumors  because of this enhanced blood supply to the tumor the concentration of injected chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel injection administered after an endothelinb agonist reaches several fold higher in the tumor 
in other words  this increased blood supply to the tumor leads to increased concentration of drugs in the tumor and enhanced tumor kill  possibly without any significant increase in untoward effects to normal tissues 
this result has only been shown in animal studies to date 
we acquired rights for the above mentioned use of this compound in february and plan to evaluate its effectiveness as an adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer

generic drugs the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of signed into law in part to accelerate the approval of generic drugs  created an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  approval process to foster generic competition 
while an anda application is subject to significant regulatory review and scrutiny before approval by the fda  the costs and timelines associated with the development of a generic drug  the overall timelines associated with the completion of regulatory review and subsequent commercialization of the generic drug product can be significantly shorter as compared to the new drug application  or nda  approval process  and relatively less uncertain and less expensive 
our generic drugs  their target indications  and status are summarized in the following table  and discussed below in further detail drug product target indication status ciprofloxacin tablets anti bacterial anda approved september carboplatin injection anti cancer anda pending at the fda fluconazole tablets anti fungal anda pending at the fda sumatriptan succinate injection anti migraine anda pending at the fda other products various andas pending at the fda 
table of contents as a result of the number of branded pharmaceutical products coming off patent over the next decade  combined with the aging us population and cost containment efforts by the us federal government and private insurance payers  we believe the us market for generic drugs will continue to grow 
we plan to capitalize on this growth by focusing our effort in niche categories such as injectable products and oncology drugs where the competition is not as intense and where we can leverage our resources and those of our strategic partners to create synergies with the proprietary drugs we develop 
our generic drug candidates ciprofloxacin 
ciprofloxacin is a synthetic  broad spectrum anti bacterial agent that is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of microorganisms in certain diseases 
ciprofloxacin is available in multiple dosage forms including tablets  oral suspension  otic  intravenous infusion and ophthalmic preparations 
in  through our affiliate neojb and on behalf of jb chemical pharmaceuticals limited  our joint venture partner in neojb  we filed an anda for ciprofloxacin tablets 
we received fda approval of the anda for ciprofloxacin tablets in september our ciprofloxacin tablets are manufactured by jbcpl utilizing its fda approved facility in india 
in late th quarter we recorded  revenue from product sales of the first shipment of ciprofloxacin tablets to the lannett company  our distributor for ciprofloxacin tablets 
in view of the competitive market for sales of ciprofloxacin tablets  we are unable to assess the future revenue potential of this product 
fifteen other companies have received fda approval to market generic versions of ciprofloxacin tablets  and we have observed a significant reduction in the market price for ciprofloxacin tablets since june  when the pediatric exclusivity for ciprofloxacin expired 
fluconazole 
fluconazole is a synthetic anti fungal agent indicated for the treatment of localized and systemic fungal infections 
fluconazole is available in multiple dosage forms including tablets  oral suspension and intravenous infusion 
in  through neojb  we filed an anda for fluconazole tablets on behalf of jbcpl 
we have entered into a supply agreement with jbcpl pursuant to which jbcpl will manufacture fluconazole tablets for neojb utilizing jbcpl s fda approved facility in india 
the patent and pediatric exclusivity for diflucan  the branded form of fluconazole marketed by pfizer inc  had both expired by july if we receive fda approval of our anda  we may begin marketing and selling fluconazole tablets using one or more third party distributors with experience selling generic drug products into retail and institutional channels 
we may not successfully establish distributor arrangements with a qualified third party distributor for this generic drug product 
in addition  the market is very competitive with versions from generic drug manufacturers such as taro pharmaceutical industries  mylan  sandoz  ranbaxy  ivax  genpharm  gedeon richter  teva  torpharm  roxane and pliva approved by the fda for sale in the us due to the significant price erosion of the product caused by the number of companies selling the product we may not market our product if it is not economical to do so 
carboplatin 
carboplatin injection is an anti cancer drug indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in combination with other approved chemotherapeutic agents and for the palliative treatment of patients with ovarian cancer recurrent after prior chemotherapy  including patients treated with cisplatin injection  another chemotherapeutic agent 
the patent and pediatric exclusivity for paraplatin  the branded form of carboplatin injection marketed by bristol myers squibb  had both expired by october  we filed an anda for carboplatin injection and if fda approval for our anda is obtained  we intend to begin marketing and sale of carboplatin injection following such approval 
we will initially likely use one or more third party distributors with particular experience distributing injectable oncology drugs to carry out our distribution plan 
we may not successfully establish distributor arrangements with third party distributors or be able to acquire the necessary quantities of the drug from our supply sources on commercially feasible terms or terms otherwise acceptable to us 
in addition  the fda has granted anda approval to five generic companies  including pharmachemie  app  bedford  mayne and pliva 
teva pharmaceuticals  through an agreement with bristol myers squibb  is currently selling carboplatin produced by bristol myers squibb as a generic drug 
sumatriptan succinate injection sumatriptan succinate injection is marketed by glaxosmithkline under the brand name imitrex and is used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks  with or without aura  
table of contents and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes in adults 
the total us market size for the branded form of sumatriptan succinate injection mg ml  imitrex  is estimated at about million annually 
imitrex is currently covered by two patents 
one patent expires in december  but imitrex has been afforded pediatric exclusivity  until june the second patent expires in august  but pediatric exclusivity protects the product until february in october  we filed an anda with the fda for sumatriptan succinate injection mg ml  seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture and sale of the sumatriptan succinate injection product in the us our anda includes a paragraph iv certification that the second patent expiring february  including the pediatric exclusivity period associated with glaxosmithkline s imitrex injection  is invalid  unenforceable and or or will not be infringed by our generic product candidate 
on february   glaxosmithkline filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware  alleging infringement of this second patent on imitrex 
see litigation and patents and proprietary rights paragraph iv challenge for additional description of the foregoing legal proceedings 
there currently is no legal challenge of the first patent  and therefore  even we were successful in our challenge to the second patent  we will not be able to market our generic product until june in  dr

jb chemicals pharmaceuticals ltd 
jbcpl in  we formed a joint venture  neojb  llc  with jbcpl  an india based pharmaceutical manufacturer  with a view to utilizing jbcpl s existing manufacturing capabilities to produce selected oral prescription drug products for marketing in the united states 
jbcpl operates manufacturing facilities in india  which produce active pharmaceutical ingredients  intermediates building blocks in chemical compounds  finished dosage form pharmaceuticals and herbal remedies 
we own an interest in neojb  llc 
through the date of this report  we have filed three andas on behalf of the joint venture 
in september  the fda approved our anda for ciprofloxacin 
table of contents which is manufactured by jbcpl 
the joint venture purchases product from jbcpl based on market prices prevailing at the time of purchase  and does not have long term volume or price commitments 
in  jbcpl granted neojb an exclusive license to obtain regulatory approval to market and distribute certain products within the united states  including ciprofloxacin tablets and fluconazole tablets 
the agreement provides that we  or neojb  will bear all costs of regulatory approvals for the products and that jbcpl will manufacture and supply to neojb the products in such quantities as neojb may require at prices reasonably acceptable to both parties 
the agreement provides that jbcpl shall not enter into any distribution or sale arrangement or grant any license with respect to any product covered by the agreement in the united states unless it first offers to enter into a supply agreement with neojb pursuant to certain procedures and conditions 
in addition  the agreement provides that neojb shall not  for years from the later of the termination of the agreement or expiration of the applicable patents  market in the united states any products which would compete with the distribution  marketing or sale of the products covered by the agreement 
the agreement continues so long as jbcpl or any of its affiliates is a member of neojb or until jointly terminated by the parties 
in conjunction with the formation of neojb  we granted a five year warrant to jbcpl to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
under our alliance agreement with jbcpl  an entity affiliated with jbcpl agreed to invest million in our common stock 
the first  was invested in following acceptance by the fda of our anda filing for ciprofloxacin  for  shares of our common stock at a price per share of  equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date immediately prior to the date of acceptance of the anda by the fda  and the remaining  which was scheduled for investment in september  upon receipt of the fda approval of the ciprofloxacin anda  was received in february and we issued  shares of common stock  at a price per share equal to  the closing price of our common stock on the date immediately prior to the date of approval of the anda by the fda 
fdc limited fdc in  we entered into an agreement with fdc  an india based pharmaceutical manufacturer  with a view to marketing in the united states certain ophthalmic drugs manufactured by fdc 
fdc manufactures  among other products  active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain oral  ophthalmic and otic drugs at their manufacturing facilities in india  and is engaged in selling certain active pharmaceutical ingredients produced at their fda approved facilities in india into the united states market 
through the date of this report  we have filed four andas for ophthalmic drugs under this alliance 
we do not have long term volume or price commitments  and we anticipate negotiating transfer prices for each product only after fda approval of the corresponding anda is accomplished 
either party may terminate the agreement upon failure to agree to a mutually satisfactory supply price with respect to the products  in which case fdc is prohibited from selling such products within the united states for a price less than that offered to us under the agreement 
the agreement continues until jointly terminated by the parties 
however  either party may terminate the agreement upon the failure to reach certain milestones within specified time periods 
shantha biotechnics pvt 
ltd 
shantha in  we entered into an alliance with shantha  an indian biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development  manufacture and commercialization of human healthcare products produced by recombinant technology for the detection and treatment of cancer and infectious diseases 
we are responsible for all regulatory  marketing and distribution matters in the united states for certain products currently marketed by shantha elsewhere in the world and certain other products under development by shantha 
the product candidates under evaluation for development include oncology biologics  cancer diagnostics  as well as vaccines 
however  there are no current us regulatory guidelines that allow for generic equivalents to branded biologics to be filed with the fda using an abbreviated application and review process 
the fda is working with the pharmaceutical industry at large to better understand the position of the biotech and biopharmaceutical companies regarding the issue of equivalence of biogenerics to the branded products and the equivalence of the processes used to manufacture the active biological ingredient 
until such time that the fda adopts clear guidelines covering biogenerics and or congress creates new laws and regulations that would allow for an abbreviated application  review and approval process for 
table of contents biogenerics we will not be in a position to move forward in the united states on a number of product candidates covered under this agreement 
others in connection with the carboplatin injection and sumatriptan succinate injection andas filed with the fda  we are negotiating commercial supply and service arrangements with sources for the active pharmaceutical ingredients and developmental laboratories with the capacity to manufacture drug products on a commercial scale  after fda approval is received 
when we file additional andas for other drug products  we expect to enter into similar arrangements  if the products are not covered under one of our business alliances mentioned above 
sales  marketing and distribution as described below  the lannett company markets and distributes our first approved drug product  ciprofloxacin tablets 
in we hired a vice president of marketing and sales and  in light of anticipated fda approvals  we may hire additional sales and marketing personnel  as needs dictate 
we also intend to seek alliances with other third parties to assist us in the marketing and sale of our other drug candidates 
the lannett company lannett in  we entered into a sales and distribution agreement with lannett  a philadelphia based pharmaceutical company engaged in the marketing and distribution of prescription drugs 
under the agreement lannett is our exclusive distributor for ciprofloxacin tablets in the united states  and we are obligated to distribute ciprofloxacin tablets only through lannett 
during late th quarter of  subsequent to receipt of fda approval  we sold ciprofloxacin tablets to lannett 
we sell product to lannett based on market prices prevailing at the time of sale  and do not have any long term volume or price commitments 
the agreement contemplates  and the parties expect  that additional products may be added to the agreement from time to time 
lannett agrees that if it decides to distribute any products other than ciprofloxacin tablets under this agreement  that it will not  without our prior written consent  market  distribute or sell any product that competes with such additional products 
the agreement continues for months after the date upon which we were first allowed to sell ciprofloxacin tablets in the united states  unless renewed by mutual agreement 
competition the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
we expect technological developments and improvements in the fields of our business to continue to occur at a rapid rate and  as a result  expect competition to remain intense 
several companies are engaged in research and development of compounds that are similar to our research 
technologies under development by these and other pharmaceutical companies could result in treatments for diseases and disorders for which we are developing our own treatments 
in the event that one or more of those programs is successful  the market for some of our drug candidates could be reduced or eliminated 
any product for which we obtain fda approval must also compete for market acceptance and market share 
competition for proprietary products competing in the branded product business requires us to identify and quickly bring to market new products embodying technological innovations 
successful marketing of branded products depends primarily on the ability to communicate the effectiveness  safety and value to healthcare professionals in private practice  group practices and managed care organizations 
competition for branded drugs is less driven by price and is more focused on innovation in treatment of disease  advanced drug delivery and specific clinical benefits over competitive drug therapies 
unless our proprietary products are shown to have better efficacy and are as cost effective  if not more cost effective  than other alternatives  they may not gain acceptance by the medical field and therefore never be successful commercially 
companies that have products on the market or in research and development that are in the same oncology focus as us include amgen  inc  genentech  inc  bayer ag  eli lilly and co  novartis pharmaceuticals corporation  bristol myers squibb company  glaxosmithkline  biogen idec pharmaceuticals  inc  guilford pharmaceuticals  inc  cephalon  inc  sanofi aventis inc  pfizer  inc  avi 
table of contents biopharma  inc  chiron corp  corixa corp  genta inc  imclone systems incorporated  mgi pharma  inc and supergen  inc  among others 
many of our competitors are large and well capitalized companies focusing on a wide range of diseases and drug indications  and have substantially greater financial  research and development  human and other resources than we do 
furthermore  large pharmaceutical companies have significantly more experience than we do in pre clinical testing  human clinical trials and regulatory approval procedures  among other things 
in treating hyperphosphatemia  under the new national kidney foundation k doqi guidelines  non calcium  non aluminum binders are the recommended first line long term therapy for managing high phosphate levels 
to our knowledge  genzyme corporation s renagel and shire pharmaceuticals fosrenol are the only two fda approved non calcium  non aluminum  branded pharmaceuticals specifically for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in end stage renal disease 
we expect to compete with these products and potentially others based upon phosphate binding capacity  patient compliance  side effects and cost 
while we believe renazorb tm has the potential to perform better than these competitors  renazorb tm is not yet a clinical stage drug and  consequently  if renazorb tm is successfully developed and receives fda approval  it will be a number of years after renagel and fosrenol have been fda approved and marketed 
in addition  genzyme and shire may seek to modify their products or create new therapies that could reduce or eliminate any perceived benefit we believe renazorb tm may have over these products 
competition for generic products the generic drug market is price sensitive and price competitive and revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic drug products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors 
as patents and regulatory exclusivity for brand name products expire  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for the generic equivalents of such products is generally able to achieve significant market penetration and retain market share 
as competing generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products  market share  revenues and gross profit typically decline  in some cases  dramatically 
accordingly  the level of market share  revenues and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product is normally related to the number of competitors in that product s market and the timing of that product s regulatory approval and launch  in relation to competing approvals and launches 
consequently  we must develop and introduce new generic products in a timely and cost effective manner to achieve and maintain significant revenues and gross profit 
in addition to competition from other generic drug manufacturers  we face competition from brand name companies in the generic market 
many of these companies seek to participate in sales of generic products by  among other things  collaborating with other generic pharmaceutical companies through authorized generic programs or by marketing their own generic equivalent to their branded products 
companies that have a significant generic presence include american pharmaceutical partners  bedford laboratories  barr laboratories  sicor  inc  teva pharmaceuticals  dr 
reddy s laboratories  ranbaxy laboratories  mylan laboratories  inc  sandoz  and watson pharmaceuticals  inc 
some additional competitors in the generics market include eon labs  inc  pliva  inc  impax laboratories  inc 
and akorn  inc  a competitor particularly in the field of generic ophthalmic drugs 
please also read our discussion of competition matters in the risk factors section of this report 
research and development from our inception through august  we devoted substantially all of our resources and efforts to early stage drug research and development 
commencing with the launch of our new business strategy in august  we eliminated early stage drug research and development and focused our research and development efforts on development of later stage drug product candidates that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials 
research and development expenditures  including related stock based charges  are expensed as we incur them and were approximately million in  million in  and million in 
table of contents patents and proprietary rights the patent process the united states constitution provides congress with the authority to provide inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries 
congress codified this right in united states code title which gave the patent office the right to grant patents to inventors and defined the process for securing a us patent 
this process involves the filing of a patent application that teaches a person having ordinary skill in the respective art how to make and use the invention in clear and concise terms 
the invention must be novel not previously known and non obvious not an obvious extension of what is already known 
the patent application concludes with a series of claims that specifically describe the subject matter that the patent applicant considers his invention 
the patent office undertakes an examination process that can take from one to five years depending on the complexity of the patent and the problems encountered during examination 
generally  the less novel an invention is  the longer the examination process will last 
in exchange for disclosing the invention to the public  the successful patent applicant is provided a right to exclude others from making  using or selling the claimed invention for a period of years from the filing date of the patent application 
under certain circumstances a patent term may be extended 
patent extensions are most frequently granted in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries under the drug price competition and pricing term restoration act of  or commonly known as the hatch waxman act  to recover some of the time lost during the fda regulatory process  subject to a number of limitations and exceptions 
the patient term may be extended up to a maximum of five years  however  as a general rule  the average extension period granted for a new drug is approximately three years and approximately months for a new medical device 
only one patent can be extended per fda approved product and a patent can only be extended once 
generic drugs and pediatric exclusivity as an incentive for pharmaceutical companies to research the safety and efficacy of their brand name drugs for use in pediatric populations  congress enacted the food drug administration modernization act of which included a pediatric exclusivity for brand name drugs 
this pediatric exclusivity protects drug products from generic competition for six months after their patents expire in exchange for research on children 
for example  if a pharmaceutical company owns a patent covering a brand name drug they can only exclude third parties from selling generic versions of that drug until that patent expires 
however  if the fda grants a brand named drug pediatric exclusivity the fda will not approve of the sale of any generic drugs for six months beyond the patent term covering the brand name drug 
thus  the pediatric exclusivity effectively extends the brand named company s patent protection for six months 
this extension applies to all dosage forms and uses that the original patent s covered 
our patent  proprietary rights and andas we in license from third parties certain patent and related intellectual property rights related to our proprietary products 
in particular  we have licensed patent rights with respect to satraplatin  eoquin tm  elsamitrucin  spi  renazorb tm and spi  in each case for the remaining life of the applicable patents 
except for spi  our agreements generally provide us with exclusive worldwide rights to  among other things  develop  sublicense  and sell the drug candidates 
we are generally responsible for all development  patent filing and maintenance costs  sales  marketing and liability insurance costs 
in addition  these licenses and agreements may require us to make royalty and other payments  to reasonably exploit the underlying technology of applicable patents 
if we fail to comply with these and other terms in these licenses and agreements  we could lose the underlying rights to one or more of our potential products  which would adversely affect our product development and harm our business 
the protection  preservation and infringement free commercial exploitation of these patents and related intellectual property rights is very important to the successful execution of our proprietary drug strategy 
however  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or as to the enforceable scope of the claims 
table of contents of the patent 
accordingly  our patents and the patents we have in licensed may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents 
if our patent applications are not approved or  even if approved  if our patents or the patents we have in licensed  are circumvented or not upheld by the courts  our ability to competitively exploit our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced 
also  such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors  in which case our ability to commercially exploit these products may be diminished 
from time to time  we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop  manufacture and market our products 
if we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  our ability to commercially exploit such products may be inhibited or prevented 
as mentioned above  we have in licensed from third parties certain patent rights related to our proprietary products 
we believe that our patents and licenses are important to our business  but that with the exception of the united states and european patents discussed in this paragraph  relating to our proprietary products  no one patent or license is currently of material importance to our business 
we have two us patents covering satraplatin  a compound patent that expires in and a medical use patent that expires in  and an issued compound patent in europe that expires in various countries between and there is a possibility  under the hatch waxman act  to obtain up to a year extension of one of the us patents for the time spent during the fda regulatory process 
there are similar extension possibilities in europe 
for eoquin tm  the us compound patent expires in  however  we recently received from the us patent and trademark office a notice of allowance for a patent application for eoquin tm that  when issued  will cover eoquin tm for use in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer and will not expire until november in europe  we have an issued compound patent that expires in various countries in and we have a patent application pending for the treatment of bladder cancer 
for elsamitrucin  the us and europe patents have already expired  however  we anticipate filing future us and european patent applications covering new formulations or uses for this product 
for spi  we have a us compound patent issued that will expire in  and in europe we have a patent application pending 
for renazorb tm  there are compound patents pending in the united states and europe 
for spi  we have filed method of use patent applications in us and europe 
we are constantly evaluating our patent portfolio and considering new patent applications in order to maximize the life cycle of each of our products 
while the united states and the european union are currently the largest markets for most our proprietary products  we also have patents issued and patent applications pending outside of the united states and europe 
limitations on patent protection in these countries  and the differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in countries outside the united states  may limit the protection we have on patents issued or licensed to us outside of the united states 
in addition  laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as would laws in the united states 
to minimize our costs and expenses and to maintain effective protection  we usually focus our patent and licensing activities within the united states  the european union  canada and japan 
in determining whether or not to seek a patent or to license any patent in a certain foreign country  we weigh the relevant costs and benefits  and consider  among other things  the market potential and profitability  the scope of patent protection afforded by the law of the jurisdiction and its enforceability  and the nature of terms with any potential licensees 
failure to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary drugs and technology would impair our ability to be commercially competitive in these markets 
we also hold us and foreign patent rights related to our neurology drug candidates 
all neurology patents were assigned to us by the inventors  including dr 
alvin glasky  our former chairman and ceo  and mcmaster university  for certain royalty payments 
we may out license these patent rights for further development 
in addition to the specific intellectual property subjects discussed above  we have trademark protection for eoquin tm and renazorb tm 
we will likely register trademarks for the branded names of our proprietary drug products 

table of contents in conducting our business generally  we rely upon trade secrets  know how  licensing arrangements and customary practices for the protection of our confidential and proprietary information such as confidentiality agreements 
it is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance  and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
it is also possible that our trade secrets or know how will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
the protection of know how is particularly important because the know how is often the necessary or useful information that allows us to practice the claims in the patents related to our proprietary products 
we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation concerning patents  trademarks  copyrights and proprietary technologies can often be protracted and expensive and  as with litigation generally  the outcome is inherently uncertain 
see risk factors for more information 
in connection with andas filed on behalf of jbcpl and fdc  we have the exclusive license to market and distribute those drugs within the united states  if and when approved by the fda 
we own the andas for carboplatin and sumatriptan succinate injection 
paragraph iv certification in  congress enacted the hatch waxman act in part to establish a streamlined approval process for the fda to use in approving generic versions of previously approved branded drugs 
under the hatch waxman act  for each patent listed in the orange book  where branded companies are required to list their patents for branded products  for the relevant branded drug  an anda applicant must certify one of the following claims that there is no patent information listed  that such patent has expired  that the proposed drug will not be marketed until expiration of the patent  or that either the proposed generic drug does not infringe the patent or the patent is invalid  otherwise known as paragraph iv certification 
if an anda applicant files a paragraph iv certification  the hatch waxman act requires the applicant to provide the patent holder with notice of that certification and provides the patent holder with a day window  during which it may bring suit against the applicant for infringement 
if patent litigation is initiated during this period  the fda may not approve the anda until the earlier of months from the patent holder s receipt of the notice the month stay or the issuance of a final  non appealed  or non appealable court decision finding the patent invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
if the patent is found to be infringed by the filing of the anda  the patent holder could seek an injunction to block the launch of the generic product until the patent expires 
often more than one company will file an anda that includes a paragraph iv certification 
however  the hatch waxman act provides that such subsequent anda applications will not be approved until days after the earlier of the date of the first commercial marketing of the first filed anda applicant s generic drug or the date of a decision of a court in an action holding the relevant patent invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
thus  the hatch waxman act effectively grants the first filed anda holder days of marketing exclusivity for the generic product 
for more information on our anda with paragraph iv certification for sumatriptan succinate injection  please see our generic drug candidates sumatriptan succinate injection 
please also read our discussion of patent and intellectual property matters in the risk factors section of this report 
governmental regulation the production and marketing of our proprietary and generic drug products are subject to regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  drugs are subject to rigorous regulation 
the federal food  drug and cosmetics act  as amended from time to time  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  
table of contents storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our proposed products 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework  including for drugs already at a clinical stage of development  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with  and approved by  the fda 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to regular inspections by the fda and must comply with good manufacturing practices 
to supply products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturing establishments must also comply with good manufacturing practices and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by regulatory authorities in certain of such countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
general information about the drug approval process the united states system of new drug approval is one of the most rigorous in the world 
only a small percentage of compounds that enter the pre clinical testing stage are ever approved for commercialization 
our proprietary drug strategy focuses on in licensing clinical stage drug candidates that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials 
this strategic focus on clinical stage drug candidates those eligible for human trials is designed to address certain risks of drug development by shortening the timeline to marketability and reducing the risk of failure  both of which are higher with an early stage product 
the following general comments about the drug approval process are relevant to the development activities we are undertaking with our proprietary drugs 
pre clinical testing during the pre clinical testing stage  laboratory and animal studies are conducted to show biological activity of a drug compound against the targeted disease and the compound is evaluated for safety 
investigational new drug application after pre clinical testing  an investigation new drug application is submitted to the fda to begin human testing of the drug 
phase clinical trials after an investigational new drug application becomes effective  phase human clinical trials can begin 
these trials  involving small numbers of healthy volunteers or patients usually define a drug candidate s safety profile  including the safe dosage range 
phase clinical trials in phase clinical trials  controlled studies of volunteer human patients with the targeted disease are conducted to assess the drug s effectiveness 
these studies are designed primarily to determine the appropriate dose levels  dose schedules and route s of administration  and to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug on humans  as well as to determine if there are any side effects on humans to expand the safety profile following phase phase clinical trials this phase usually involves large numbers of patients with the targeted disease 
during the phase clinical trials  physicians monitor the patients to determine the drug candidate s efficacy and to observe and report any adverse reactions that may result from long term use of the drug on a large  more widespread  patient population 
during the phase clinical trials  the drug candidate is compared to either a placebo or a standard treatment for the target disease 
new drug application after completion of all three clinical trial phases  if the data indicates that the drug is safe and effective  a new drug application is filed with the fda 
we estimate that approval of a new drug application for a cancer drug generally takes six months to three years 
fast track review the fda has established procedures for accelerating the approval of drugs to be marketed for serious life threatening diseases for which the manufacturer can demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
one of our drug candidates  satraplatin  has been given a fast track designation for the hormone refractory prostate cancer indication 
phase clinical trials after a drug has been approved by the fda  phase studies are conducted to explore additional patient populations  compare the drug to a competitor  or to further study the risks  benefits and optimal use of a drug 
these studies may be a requirement as a condition of the initial approval of the nda 

table of contents abbreviated new drug application anda the abbreviated new drug application is particularly relevant for our business strategy 
an anda is the abbreviated review and approval process created by the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of signed into law in part for the accelerated approval of generic drugs 
when a company files an anda  it must make a patent certification if there are any patents covering the branded product listed in the fda s orange book 
an anda applicant must make one of four certifications that there is no patent information listed in the orange book  that the listed patent has expired  that the listed patent will expire on a stated date or that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product 
the anda must also demonstrate both chemical equivalence and bio equivalence the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug in the body is substantially equivalent to the brand name product  unless a bio equivalence waiver is granted by the fda in the case of an injectable generic drug to the brand name product 
the anda drug development and approval process generally takes less time than the nda drug development and approval process since the anda process does not require new clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of the drug product 
we estimate that approval of an abbreviated new drug application generally takes one to two years 
approval if the fda approves the new drug application  the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe to patients for treatment 
the marketing of a drug after fda approval is subject to substantial continuing regulation by the fda  including regulation of adverse event reporting manufacturing practices and the advertising and promotion of the drug 
failure to comply with fda and other governmental regulations can result in fines  unanticipated compliance expenditures  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of ndas  andas or other product applications enforcement actions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
although we have internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
see risks factors our failure to comply with extensive governmental regulation to which we are subject may delay or prevent approval of our product candidates and may subject us to penalties 
the generic drug enforcement act of established penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an anda 
under this act  the fda has the authority to permanently or temporarily bar companies or individuals from submitting or assisting in the submission of an anda  and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market generic drugs 
the fda may also suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct and or withdraw approval of an anda and seek civil penalties 
the fda can also significantly delay the approval of any pending nda  anda or other regulatory submissions under its fraud  untrue statements of material facts  bribery and illegal gratuities policy 
as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies  and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies 
the impact of this new requirement  and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers  is uncertain and could adversely affect our business 
continuing studies of the proper utilization  safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by industry  government agencies and others 
such studies  which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques  can call into question the utilization  safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted  and may in the future result  in the discontinuance of their marketing

our cumulative losses since our inception in through december  were in excess of million 
we lost approximately million in  million in and million in we expect to continue to incur losses in the future  particularly as we continue to invest in the development of our drug product candidates  acquire additional drug candidates and expand the scope of our operations 
we recently received approval to market our first generic drug product  ciprofloxacin  in the united states and recorded modest revenue in however  we currently do not sell any other products or services and we may never achieve significant revenues from sales of products or become profitable 
even if we eventually generate significant revenues from sales  we will likely continue to incur losses over the next several years 
our business does not generate the cash needed to finance our ongoing operations and therefore  we will need to raise additional capital 
our current business operations do not generate sufficient operating cash to finance the clinical development of our drug product candidates 
we have historically relied primarily on raising capital through the sale of our securities  and or out licensing our drug candidates and technology  to meet our financial needs 
while anticipated profits from the sale of generic drugs  if we are successful in generating significant revenues from generics  may help defray some of the expenses of operating our business  we believe that in order to prepare the company for continued future drug product development and acquisition  and to capitalize on growth opportunities  we will  for the foreseeable future  need to continue to raise funds through public or private financings 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms  if at all 
accordingly  we may be forced to significantly change our business plans and restructure our operations to conserve cash  which would likely involve out licensing or selling some or all of our intellectual  technological and or tangible property not presently contemplated and at terms that we believe would not be favorable to us and or reducing the scope and nature of our currently planned research and drug development activities 
an inability to raise additional capital would also impact our ability to expand operations 
clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our proprietary drug candidates  which could prevent or significantly delay obtaining regulatory approval 
prior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our proprietary drug candidates  we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well controlled clinical trials  and to the satisfaction of the fda  and other regulatory authorities in the united states and other countries that each of the products is both safe and effective 
for each product candidate  we will need to demonstrate the efficacy and monitor its safety throughout the process 
if such development is unsuccessful  our business and reputation would be harmed and our stock price would be adversely affected 
all of our product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development 
the results of pre clinical studies and early stage clinical trials of our product candidates do not necessarily predict the results of later stage clinical trials 
later stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that a product candidate 
table of contents is safe and effective despite having progressed through initial clinical testing 
even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our drug candidates are promising  such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda or any other united states or foreign regulatory approval 
pre clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways 
accordingly  fda officials could interpret such data in different ways than we or our partners do  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the fda  other regulatory authorities  our institutional review boards  our contract research organization  or we may suspend or terminate our clinical trials for our drug candidates 
any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates  or in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any drugs resulting from our drug candidates  may severely harm our business and reputation 
even if we receive fda and other regulatory approvals  our product candidates may later exhibit adverse effects that may limit or prevent their widespread use  may cause fda to revoke  suspend or limit their approval  or may force us to withdraw products derived from those candidates from the market 
our proprietary drug candidates  their target indications  and status of development are summarized in the following table drug candidate target indication development status satraplatin hormone refractory prostate cancer late phase clinical trial eoquin tm eo refractory superficial bladder cancer late phase clinical trial elsamitrucin refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma phase clinical trial spi hormone dependent cancers phase clinical trial spi benign prostatic hypertrophy phase clinical trial satraplatin non small cell lung cancer phase clinical trial eo radiation sensitizer pre clinical renazorb tm end stage renal disease  chronic kidney disease pre clinical spi adjunct to chemotherapy pre clinical the development of our drug candidate  satraplatin  depends on the efforts of a third party and  therefore  its eventual success or commercial viability is largely beyond our control 
in  we entered into a co development and license agreement with gpc biotech ag for the development and commercialization of our lead drug candidate  satraplatin 
gpc biotech has agreed to fully fund development and commercialization expenses for satraplatin 
we do not have control over the drug development process and therefore  the success of our lead drug candidate depends upon the efforts of gpc biotech 
gpc biotech may not be successful in the clinical development of the drug  the achievement of any additional milestones such as the acceptance of a new drug application  or nda  filing by the fda  or the eventual commercialization of satraplatin 
the development of our drug candidate  spi  may be adversely affected by the development efforts of zentaris gmbh who retained certain rights to the product 
zentaris gmbh licensed the rights to us to develop and market spi in the united states  canada  mexico and india 
zentaris may conduct their own clinical trials on spi for regulatory approval in other parts of the world 
we will not have control over zentaris efforts in this area and our own development efforts for spi may be adversely impacted if their efforts are not successful 
from time to time we may need to license proprietary technologies from third parties  which may be difficult or expensive to obtain 
we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to successfully develop  manufacture and market our drug products 
as an example  it may be necessary to utilize a third party s proprietary technology to reformulate one of our drug products in order to improve upon 
table of contents the capabilities of the drug product 
if we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on reasonable terms  our ability to commercially exploit our drug products may be inhibited or prevented 
our limited experience at managing and conducting clinical trials ourselves may delay the trials and increase our costs 
we may manage and conduct some future clinical trials ourselves rather than hiring outside clinical trial contractors 
while some of our management has had experience at conducting clinical trials  we have limited experience in doing so as a company 
if we move forward with self conducted clinical trials  our limited experience may delay the completion of our clinical trials and increase our costs 
the inability to retain and attract key personnel could significantly hinder our growth strategy and might cause our business to fail 
our success depends upon the contributions of our key management and scientific personnel  especially dr 
rajesh c 
shrotriya  our chairman  president and chief executive officer and dr 
luigi lenaz  our chief scientific officer 
dr 
shrotriya has been president since and chief executive officer since  and has spearheaded the major changes in our business strategy and coordinated our structural reorganization 
dr 
lenaz has been president of our oncology division since and chief scientific officer since  and has played a key role in the identification and development of our proprietary drug candidates 
the loss of the services of dr 
shrotriya  dr 
lenaz or any other key personnel could delay or preclude us from achieving our business objectives 
dr 
shrotriya has an employment agreement with us that will expire on december   with automatic one year renewals thereafter unless we  or dr 
shrotriya  give notice of intent not to renew at least days in advance of the renewal date 
dr 
lenaz has an employment agreement with us that will expire on july   with automatic one year renewals thereafter unless dr 
lenaz or we give notice of intent not to renew at least days in advance of the renewal date 
we also may need substantial additional expertise in marketing and other areas in order to achieve our business objectives 
competition for qualified personnel among pharmaceutical companies is intense  and the loss of key personnel  or the delay or inability to attract and retain the additional skilled personnel required for the expansion of our business  could significantly damage our business 
we are dependent on third parties for clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing our proposed proprietary products 
if we are not able to secure favorable arrangements with such third parties  our business and financial condition could be harmed 
we may not conduct clinical trials ourselves  and we will not manufacture any of our proposed proprietary products for commercial sale nor do we have the resources necessary to do so 
in addition  we currently do not have the capability to market our drug products ourselves 
we intend to contract with larger pharmaceutical companies or contract research organizations to conduct such activities 
in connection with our efforts to secure corporate partners  we may seek to retain certain co promotional and or co marketing rights to certain of our proprietary drug candidates  so that we may promote our products to selected medical specialists while our corporate partner promotes these products to the medical market generally 
we may not be able to enter into any partnering arrangements on this or any other basis 
if we are not able to secure adequate partnering arrangements  our business and financial condition could be harmed 
in addition  we will have to hire additional employees or consultants  since our current employees have limited experience in these areas 
sufficient employees with relevant skills may not be available to us 
any increase in the number of our employees would increase our expense level  and could have an adverse effect on our financial position 
in addition  we  or our potential corporate partners  may not successfully introduce our proposed proprietary products or our proposed proprietary products may not achieve acceptance by patients  health care providers and insurance companies 
further  it is possible that we may not be able to secure arrangements to manufacture and market our proposed proprietary products at prices that would permit us to make a profit 
to the extent that clinical trials are conducted by corporate partners  we may not be able to control the design and conduct of these clinical trials 

table of contents our efforts to acquire or in license and develop additional proprietary drug candidates may fail  which would limit our ability to grow our proprietary business 
the long term success of our strategy depends in part on obtaining drug candidates in addition to our existing portfolio 
we are actively seeking to acquire  or in license  additional proprietary drug candidates that demonstrate the potential to be both medically and commercially viable 
we have certain criteria that we are looking for in any drug candidate acquisition and therefore  we may not be successful in locating and acquiring  or in licensing  additional desirable drug candidates on acceptable terms 
we are a small company relative to our principal competitors and our limited financial resources may limit our ability to develop and market our drug products 
many companies  both public and private  including well known pharmaceutical companies and smaller niche focused companies  are developing products to treat all of the diseases we are pursuing  or distributing generic drug products directly competitive to the generic drugs we intend to market and distribute 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  research and development  manufacturing  marketing and sales experience and resources than us 
as a result  our competitors may be more successful than us in developing their products  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing their products to consumers 
competition for branded drugs is less driven by price and is more focused on innovation in treatment of disease  advanced drug delivery and specific clinical benefits over competitive drug therapies 
we have six proprietary drug candidates currently under development 
we may not be successful in any or all of these studies  or if successful  and if one or more of our proprietary drug candidates is approved by the fda  we may encounter direct competition from other companies who may be developing products for similar or the same indications as our drug candidates 
companies active in the areas of oncology which is our focus include astra zeneca  amgen  inc  bayer ag  eli lilly and co  genentech  inc  novartis pharmaceuticals corporation  bristol myers squibb company  glaxosmithkline  biogen idec pharmaceuticals  inc  guilford pharmaceuticals  inc  cephalon  inc  sanofi aventis inc  pfizer  inc  chiron corp  genta inc  imclone systems incorporated  mgi pharma  inc  supergen  inc  roche pharmaceuticals and others who are more established and are currently marketing products for the treatment of various forms of cancer including the forms our oncology drug candidates target 
many of our competitors are large and well capitalized companies focusing on a wide range of diseases and drug indications  and have substantially greater financial  research and development  human and other resources than we do 
furthermore  large pharmaceutical companies have significantly more experience than we do in pre clinical testing  human clinical trials and regulatory approval procedures  among other things any proprietary product for which we obtain fda approval must compete for market acceptance and market share 
for example  cisplatin injection and carboplatin injection are the most prevalent platinum based derivatives used in chemotherapy and are the primary treatment for many of the cancer types we are pursuing 
our drug candidate  satraplatin  if the fda approves it for sale  would likely compete against these drugs directly 
unless satraplatin is shown to have better efficacy and is as cost effective  if not more cost effective  than cisplatin and carboplatin  it may not gain acceptance by the medical field and therefore may never be successful commercially 
with regard to our drug product candidate  renazorb tm  in treating hyperphosphatemia  under the new national kidney foundation k doqi guidelines  non calcium  non aluminum binders  are the recommended first line long term therapy for managing high phosphate levels 
genzyme corporations s renagel and shire pharmaceutical s fosrenol are the only two fda approved non calcium  non aluminum  branded pharmaceuticals specifically for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in end stage renal disease 
we expect to compete with these products and potentially others based upon phosphate binding capacity  patient compliance  side effects and cost 
while we believe renazorb tm has the potential to perform better than these competitors  if renazorb tm is successfully developed and receives fda approval  it will be a number of years after renagel and fosrenol have been fda approved and marketed 
in addition  genzyme and shire may seek to modify their products or create new therapies that could reduce or eliminate any perceived benefit we believe renazorb tm may have over these products 

table of contents our success in the marketing of our generic drug products will depend significantly upon our ability to forecast market conditions that may prevail after we obtain anda approval and identify generic drugs that our strategic partners and associated suppliers can produce for us cost effectively 
in addition  we must be able to expand our marketing  selling and distribution relationships in the united states since we currently do not have any internal distribution capabilities and an alliance with a single product distributor 
furthermore  as a new generic competitor entering the marketplace which is made up of many well established companies  with established customers as well as established sales  marketing and distribution organizations we may not be able to successfully compete 
since price is the primary basis for competition among generic versions of a given drug  any ability by our competitors to reduce production costs can provide them with a significant competitive advantage  and our ability to compete will be largely dependent on our ability to obtain supplies of our generic drug product from manufacturers at favorable prices 
as a new generic competitor  we will be competing against established generic companies such as teva pharmaceuticals  sandoz  barr laboratories  mylan laboratories inc  watson pharmaceuticals  inc  genpharm  dr 
reddy s  ranbaxy  american pharmaceutical partners  bedford laboratories and others 
these companies may have greater economies of scale in the production of their products and in certain cases may produce their own product supplies  such as active pharmaceutical ingredients  or can procure product supplies on more favorable terms which may provide significant cost and supply advantages to customers in the retail prescription market we expect that the generic market will be competitive and will be largely dominated by the competitors listed above who will target many if not all of the same products for development as spectrum 
we currently have eight generic drug candidates under review at the fda 
for ciprofloxacin tablets  our first generic product candidate filed with fda  and for which we obtained approval in september  there are currently fifteen generic manufacturers approved to sell versions of ciprofloxacin tablets  which include apotex  barr  cobalt  taro  teva  west ward  eon labs  carlsbad technology  ivax  sandoz  genpharm  ranbaxy  dr 
reddy s  martec and mylan laboratories  inc the pediatric exclusivity for diflucan  the branded form of fluconazole  our second generic product filed with the fda  expired on july  the market is very competitive with versions from generic drug manufacturers such as taro pharmaceutical industries  mylan laboratories  inc  sandoz  ranbaxy  ivax  genpharm  gedeon richter  teva  torpharm  roxane and pliva approved by the fda for sale in the us we have not yet obtained approval from the fda for fluconazole tablets and can give no assurance for when approval is likely to come  if at all 
carboplatin injection  our third generic drug anda filed with fda  is the generic equivalent of bristol meyers squibb s brand paraplatin  for which the patent expired in april the fda granted approval  following the expiration of pediatric exclusivity in october  for carboplatin injection to five generic companies  including pharmachemie  app  bedford  mayne and pliva 
teva pharmaceuticals  through an agreement with bristol myers squibb  is currently selling carboplatin injection produced by bristol myers squibb as a generic drug 
we have not yet obtained approval from the fda for carboplatin injection and can give no assurance for when approval is likely to come  if at all 
the patent for imitrex injection  the brand name for sumatriptan succinate injection  for which we filed an anda with paragraph iv certification  has not yet expired 
however  we have initiated a challenge of the patent and are currently in litigation with glaxosmithkline  the patent holder for imitrex injection 
based on the guidelines available to us  and our experience with the fda approval process  we do not anticipate receiving approval for our five other andas  filed in and in  before the first quarter of  if at all  and all approvals will come after patents and or exclusivities expire and after some of our competitors have already obtained approval 
our proprietary drug candidates may not be more effective  safer or more cost efficient than competing drugs and otherwise may not have any competitive advantage  which could hinder our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates 
drugs produced by other companies are currently on the market for each disease type we are pursuing 
even if one or more of our drug candidates ultimately received fda approval  our drug candidates may not have better efficacy in treating the target indication than a competing drug  may not have a more favorable side effect profile than a competing drug  may not be more cost efficient to manufacture or apply  or otherwise 
table of contents may not demonstrate a competitive advantage over competing therapies 
accordingly  even if fda approval is obtained for one or more of our drug candidates  they may not gain acceptance by the medical field or become commercially successful 
price and other competitive pressures may make the marketing and sale of our generic drugs not commercially feasible and not profitable 
the generic drug market in the united states is extremely competitive  characterized by many participants and constant downward price pressure on generic drug products 
consequently  margins are continually reduced and it is necessary to continually introduce new products to achieve and maintain profitability 
we have only obtained regulatory approval for one of our generic drug candidates 
while we have entered into agreements with third parties to manufacture the drug products for us  given the price volatility of the generic market  we believe it is imprudent to enter into definitive agreements on transfer prices with the manufacturers of our generic drug product candidates prior to fda approval  and we do not expect to do so until we receive fda approval and are ready to begin selling the generic drug products 
our ability to compete effectively in the generic drug market depends largely on our ability to obtain transfer price agreements that ensure a supply of our generic drug products at favorable prices 
even if we obtain regulatory approval to market one or more generic drug candidates in the united states  we may not be able to complete a transfer price arrangement with the manufacturers of the drug candidates that will allow us to market any generic drug products in the united states on terms favorable to us  or at all 
also  if we fail to obtain approval of our andas from the fda in a timely manner  preferably before the patent and any additional exclusivity granted by the fda to the branded drug product expire  our profitability will be significantly affected due to the significant price erosion caused by the typically large number of the generic companies entering the market 
the us patent and pediatric exclusivity for cipro  the branded form of our generic drug product ciprofloxacin  had both expired by june we received approval from the fda of our anda for ciprofloxacin tablets in september  however  fifteen other companies have received fda approval to market generic versions of ciprofloxacin tablets  and we have observed a significant reduction in the market price for ciprofloxacin since june the patents and all exclusivities for our four ophthalmic products and our one undisclosed product have previously expired  and a number of other companies are currently selling their own generic versions of the products 
in addition  we did not obtain approval of our andas for fluconazole tablets and carboplatin injection prior to the expirations in july and october  respectively  of the patents and exclusivities granted by the fda to the corresponding branded products 
consequently  our ability to achieve a profit may be significantly harmed as we have observed significant reductions in the market prices for these products as well 
the patents for sumatriptan succinate injection  the generic version of imitrex  marketed by glaxosmithkline  for which we filed an anda with paragraph iv certification in october  have not yet expired 
on february   glaxosmithkline filed suit in us federal court to prevent us from proceeding with the commercialization of our generic product which action formally initiates our challenge of the patent listed by glaxosmithkline in connection with imitrex injection 
for information regarding the risks of this litigation  please see the next risk factor below 
in addition to competitive pressures related to price  we may face opposition from the producers of the branded versions of the generic drugs for which we obtain approval 
branded pharmaceutical companies have aggressively sought to prevent generic competition  including the extensive use of litigation 
in addition  many branded pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition 
these efforts have included pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of one patent  which could extend patent protection for a number of years or otherwise delay the launch of generics  using the citizen petition process  a process by which any person can submit a petition to the commissioner of the fda to issue  amend or revoke a regulation or order or take or refrain from taking any other administrative action  to request amendments to fda standards  
table of contents seeking changes to the united states pharmacopoeia  an organization which publishes industry recognized compendia of drug standards  and attaching patent extension amendments to non related federal legislation 
we may not be successful in expanding our generic drug distribution capabilities in the united states  our only target market for generic drugs  which would limit our ability to grow our generic drug business 
many of our competitors have substantial  established direct and indirect distribution channels 
we have not yet undertaken the marketing and distribution of a generic drug product ourselves and we currently have no direct sales and marketing organization and our limited sales and marketing resources are devoted to establishing and enhancing our third party distribution relationships 
we have established a relationship with a distributor for the distribution of ciprofloxacin  and commenced distribution of ciprofloxacin tablets during the fourth quarter of the long term success in the marketing of our generic drugs will depend in part on our drug distribution capabilities in the us  our only target market for generic drugs 
we may not be successful in expanding our existing distribution channel  establishing new  additional distribution channels or establishing a direct generic drug marketing capability sufficient to effectively and successfully compete in the generic drug market 
we may not be successful in establishing additional generic drug supply relationships  which would limit our ability to grow our generic drug business 
long term success in the marketing of generic drugs depends in part on our ability to expand and enhance our existing relationships and establish new relationships for supplying generic drug products 
we do not presently intend to focus our research and development efforts on developing active pharmaceutical ingredients or the dosage form for generic drugs 
in addition  we currently have no capacity to manufacture generic drug products and do not intend to spend our capital resources to develop the capacity to do so 
therefore  we must rely on relationships with other companies to supply our generic drug products 
we may not be successful in expanding or enhancing our existing relationships or in securing new relationships 
if we fail to expand our existing relationships or secure new relationships  our ability to expand our generic drug business will be harmed 
our supply of drug products will be dependent upon the production capabilities of our supply sources  which may limit our ability to meet demand for our products and ensure regulatory compliance 
we have no internal manufacturing capacity for our drug product candidates  and therefore  we have entered into agreements with third party manufacturers to supply us with our drug products  subject to further agreement on pricing for particular drug products 
consequently  we will be dependent on our manufacturing partners for our supply of drug products 
some of these manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states 
the manufacture of drug products  including the acquisition of compounds used in the manufacture of the finished drug product  may require considerable lead times 
further  with regard to our generic drug products  sales of a new generic drug product may be difficult to forecast 
we will have little or no control over the production process 
accordingly  while we do not currently anticipate shortages of supply  there could arise circumstances in which market demand for a particular generic product could outstrip the ability of our supply source to timely manufacture and deliver the product  thereby causing us to lose sales 
reliance on a third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured products ourselves  including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and adhering to fda s current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  requirements  the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control and the possibility of termination or non renewal of the agreement by the third party  based on its own business priorities  at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us 
before we can obtain marketing approval for our product candidates  our supplier s manufacturing facilities must pass an fda pre approval inspection 
in order to obtain approval  all of the facility s manufacturing methods  equipment and processes must comply with cgmp requirements 
the 
table of contents cgmp requirements govern all areas of record keeping  production processes and controls  personnel and quality control 
any failure of our third party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations  including an fda pre approval inspection and cgmp requirements  could result in sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products  delay  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of product  operation restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business 
glaxosmithkline filed suit in us federal court asserting that spectrum has infringed their patent for imitrex injection by filing our anda for sumatriptan injection  the generic form of imitrex injection 
this challenge may prevent us from commercializing sumatriptan until after the patent has expired and may require us to incur substantial expense and the significant effort of technical and management personnel 
on february   glaxosmithkline filed suit in us federal court to prevent us from proceeding with the commercialization of our generic form of sumatriptan injection 
since patent litigation has been initiated  the fda will not approve our anda until the earlier of months from the glaxosmithkline s receipt of our notice of anda acceptance the month stay or the issuance of a final non appealed  or non appealable court decision finding the imitex patent invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
if the patent is found to be infringed by the filing of our anda  glaxosmithkline could seek an injunction to block the launch of our generic product until the patent expires 
this would prohibit us from obtaining the day marketing exclusivity afforded by the fda to companies who are the first to file an anda with a paragraph iv certification for a generic equivalent to a brand name product 
we believe we are the first to file the anda for sumatriptan injection 
our defense against the charge of infringement by glaxosmithkline could require us to incur substantial legal expense and to divert significant effort of our technical and management personnel away from their regular activities in our business  which could substantially hinder our ability to conduct  advance and grow our business 
risks related to our industry rapid technological advancement may render our drug candidates obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in connection with their development 
as a result  certain drug products may never become profitable 
the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology 
technologies under development by other pharmaceutical companies could result in treatments for diseases and disorders for which we are developing our own treatments 
several other companies are engaged in research and development of compounds that are similar to our research 
a competitor could develop a new technology  product or therapy that has better efficacy  a more favorable side effect profile or is more cost effective than one or more of our drug candidates and thereby cause our drug candidate to become commercially obsolete 
some drug candidates may become obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred in their development 
as a result  such products may never become profitable 
competition for patients in conducting clinical trials may prevent or delay product development and strain our limited financial resources 
many pharmaceutical companies are conducting clinical trials in patients with the disease indications that our drug candidates target 
as a result  we must compete with them for clinical sites  physicians and the limited number of patients who fulfill the stringent requirements for participation in clinical trials 
also  due to the confidential nature of clinical trials  we do not know how many of the eligible patients may be enrolled in competing studies and consequently not available to us 
our clinical trials may be delayed or terminated due to the inability to enroll enough patients to complete our clinical trials 
patient enrollment depends on many factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of the trial protocol  the proximity of patients to 
table of contents clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study 
the delay or inability to meet planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and delays or termination of the trial  which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop products 
we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval to market and sell our proprietary or generic drug candidates 
before our proprietary drug candidates can be marketed and sold  regulatory approval must be obtained from the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies 
we must demonstrate to the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states and abroad that our product candidates satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy 
we will need to conduct significant additional research  pre clinical testing and clinical testing  before we can file applications with the fda for approval of our product candidates 
the process of obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals is time consuming  expensive  and difficult to design and implement 
the review and approval  or denial  process for an application can take years 
the fda  or comparable foreign regulatory agencies  may not timely  or ever  approve an application 
among the many possibilities  the fda may require substantial additional testing or clinical trials or find our drug candidate is not sufficiently safe or effective in treating the targeted disease 
this could result in the denial or delay of product approval 
our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals 
further  a competitor may develop a competing drug or therapy that impairs or eliminates the commercial feasibility of our drug candidates 
in order to obtain approval for our generic drug candidates  we will need to scientifically demonstrate that our drug product is safe and bioequivalent to the innovator drug 
bioequivalency may be demonstrated by comparing the generic drug candidate to the innovator drug product in dosage form  strength  route of administration  quality  performance characteristics and intended use 
we plan to use our management s experience with the regulatory approval process in the united states to prepare  file and prosecute appropriate abbreviated new drug applications  or andas  for our current and future generic drug candidates 
since we have filed nine andas with the fda 
in september  we received approval from the fda to market ciprofloxacin tablets in the united states 
we intend to file additional andas in the foreseeable future 
the fda may not agree that our safety and bioequivalency studies provide sufficient support for approval 
this could result in denial or delay of fda approval of our generic products 
generic drugs generally have a relatively short window in which they can be profitable before other manufacturers introduce competing products that impose downward pressure on prices and reduce market share for other versions of the generic drug 
consequently  delays in obtaining fda approval may also significantly impair our ability to compete 
our failure to comply with extensive governmental regulation to which we are subject may delay or prevent approval of our product candidates and may subject us to penalties 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose many requirements on the introduction of new drugs through lengthy and detailed clinical testing and data collection procedures  and other costly and time consuming compliance procedures 
these requirements apply to every stage of the clinical trial process and make it difficult to estimate when any of our drug candidates will be available commercially  if at all 
while we believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable fda regulations  if we  our partners  or contract research organizations fail to comply with the regulations applicable to our clinical testing  the fda may delay  suspend or cancel our clinical trials  or the fda might not accept the test results 
the fda  an institutional review board at our clinical trial sites  our third party investigators  any comparable regulatory agency in another country  or we  may suspend clinical trials at any time if the trials expose subjects participating in such trials to unacceptable health risks 
further  human clinical testing may not show any current or future product candidate to be safe and effective to the satisfaction of the fda or comparable regulatory agencies or the data derived from the clinical tests may be unsuitable for submission to the fda or other regulatory agencies 
once we submit a drug candidate for commercial sale approval  the fda or other regulatory agencies may not issue their approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
if we are delayed or fail to obtain these approvals  our 
table of contents business and prospects may be significantly damaged 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates  we  our partners  our manufacturers  and other contract entities will continue to be subject to extensive requirements by a number of national  foreign  state and local agencies 
these regulations will impact many aspects of our operations  including testing  research and development  manufacturing  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  quality control  adverse event reporting  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our future products 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could  among other things  result in fines  changes in advertising  revocation or suspension of regulatory approvals of products  product recalls or seizures  delays  interruption  or suspension of product distribution  marketing and sale  civil or criminal sanctions  and refusals to approve new products 
the later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products may result in restrictions of the product candidate  including withdrawal from manufacture 
in addition  the fda may revisit and change its prior determinations with regard to the safety and efficacy of our future products 
if the fda s position changes  we may be required to change our labeling or to cease manufacture and marketing of the challenged products 
even prior to any formal regulatory action  we could voluntarily decide to cease the distribution and sale or recall any of our future products if concerns about their safety or effectiveness develop 
in their regulation of advertising  the fda and the federal trade commission from time to time issue correspondence alleging that some advertising or promotional practices are false  misleading or deceptive 
the fda has the power to impose a wide array of sanctions on companies for such advertising practices  and the receipt of correspondence from the fda alleging these practices could result in any of the following incurring substantial expenses  including fines  penalties  legal fees and costs to comply with the fda s requirements  changes in the methods of marketing and selling products  taking fda mandated corrective action  which may include placing advertisements or sending letters to physicians  rescinding previous advertisements or promotions  and disruption in the distribution of products and loss of sales until compliance with the fda s position is obtained 
if we were to become subject to any of the above requirements  it could be damaging to our reputation  and our business condition could be adversely affected 
physicians may prescribe pharmaceutical products for uses that are not described in a product s labeling or differ from those tested by us and approved by the fda 
while such off label uses are common and the fda does not regulate physicians choice of treatments  the fda does restrict a manufacturer s communications on the subject of off label use 
companies cannot actively promote fda approved pharmaceutical products for off label uses  but they may disseminate to physicians articles published in peer reviewed journals 
if our promotional activities fail to comply with the fda s regulations or guidelines  we may be subject to warnings from  or enforcement action by  the fda 
legislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system and pharmaceutical industry may hurt our ability to sell our products profitably or at all 
in both the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  there have been and may continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system and pharmaceutical industry in 
table of contents ways that could impact upon our ability to sell our products profitably 
for example  sales of our products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payers such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations including pharmacy benefit managers and other health care related organizations 
both the federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation  rules and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care 
as an example  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  the medicare modernization act  was recently enacted 
this legislation provides a new medicare prescription drug benefit beginning in and mandates other reforms 
also  the passage of the medicare modernization act reduces reimbursement for certain drugs used in the treatment of cancer 
although we cannot predict the full effects on our business of the implementation of this new legislation  it is possible that the new benefit  which will be managed by private health insurers  pharmacy benefit managers and other managed care organizations  will result in decreased reimbursement for prescription drugs  which may further exacerbate industry wide pressure to reduce the prices charged for prescription drugs 
this could harm our ability to market our products and generate revenues 
it is also possible that other proposals will be adopted 
as a result of the new medicare prescription drug benefit  or any other proposals  we may determine to change our current manner of operation which could harm our ability to operate our business efficiently 
existing regulations that affect the price of pharmaceutical and other medical products may also change before any of our products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any of our products we are developing 
in addition  third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
our products may not be considered cost effective  or adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investments 
in addition  new court decisions  fda interpretations  and legislative changes have modified the rules governing eligibility for and the timing of day market exclusivity periods  a period of marketing exclusivity that the fda may grant to an anda applicant who is the first to file a legal challenge to patents of branded drugs 
we believe we were the first to file an anda for sumatriptan succinate injection  the generic form of glaxosmithkline s imitrex injection  and are currently in litigation with glaxosmithkline regarding the patent that covers this product 
however  it is difficult to predict the effects such changes may have on our business or our current case 
any changes in fda regulations  procedures  or interpretations may make anda approvals of generic drugs more difficult or otherwise limit the benefits available to us through the granting of day marketing exclusivity 
if we are not able to exploit the day exclusivity period for our sumatriptan succinate injection anda or one of our generic product candidates that we were first to file  for any reason  our product may not gain market share  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
as part of the medicare modernization act  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies  and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies 
the impact of this new requirement  and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers  is uncertain and could adversely affect our business 
additional government regulations  legislation  or policies may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse government action that may arise from future legislation or administrative action  either in the united states or abroad 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we might not be permitted to market our products and our business could suffer 

table of contents if we are unable to adequately protect our technology or enforce our patents  our business could suffer 
our success with proprietary products that we develop will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for these products 
we currently have a number of us and foreign patents issued and pending 
we cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our pending patent applications or any patent applications we may file in the future 
if our pending and future patent applications are not approved or  if approved  if such patents are not upheld in a court of law  it may reduce our ability to competitively exploit our patented products 
also  such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by our competitors  in which case our ability to commercially exploit these products may be diminished 
we also rely on trade secret protection and contractual protections for our unpatented  confidential and proprietary technology 
trade secrets are difficult to protect 
while we enter into proprietary information agreements with our employees  consultants and others  these agreements may not successfully protect our trade secrets or other confidential and proprietary information 
it is possible that these agreements will be breached  or that they will not be enforceable in every instance  and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
it is also possible that our trade secrets will become known or independently developed by our competitors 
if we are unable to adequately protect our technology  trade secrets or proprietary know how  or enforce our patents  our business  financial condition and prospects could suffer 
intellectual property rights are complex and uncertain and therefore may subject us to infringement claims 
the patent positions related to our proprietary and generic drug candidates are inherently uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues 
although we are not aware of any infringement by any of our drug candidates on the rights of any third party  there may be third party patents or other intellectual property rights relevant to our drug candidates of which we are not aware 
third parties may assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us with respect to our proprietary drug candidates or our generic drug products 
this could draw us into costly litigation as well as result in the loss of our use of the intellectual property that is critical to our business strategy 
intellectual property litigation is increasingly common and increasingly expensive and may result in restrictions on our business and substantial costs  even if we prevail 
patent and other intellectual property litigation is becoming more common in the pharmaceutical industry 
litigation is sometimes necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement  to enforce our patent rights  to protect trade secrets or to determine the scope and validity of proprietary rights of third parties 
other than the lawsuit filed against us by glaxosmithkline related to our anda for sumatriptan injection  currently no third party has asserted that we are infringing upon their patent rights or other intellectual property  nor are we aware or believe that we are infringing upon any third party s patent rights or other intellectual property 
we may  however  be infringing upon a third party s patent rights or other intellectual property  and litigation asserting such claims might be initiated in which we would not prevail or we would not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on reasonable terms  if at all 
all such litigation  whether meritorious or not  as well as litigation initiated by us against third parties  is time consuming and very expensive to defend or prosecute and to resolve 
in addition  if we infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we could lose our right to develop  manufacture or sell our products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  which could harm our business  financial condition and prospects 
if our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the united states that claim technology we also claim  we may have to participate in interference proceedings required by the patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial costs  even if we ultimately prevail 
results of interference proceedings are highly unpredictable and may result in us having to try to obtain licenses in order to continue to develop or market certain of our drug candidates 

table of contents we may be subject to product liability claims  and may not have sufficient product liability insurance to cover any such claims  which may expose us to substantial liabilities 
we may be exposed to product liability claims from patients who participate in our clinical trials or from consumers of our products 
although we currently carry product liability insurance in the amount of at least million in the aggregate  it is possible that this coverage will be insufficient to protect us from future claims 
further  we may not be able to maintain our existing insurance or obtain or maintain additional insurance on acceptable terms for our clinical and commercial activities or that such additional insurance would be sufficient to cover any potential product liability claim or recall 
failure to maintain sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects and results of operations if claims are made that exceed our coverage 
the use of hazardous materials in our research and development efforts imposes certain compliance costs on us and may subject us to liability for claims arising from the use or misuse of these materials 
our research and development efforts involved and may involve the use of hazardous materials  including biological materials  chemicals and radioactive materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the storage  use and disposal of these materials and some waste products 
we believe that our safety procedures for the storage  use and disposal of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local regulations 
however  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
if there were to be an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  which could exceed our financial resources 
we currently maintain insurance coverage for injuries resulting from the hazardous materials we use  and for pollution clean up and removal  however  future claims may exceed the amount of our coverage 
currently the costs of complying with federal  state and local regulations are not significant  and consist primarily of waste disposal expenses 
risks related to our stock there are a substantial number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market 
the sale of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
any future equity issuances by us may have dilutive and other effects on our existing stockholders 
as of march   there were approximately million shares of our common stock outstanding  and in addition  security holders held options  warrants and preferred stock which  if exercised or converted  would obligate us to issue up to approximately million additional shares of common stock 
a substantial number of those shares  when we issue them upon conversion or exercise  will be available for immediate resale in the public market 
in addition  we have filed a shelf registration statement that allows us to sell up to million of our securities  some or all of which may be shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock  and all of which would be available for immediate resale in the market 
we may issue and sell all of these securities within two years after january   the date of the effectiveness of the registration statement 
if we were to sell the full million available under the registration statement as common stock at a price equal to the current market price of our common stock as of the date of the effectiveness of the registration statement  we would issue approximately million new shares of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fall as a result of resales of any of these shares of common stock due to the increased number of shares available for sale in the market 
we have financed our operations  and for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to finance a substantial portion of our operating cash requirements  primarily by issuing and selling our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock 
any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and may have a dilutive impact on our other stockholders 
these issuances would also cause our net income  if any  to decrease or our loss per share to decrease in future periods 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could drop 

table of contents the market price and volume of our common stock fluctuate significantly and could result in substantial losses for individual investors 
the stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price and volume of our common stock to decrease 
in addition  the market price and volume of our common stock is highly volatile 
factors that may cause the market price and volume of our common stock to decrease include fluctuations in our results of operations  timing and announcements of our technological innovations or new products or those of our competitors  fda and foreign regulatory actions  developments with respect to patents and proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or others  changes in health care policy in the united states and in foreign countries  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  the pharmaceutical industry generally and general market conditions 
in addition  the market price and volume of our common stock may decrease if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
while a decrease in market price could result in direct economic loss for an individual investor  low trading volume could limit an individual investor s ability to sell our common stock  which could result in substantial economic loss as well 
during  the price of our common stock ranged between and  and the daily trading volume was as high as  shares and as low as  shares 
during through march   the price of our common stock has ranged between and  and the daily trading volume has been as high as  shares and as low as  shares 
provisions of our charter  bylaws and stockholder rights plan may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or replace current management even if doing so would benefit our stockholders  which may lower the price an acquirer or investor would pay for our stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  as amended  and bylaws may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or replace our current management 
these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to amend our bylaws without stockholder approval  the inability of stockholders to call special meetings  the ability of members of the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board of directors  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent  unless such consent is unanimous  the establishment of advance notice requirements for nomination for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
these provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and could delay  discourage or prevent someone from acquiring our business or replacing our current management  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
in december  we adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which we distributed rights to purchase units of our series b junior participating preferred stock 
the rights become exercisable upon the earlier of ten days after a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock or ten business days after a tender offer has commenced that would result in a person or group beneficially owning or more of our outstanding common stock 
these rights could delay or discourage someone from acquiring our business  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
we currently have no stockholders who own or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future 
our current policy is to retain all funds and any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business 

table of contents item properties our corporate administrative offices are located in a two story  square foot facility containing office and laboratory space  constructed for us in irvine  california 
the lease on this facility was renewed effective july  for a five year period through june   at an average base monthly rental rate of approximately  over the five year term  plus taxes  insurance and common area maintenance 
at the end of the lease term we have one five year renewal option 
this facility is suitable and adequate to undertake our current and anticipated future operations 
currently we have sub leased  through november  approximately half the facility consisting of laboratory space 
we also lease a small administrative office in zurich  switzerland on an expense sharing basis 
the financial and other terms of this lease are not material to our business 
item legal proceedings sumatriptan succinate injection paragraph iv litigation in october  we filed with the fda an anda for sumatriptan succinate injection mg ml  seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture  sale  and use of the sumatriptan succinate injection product in the united states 
sumatriptan succinate is marketed by glaxosmithkline under the brand name imitrex and is used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes in adults 
glaxosmithkline has two patents for sumatriptan succinate injection listed in the fda s orange book  which is the fda s listing of approved drug products 
the exclusivity afforded the patents listed in the orange book for imitrex injection expire on june  and february   in each case including extensions for pediatric exclusivity 
our anda includes a paragraph iv certification that the later to expire patent associated with glaxosmithkline s imitrex injection  is invalid  unenforceable and or or will not be infringed by our generic product candidate 
on february   glaxosmithkline filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware  alleging infringement of the patent on imitrex 
pursuant to the hatch waxman act  the fda is stayed for months from approving our anda until the earlier of a final  non appealed or non appealable court decision finding the patent invalid  unenforceable or not infringed or the expiration of the month stay 
the month stay began running when glaxosmithkline filed suit in federal court alleging patent infringement of their orange book listed patent 
often more than one company will file an anda that includes a paragraph iv certification 
however  the hatch waxman act provides that such subsequent anda applications will not be approved until days after the earlier of the date of the first commercial marketing of the first filed anda applicant s generic drug or the date of a decision of a court in an action holding the relevant patent invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
thus  the hatch waxman act effectively grants the first filed anda holder days of marketing exclusivity for the generic product 
we believe that our anda was the first filed anda in connection with sumatriptan succinate injection mg ml 
if the patent is found to be infringed by the filing of our anda  glaxosmithkline could seek an injunction to block the launch of our generic product until the patent expires 
while it is not possible to determine with any degree of certainty the ultimate outcome of the foregoing legal proceedings  we believe that we have substantial and meritorious basis with respect to our paragraph iv challenge of glaxosmithkline patent for sumatriptan succinate injection mg ml 
other we are sometimes involved in matters of litigation that we consider ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of our operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere  including risk factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to our ability to successfully develop  obtain regulatory approvals for and market our products  our ability to generate and maintain sufficient cash resources to increase investment in our business  our ability to identify new product candidates  the timing or results of pending or future clinical trials  actions by the fda and other regulatory agencies  demand and market acceptance for our approved products and the effect of changing economic conditions 
overview spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc is a specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the business of acquiring  developing and commercializing prescription drug products for various indications 
while we own patent rights to certain product candidates  the drug products we are currently developing  which are focused on the treatment of cancer and other unmet medical needs  are in licensed from third parties whereby we acquired exclusive development and commercialization rights from the holders of patents for those compounds 
we are also actively engaged in seeking fda approval for marketing generic versions of branded drugs whose patent protection is scheduled to expire in the near term  or has already expired 
in september  the fda granted us approval to market ciprofloxacin  the generic version of the anti bacterial drug cipro  which is marketed by bayer 
new drug development is an inherently uncertain  lengthy and expensive process 
we focus our research and development efforts on clinical stage drug candidates  for which the primary expenses relate to the conduct of clinical trials necessary to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the us food and drug administration  or fda  and other regulatory authorities in the united states and other countries  that the products are both safe and effective in their respective indications and that they can be produced by a validated consistent manufacturing process 
the number  size  scope and timing of the clinical trials necessary to bring a product candidate to development completion and commercialization cannot readily be determined at an early stage  nor  given the timelines of the trials extending over periods of years  can future costs be estimated with precision 
while generic drug development is also subject to approval by regulatory authorities  the costs and timelines of development completion and commercialization can be significantly shorter  and compared to new drug development  relatively less uncertain and less expensive 
business outlook our primary business focus for  and beyond  will be to continue to acquire and develop a portfolio of marketable prescription drug products with a mix of near term and long term revenue potential 
as of the date of filing this report  we have six proprietary drug product candidates under development satraplatin  eoquin tm  elsamitrucin  spi  renazorb tm  and spi  and to date have filed nine andas with the fda  including that for ciprofloxacin  which was approved in september 
table of contents funding for satraplatin clinical trials is being borne entirely by our co development partner gpc biotech 
we are funding the phase clinical trials of eoquin and elsamitrucin  and plan to fund the development  including clinical trials  of spi  renazorb tmand spi we have eight drug products for which we have andas pending with the fda fluconazole tablets  injectable carboplatin and sumatriptan succinate  and five other drug products 
we expect to receive approval by the fda of our andas for carboplatin and fluconazole in the first half of we may not receive approval for our other pending andas  filed in and early  before the first quarter of  if at all 
our goal is to continue to acquire or license additional promising drug product candidates for clinical stage development  and to pursue additional anda filings  including several injectable products  and to have several generic drugs fda approved and marketed in the us over the next years 
in this regard we are evaluating several general drug candidates for feasibility 
the evaluation of feasibility includes many factors  including  but not limited to  evaluation of market potential  competition  potential patent extensions  and availability of active pharmaceutical ingredients and manufacturing capacity 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our current business operations do not generate sufficient operating cash to finance the clinical development of our drug product candidates 
our cumulative losses  since inception in  through december   have exceeded million 
we expect to continue to incur significant additional losses as we implement our growth strategy of developing marketable drug products for at least the next several years unless they are offset  if at all  by licensing revenues under our out license agreement with gpc biotech ag and any profits from the sale of generic products 
we believe that the approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we had on hand as of december   will allow us to fund our current planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
while anticipated profits from the sale of generic drugs  if we are successful in generating revenues from generics  may help defray some of the expenses of operating our business  we believe that in order to prepare the company for future drug product acquisition and development  and to capitalize on growth opportunities  we will  for the foreseeable future  need to continue to raise funds through public or private financings 
our operations have historically been financed by the issuance of capital stock because it is generally difficult to fund pharmaceutical research and development via borrowings due to the significant expenses involved  lack of revenues sufficient to service debt and the significant inherent uncertainty as to results of research and the timing of those results 
in this regard  while we have no imminent need for additional funding  we filed a shelf registration statement  in january  that would enable to raise million  should we elect to do so 
as described elsewhere in this report  including the risk factors section  our drug development efforts are subject to the considerable uncertainty inherent in any new drug development 
due to the uncertainties involved in progressing through clinical trials  and the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval and in establishing collaborative arrangements  among other factors  we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and ultimate aggregate cost of developing each of our drug product candidates  and are similarly unable to reasonably estimate when  if ever  we will realize material net cash inflows from our proprietary drug product candidates 
accordingly  the following discussion of our current assessment of the need for cash to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months may prove too optimistic and our assessment of expenditures may prove inadequate 
over the past two years  since the inception of our current business strategy in august  our expenditures for research and development and general and administrative expenses  excluding license acquisition costs  have been largely incurred on non product specific  or indirect  costs such as personnel  occupancy and other fixed costs representing approximately of total expenditures 
we anticipate that over the next twelve months  such indirect costs will range between approximately million and million 
in 
table of contents addition  we incur product specific development costs such as upfront license fees  milestone payments  active pharmaceutical ingredient api  clinical trials  patent search legal costs  and product liability insurance  among others 
the following describes our current assessment of product specific development costs for each significant proprietary product  and generics as a group  currently under development 
as we mentioned above  these costs are subject to uncertainties inherent in new drug development 
in addition  the expenses are not necessarily cumulative 
we may reduce the amount we spend on one product to shift our cash resources to another product 
therefore  what we actually spend to develop a particular product may not fall within the estimated range and the estimated ranges may change from quarter to quarter based upon changes in priorities or strategy and or the results of the development 
while we do not receive any funding from third parties for research and development we conduct  our estimated costs could be mitigated should we enter into co development agreements for any of our drug product candidates 
satraplatin the costs of conducting clinical trials are being borne entirely by our co development partner gpc biotech 
while we have licensed the development of satraplatin to gpc biotech  we are not obligated to reimburse gpc biotech for development costs they incur or to refund any license or milestone payments we receive 
eoquin through december   excluding indirect costs described earlier  we have spent approximately million on the development of eoquin  including approximately  during the year ended december  estimated expenditures for the next twelve months are subject to considerable uncertainty  and are largely dependent on the analysis of phase clinical trial data that is expected to be available in the first half of we anticipate that over the next twelve months we may incur development costs ranging between approximately million and million 
elsamitrucin through december   excluding indirect costs described earlier  we have spent approximately  on the development of elsamitrucin  including approximately  during the year ended december  estimated expenditures for the next twelve months are subject to considerable uncertainty  and are largely dependent on the completion of enrollment in the phase clinical trial and positive results 
we anticipate that over the next twelve months we may incur development costs ranging between approximately million and million 
spi through december   excluding indirect costs described earlier  we have spent approximately million in cash and equity on the acquisition of spi because we acquired rights to this compound recently  estimated expenditures for the next twelve months are subject to considerable uncertainty 
depending on the indications we develop the product for  we may incur development costs ranging between approximately million and million over the next twelve months 
renazorb tm in january  we entered into a license agreement with altair nanotechnologies  inc  whereby we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize for all human therapeutic and diagnostic uses  renazorb tm  two second generation lanthanum based phosphate binding agents  which utilize altair s proprietary lanthanum nanoparticle technology and have the potential to treat hyperphosphatemia  or high phosphate levels in blood  in patients with end stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease 
we paid altair an upfront payment of  shares of restricted spectrum common stock and made an equity investment of  for  shares of altair common stock  and are obligated to make future payments contingent upon the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones 
in addition  we will pay royalties and sales milestones on net sales  if any  after marketing approval is obtained from regulatory authorities 
as of the date of this report we are unable to reliably estimate the development costs for renazorb tm because we only recently acquired the rights to the compound and we are still in the early stages of planning for future development 
however  upon successful achievement of one of the development milestones  which is anticipated to occur in  we will be obligated to issue altair  shares of our restricted common stock 
spi in february  we entered into a license agreement with chicago labs  inc  whereby we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize spi  an endothelinb 
table of contents agonist  which we believe may selectively dilate tumor blood vessels and thereby selectively increase the delivery of anti cancer drugs to cancer tissue  for the prevention and treatment of cancer 
we paid chicago labs an upfront fee of  and are obligated to make future payments contingent upon the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones 
in addition  we will pay royalties and sales milestones on net sales  if any  after marketing approval is obtained from regulatory authorities 
as of the date of this report we are unable to reliably estimate the development costs for spi because we only recently acquired the rights to the compound and we are still in the early stages of planning for future development 
in addition to the foregoing drug product candidates  we continually evaluate proprietary products for acquisition 
if we are successful in licensing additional products  our research and development expenditures would increase 
while we are contingently obligated to make cash milestone payments  aggregating approximately million as of december   under our licensing agreements given the unpredictability of the results to be derived from those trials  we believe that it is unlikely that any material cash milestone payment obligation will be triggered in the next months 
further  if we reach a milestone  it will likely occur prior to revenues being generated from the related compound 
however  in connection with the milestone obligations related to one of our drug product candidates  satraplatin  each of our contingent future cash payment obligations is generally matched by a corresponding  greater cash payment milestone obligation of gpc biotech to us 
generic drugs through december   we have spent approximately million on the development of generic drugs  including costs for products that we anticipate filing andas for in the future 
over the next twelve months we expect to incur development costs ranging between million and million 
we do not receive any funding from third parties for research and development we conduct for generic products  nor do we pay our generic alliance partners for any research and development they incur in the development of andas for regulatory approval 
marketing of ciprofloxacin tablets  our first generic drug  commenced in the fourth quarter of fifteen other companies have received fda approval to market generic versions of ciprofloxacin tablets  and we have observed a significant reduction in the market price for ciprofloxacin tablets since june  when the pediatric exclusivity for ciprofloxacin expired 
we expect to receive approval by the fda of our andas for carboplatin injection and fluconazole tablets in the first half of the marketing exclusivity for bristol myers squibb s branded form of carboplatin injection expired in october  and the fda has granted anda approval to five generic companies  including pharmachemie  app  bedford  mayne and pliva 
teva pharmaceuticals  through an agreement with bristol myers squibb  is currently selling carboplatin injection produced by bristol myers squibb as a generic drug 
the marketing exclusivity for pfizer s branded form of fluconazole tablets expired in july  and the fda has approved generic versions from several companies  including taro pharmaceutical industries  mylan  sandoz  ranbaxy  ivax  genpharm  gedeon richter  teva  torpharm  roxane and pliva 
we have observed significant price declines in the marketplace for each of the foregoing products 
accordingly  given the competition faced by these products and the fact that we are still seeking alliances with third parties to assist us in the marketing and sale of flucanazole tablets and carboplatin injection  we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate potential revenues or profits from these generic products in the foreseeable future 
net cash used in operating activities during the years ended december  and  the net cash used in operations  for research and development and general and administrative expenses  was approximately million and million respectively 
the increase of million is primarily due to an increase in in research and development expenditures of approximately million  combined with a decrease of approximately million in licensing fee revenue  payment in of compensation accrued at december   and increases in accounts receivable and inventory 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities as described in our accounting policy for cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  we invest our cash in a variety of investments pending its use in our business 
in order to maximize the interest yield on our investments  we invested in investments which do not meet the definition of cash equivalents  and are classified as marketable securities on the balance sheet 
as of december  and  the change in the carrying amount of marketable securities predominantly accounted for the net cash used in investing activities during the years ended december  and  approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase of approximately million in was primarily due to the investment in marketable securities of excess funds  including the approximately million cash provided by financing activities during net cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the approximately million in was comprised of approximately million from the issuance in april of approximately million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock  plus million from the exercise of options and warrants for approximately  shares of our common stock 
offsetting these cash inflows was a  payment of our capital lease obligations during the year 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including cash requirements  from assessing planned research and development activities and general and administrative requirements  required clinical trial activity  market need for our drug candidates and other major business assumptions 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of our judgment 
we consider the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent obligations in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
our most significant assumptions are employed in estimates used in estimating stock based charges  determining values of financial instruments and accrued obligations  as well as in estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy 
the estimation process requires assumptions to be made about future events and conditions  and as such  is inherently subjective and uncertain 
actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
in estimating the fair value of stock based compensation  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
we estimate future volatility based on past volatility of our common stock  and we estimate the expected length of the option on several criteria  including the vesting period of the grant  and the expected volatility 
in estimating the fair value of restricted common stock we issue in connection with licensing transactions  we apply a discount  for the marketability restrictions  which discount is calculated after considering past volatility of our common stock  as well as the term of restriction and the cost of risk free capital for a period that is comparable with the term of the restriction on the shares 

table of contents cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily consist of corporate debt and equity and municipal obligations  including market auction debt securities  but also include government agency notes  certificates of deposit  bank checking and time deposits  and institutional money market funds 
we classify highly liquid short term investments  with insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of days or less at the time of acquisition  as cash and cash equivalents 
other investments  which do not meet the above definition of cash equivalents  are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale marketable securities  in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
investments that we intend to hold for more than one year are classified as long term investments 
patents and licenses we own or license all the intellectual property that forms the basis of our business model 
we expense all licensing and patent application costs as they are incurred 
revenue recognition license fees representing non refundable payments received upon the execution of license agreements are recognized as revenue upon execution of the license agreements where we have no significant future performance obligations and collectibility of the fees is assured 
milestone payments  which are generally based on developmental or regulatory events  are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved  collectibility is assured  and we have no significant future performance obligations in connection with the milestones 
in those instances where we have collected fees or milestone payments but have ongoing future obligations related to the development of the drug product  revenue recognition is deferred and amortized ratably over the period of our future obligations 
revenue from sales of product is recognized upon shipment of product when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  and provisions for estimates  including promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable 
such revenue is recorded net of such estimated provisions 
we state the related accounts receivable at net realizable value  with any allowance for doubtful accounts charged to general operating expenses 
research and development research and development expenses are comprised of the following types of costs incurred in performing research and development activities personnel expenses  facility costs  contract services  license fees and milestone payments  costs of clinical trials  laboratory supplies and drug products  and allocations of corporate costs 
we expense all research and development activity costs in the period incurred

results of operations results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal in  we incurred a net loss of approximately million compared to a net loss of approximately million in the increase of million was primarily due to an increase of million in research and development expenses including approximately million in cash for the acquisition of an anticancer drug candidate spi and a decrease of million in licensing revenues from these increases in net loss were offset by the non recurrence in of a non cash charge in of million stock options expense  which charge arose due to timing delays in awarding stock options to employees as a result of our compliance with state securities laws during a period where our stock price rose rapidly 
we recorded  of revenues in and million revenues in the year ended december  the revenue in primarily represents  of product sales revenue  recorded from the first shipment of ciprofloxacin  after receipt of fda approval in september  and represents the cash received by us 
the cost of the product sold was  in view of the competitive market for sales of ciprofloxacin  we are unable to assess the future revenue potential of this product 
also  in we received  from gpc biotech under our co development license agreement  representing commissions on drug products used by gpc biotech in clinical trials 
in connection with the revenue from gpc  we had no performance obligations or incurred costs 
the timing and amount of similar revenues in the future is neither predictable nor assured 
the revenue in was derived from the second licensing fee of million under the licensing agreement with gpc  which became due in september upon dosing of the first patient in a registrational study 
future revenues from gpc are dependent upon the occurrence of milestones specified in the agreement 
no milestone event occurred during research and development expenses increased by  from  in to  in  primarily due to a cash payment of million for the up front licensing fee for spi  and a million increase in drug product expense as a result of the investigation and development of additional new products  and increased clinical trials activity for eoquin and elsamitrucin 
other notable increases in expenses over the comparative reporting period in  were personnel costs of  insurance costs of  and patent related legal expenses of  which were partially offset by a reduction in rent expense of  due to the termination of a lease on a research facility 
these cost increases are the result of the increasing scope of our activities  which include the investigation and development of new prescription drug candidates 
we expect continued increases in research and development expenses in and beyond as we develop and expand our product portfolio 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  from  in to  in  primarily due to legal and professional fees  excluding financing related fees charged against the proceeds of the financing  and sec reporting and compliance costs increased by approximately  in due primarily to the changes in our organization  compliance with new nasdaq  sec and sarbanes oxley act of rules and regulations  and evaluation of business alliances and opportunities in conjunction with expanding our product portfolio 
personnel costs  excluding the severance charge of approximately  increased by approximately  due to the hiring of additional personnel in the past twelve months to enable us to implement our planned growth 
partially offsetting the foregoing increased costs were reductions in rent expense primarily as a result of a more favorable facility lease effective july  stock based charges  which are non cash charges  decreased by approximately  from  in to  in the following describe the components of the charges in and  of the charge arose from recording the fair value of  shares of restricted common stock issued to zentaris gmbh in connection with the in licensing of spi the remainder of the relates to amortization of the fair value of warrants granted to consultants  primarily in and the charge arose due to timing delays in awarding stock options to employees as a result of our compliance with state securities laws during a period where our stock price rose rapidly 
we believe the use of stock options and similar equity based awards is crucial for an early stage company like ours  as a means to conserve cash and to retain and motivate high performance employees and consultants 
we believe that such equity awards foster an alignment of employee and consultant interests with those of our stockholders 
we expect stock based charges to become increasingly significant to us 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment 
the adoption of this statement will result in significantly higher reported operating expenses in our future financial statements 
had we adopted the provisions of statement no 
r as of january   our stock based charges for would have been  higher  or  we intend to adopt the provisions of statement no 
r when it becomes a mandatory requirement  currently expected to be july  other income  net for compared to increased by approximately  primarily due to interest income earned on significantly higher average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and rising short term interest rates during results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for of million decreased by approximately million as compared to  and was derived from the second licensing fee of million under the co development and licensing agreement with gpc biotech ag  which became due in september upon dosing of the first patient in a registrational study 
future gpc revenues are dependant upon the occurrence of milestones specified in the agreement 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately million  from million in to million in primarily as a result of the restructuring  initiated in august  whereby all research activities related to neotrofin tm  functional genomics and neurology were eliminated 
in  research and development expenses included our ongoing clinical trial for eoquin tm in the treatment of patients with refractory superficial bladder cancer  procurement of elsamitrucin supplies for a clinical trial in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma and expenses incurred in connection with the filing of our andas for ciprofloxacin  carboplatin and fluconazole 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  from million in to million in due primarily to the following factors legal and professional fees increased by approximately  in due to the changes in our organization  expenses incurred in successfully addressing the nasdaq delisting notice we received in march  additional expenses for compliance with california and other state securities laws due to our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  compliance with new sec and sarbanes oxley act rules and regulations  and evaluation of business alliances and opportunities in conjunction with expanding our product portfolio  employee severance costs included in general and administrative expense in of approximately  as a result of the change in our business plan  and a dramatic reduction in the scope of our research and development activities  the allocation of general and administrative costs to research and development was million lower in as compared to  and offsetting the foregoing increases was an aggregate decrease of approximately million in payroll and occupancy costs  depreciation and other miscellaneous corporate overhead 
stock based compensation expense of  for represents non cash charges as a result of stock awards and stock options granted to employees and consultants 
the use of options as a means to compensate and retain employees is crucial for a company like ours 
the increase of approximately million in stock based compensation from million in as compared to million in was primarily due to timing delays in in awarding stock options as a result of our compliance with state securities laws during a period where our stock price was rising rapidly 
stock awards and options granted to employees are accounted for under apb all of the options granted by us have been made at fair market values on the dates originally authorized by the board of directors or the compensation committee 
however  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  certain grants to employees contemplated by the board had later effective grant dates 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash stock based employee compensation expense of  during in accordance with sfas  we expense the fair value of options granted to consultants 
during  we agreed to issue to a consultant engaged to generate retail interest in our stock  a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the black scholes value of the warrant   is being amortized over the service period and  was charged to expense in during  approximately million of stock based compensation was charged in connection with the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in settlement of accounts payable to certain vendors 
in addition  during  we recorded compensation expense of  as a result of the amortization of deferred compensation costs which were recorded in and prior years  when we granted stock options to employees with exercise prices less than the fair value of our common stock at the measurement date 
the intrinsic values of the option grants were recorded as deferred compensation and were amortized to expense over the vesting period  in accordance with apb the restructuring charge of  in is related to an adjustment of the realizable value of assets held for sale as of december  other income for compared to increased approximately  due primarily to the elimination of miscellaneous expenses associated with the activities related to functional genomics and neurology

table of contents contractual and commercial obligations the following table summarizes our contractual and other commitments  including obligations under a facility lease and equipment leases  as of december  payment due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations contingent milestone obligations total the table of contractual and commercial obligations excludes contingent payments that we may become obligated to pay upon the occurrence of future events whose outcome is not readily predictable 
such significant contingent obligations are described below under employment agreements 
as of december   we had no capital lease obligations 
the operating lease obligations are substantially related to the facility lease for our corporate office  which extends through june purchase obligations represent the amount of open purchase orders and contractual commitments to vendors  for products and services that have not been delivered  or rendered  as of december  milestone obligations are payable contingent upon successfully reaching certain development and regulatory milestones as further described below under licensing agreements 
while the amounts included in the table above represent all of our potential cash milestone obligations as of december   given the unpredictability of the drug development process  and the impossibility of predicting the success of current and future clinical trials  the timelines estimated above do not represent a forecast of when payment milestones will actually be reached  if at all 
rather  they assume that all milestones under all of our license agreements are successfully met  and represent our best estimates of the timelines 
in the event that the milestones are met  we believe it is likely that the increase in the potential value of the related drug product will significantly exceed the amount of the milestone obligation 
licensing agreements each of our proprietary drug product candidates is being developed pursuant to license agreements  which provide us with exclusive territorial rights to  among other things  develop  sublicense  and sell the drug product candidates 
we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the drug product candidates  are generally responsible for all development  patent filing and maintenance costs  sales  marketing and liability insurance costs  and are contingently obligated to make milestone payments to the licensors if we successfully reach certain development and regulatory milestones 
in addition  we are obligated to pay royalties and sales milestones on net sales  if any  after marketing approval is obtained from regulatory authorities 
we have no similar milestone or other payment obligations in connection with our generic drug products 
the potential contingent cash milestone obligations  aggregating approximately million as of december   under all our licensing agreements are generally tied to progress through the fda approval process  which approval significantly depends on positive clinical trial results 
the following list is typical of milestone events commencement of phase clinical trials  filing of new drug applications in the united states  europe and japan  and the approvals from those regulatory agencies 

table of contents given the unpredictability of the drug development process  it is not possible to predict the probability of achieving successful results from the currently on going clinical trials 
we are  therefore  unable to predict the likelihood of any of the milestones occurring in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  the milestone payments represent contingent obligations  which will be recorded as expense when the milestone occurs 
if we reach a milestone  it will likely occur prior to revenues being generated from the related compound 
however  in connection with the milestone obligations related to one of our drug product candidates  satraplatin  each of our contingent future cash payment obligations is generally matched by a corresponding  greater payment milestone obligation of gpc biotech to us 
in addition  upon successful achievement of one of the development milestones for renazorb tm under our licensing agreement with altair nanotechnologies  which is anticipated to occur in  we will be obligated to issue altair  shares of our restricted common stock 
service agreements in connection with the research and development of our drug products  we have entered into contracts with numerous third party service providers  such as clinical trial centers  clinical research organizations  data monitoring centers  and with drug formulation  development and testing laboratories 
the financial terms of these agreements are varied and generally obligate us to pay in stages  depending on achievement of certain events  such as contract execution  reservation of service or production capacity  actual performance of service  or the successful accrual and dosing of patients 
as of each period end  we accrue for all non cancelable installment amounts that we are likely to become obligated to pay  and charge such accruals to research and development costs 
employment agreements we have entered into employment agreements with two of our executive officers  dr 
shrotriya  chief executive officer  and dr 
lenaz  chief scientific officer  expiring december  and july   respectively 
the employment agreements automatically renew for a one year term unless either party gives written notice at least days prior to the commencement of the next year of such party s intent not to renew the agreement 
the agreements require each executive to devote his full working time and effort to the business and affairs of the company during the term of the agreement 
the agreements provide for an annual base salary with annual increases  periodic bonuses and option grants as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors 
each officer s employment may be terminated by us with or without cause as defined in the agreement 
the agreements provide for certain guaranteed severance payments and benefits if the officer s employment is terminated without cause  if the officer s employment is terminated due to a change in control or is adversely affected due to a change in control and the officer resigns or if the officer decides to terminate his employment due to a disposition of a significant amount of assets or business units 
the guaranteed severance payment includes a payment equal to twice the officer s then current annual base salary 
in addition  all options held by the officer shall immediately vest and will be exercisable for one year from the date of termination  provided  however  if the board determines that the officer s employment is being terminated for the reason that the shared expectations of the officer and the board are not being met  in the board s judgment  then the options currently held by the officer will vest in accordance with their terms for up to one year after the date of termination  with the right to exercise those options  when they vest  for approximately thirteen months after the date of termination 
the agreements also provide that  upon his retirement  all options held by the officer will become fully vested 
related party transactions outsource arrangement between november and november  we had outsourced the administration  accounting and human resources functions  and sec report preparation to mcmanus financial consulting mfc for a monthly fee of  and all investor relations activities to mcmanus co 
m c for a monthly fee of 
table of contents  to  per month 
between january and june  mfc also provided services to us at hourly rates  subject to a minimum annual retainer of  during the years ended december   and  mfc and m c received total fees and payments under severance arrangements amounting to   and  respectively 
mfc and m c are co owned by two of our former officers  john and michael mcmanus  who are also brothers 
john mcmanus received direct compensation from the company as vice president finance and strategic planning and assistant corporate secretary  however  michael mcmanus received no direct compensation from us for his services as controller 
in november  john and michael mcmanus resigned their positions with the company to return to their consulting business to pursue other opportunities 
all payment obligations under these arrangements terminated in july director and officer notes for the exercise of equity instruments as of january   certain of our directors and officers owed us  previously loaned to them for the exercise of stock options or the purchase of stock 
during  we were repaid  which included all loans to officers 
in february  we agreed to forgive and terminate the remaining  and in return  the directors agreed to return the shares of common stock originally purchased under the loans 
for accounting purposes  this arrangement was considered to be an uncompleted transaction and therefore  the common stock and related notes receivable were eliminated as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and credit risk on our cash equivalents and marketable securities  which investments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we do not utilize hedging contracts or similar instruments 
our primary exposures relate to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio  and credit risk of the companies bonds in which we invest 
we manage interest rate risk on our investment portfolio by matching scheduled investment maturities with our cash requirements 
our investments as of december  are primarily in day auction rate notes 
because of our ability to redeem these investments at par within a day period  changes in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of these investments 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   any decline in the fair value of our investments would not be material 
in addition  we are exposed to certain market risks associated with credit ratings of corporations whose corporate bonds we have purchased 
if these companies were to experience a significant detrimental change in their credit ratings  the fair market value of such corporate bonds may significantly decrease 
if these companies were to default on these corporate bonds  we may lose part or all of our principal 
we believe that we effectively manage this market risk by diversifying our investments  and selecting securities that generally have third party insurance coverage in the event of default by the issuer
