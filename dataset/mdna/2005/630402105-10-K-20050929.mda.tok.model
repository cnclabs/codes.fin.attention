item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is a diversified manufacturer of security products  encompassing intrusion and fire alarms  building access control systems and electronic locking devices 
these products are used for commercial  residential  institutional  industrial and governmental applications  and are sold worldwide principally to independent distributors  dealers and installers of security equipment 
international sales accounted for approximately of our revenues for fiscal year the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in amityville  new york and the dominican republic 
a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed  and do not fluctuate with changes in customer demand or utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
as product demand rises and factory utilization increases  the fixed costs are spread over increased output  which should improve profit margins 
conversely  when sales decline our fixed costs are spread over reduced levels  thereby decreasing margins 
in february the company entered into a joint venture with an unrelated company to sell security related products  including those manufactured by the company  in the middle east 
the company owns of the newly formed company  an llc organized in new york  which has its main operations in the united arab emirates 
to date  revenues generated by this joint venture have been immaterial 
the security market is characterized by constant incremental innovation in product design and manufacturing technologies 
generally  the company devotes of revenues to research and development r d on an annual basis 
products resulting from our r d investments in fiscal did not contribute materially to revenue during this fiscal year  but should benefit the company over future years 
in general  the new products introduced by the company are initially shipped in limited quantities  and increase over time 
prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as products and technologies mature 
economic and other factors the post september era has generally been characterized by a favorable business climate for suppliers of electronic security products and services versus the rather sluggish performance of most technology related sectors during the similar period 
electronic security vendors  however  did not completely escape the fallout from the broader downturn in capital spending in the economy 
the company believes the security equipment market is likely to continue to exhibit healthy growth  particularly in industrial sectors  due to ongoing concerns over the adequacy of security safeguards 
seasonality the company s fiscal year begins on july and ends on june historically  the end users of napco s products want to install its products prior to the summer  therefore sales of its products peak in the period april through june  the company s fiscal fourth quarter  and are reduced in the period july through september  the company s fiscal first quarter 
to a lesser degree  sales in europe are also adversely impacted in the company s first fiscal quarter because of european vacation patterns  ie  many distributors and installers are closed for the month of august 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  concentration of credit risk  inventory  goodwill  and income taxes 
revenue recognition revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped or delivered to the customer pursuant to the terms of purchase 
we report our sales levels on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns and allowances 
our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales and income 
this accrual is calculated based on a history of gross sales and actual sales returns  as well as management s estimate of anticipated returns and allowances 
as a percentage of gross sales  sales returns and allowances were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
concentration of credit risk an entity is more vulnerable to concentrations of credit risk if it is exposed to risk of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risk through diversification of customers 
such risks of loss manifest themselves differently  depending on the nature of the concentration  and vary in significance 
the company had two customers customer a and b with accounts receivable balances that aggregated and of the company s accounts receivable at june  and  respectively 
sales to neither of these customers exceeded of net sales in any of the past three years 
in the ordinary course of business  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of  and  as of june  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings 
this allowance is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable agings  specific exposures and historical trends 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale 
the reported net value of our inventory includes finished saleable products  work in process and raw materials that will be sold or used in future periods 
inventory cost includes raw materials  direct labor and overhead 
we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve  which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based on various product sales projections 
this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age  historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales 
in addition  and as necessary  we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 
goodwill effective july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements established accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
specifically  the standards address how acquired intangible assets should be accounted for both at the time of acquisition and after they have been recognized in the financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 intangible assets  including purchased goodwill  must be evaluated for impairment 
those intangible assets that are classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized 
impairment testing is performed in two steps i the company determines impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  and ii if there is an impairment  the company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the company has performed its annual impairment evaluation required by this standard and determined that the goodwill is not impaired 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts reflected for financial reporting and tax purposes 
net deferred tax assets are adjusted by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if the company determines that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable or that a previously reserved deferred tax asset will become realizable  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of  or increase to  earnings at that time 
the provision benefit for income taxes represents us federal  state and foreign taxes 
through june   the company s subsidiary in the dominican republic  napco alarm lock group international  sa napco dr  was not subject to tax in the united states  as a result  no taxes were provided 
effective july   the company made a domestication election for napco dr 
accordingly  its income is subject to taxation in the united states on a going forward basis 
in march  napco security systems  inc timely filed its income tax return for the fiscal year ended june  this return included an election to treat one of the company s foreign subsidiaries  napco dr  as if it were a domestic corporation beginning july  this election was based on a then recently enacted internal revenue code code provision 
as a result of this election  napco dr is treated  for federal income tax purposes  as transferring all of its assets to a domestic corporation in connection with an exchange 
although this type of transfer usually results in the recognition of taxable income to the extent of any untaxed earnings and profits  the code provision provides an exemption for applicable corporations 
the company qualifies as an applicable corporation pursuant to this code section  and based on this code exemption  the company treated the transfer of approximately  of napco dr s untaxed earnings and profits as nontaxable 
the internal revenue service has issued a revenue procedure which is inconsistent with the code exemption described above 
the code is the actual law  a revenue procedure is the irs s interpretation of the law 
the code has a higher level of authority than a revenue procedure 
management believes that it has appropriately relied on the guidance in the code when filing its income tax return 
if challenged  the company believes that the potential liability would range from to  however  the company also believes there are other mitigating factors that would limit the amount of the potential liability  and as a result  management accrued a liability of  as of june  the company s tax provision utilizes estimates made by management and as such  is subject to change as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash on hand combined with proceeds from operating activities during fiscal were adequate to meet the company s capital expenditure needs and short and long term debt obligations 
the company s primary internal source of liquidity is the cash flow generated from operations 
the primary source of financing related to borrowings under a  secured revolving credit facility 
the company expects that cash generated from operations and cash available under the company s bank line of credit will be adequate to meet its short term liquidity requirements 
as of june   the company s unused sources of funds consisted principally of  in cash and approximately  which represents the unused portion of its secured revolving credit facility 
the company s management believes that current working capital  cash flows from operations and its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to fund the company s operations through at least the first quarter of fiscal in may  the company amended its secured revolving credit agreement with its primary bank 
the company s borrowing capacity under the amended agreement was increased to  the amended revolving credit agreement is secured by all the accounts receivable  inventory and certain other assets of napco security systems  inc  a first and second mortgage on the company s headquarters in amityville  new york and common stock of three of the company s subsidiaries 
the revolving credit agreement bears interest at either the prime rate less or an alternate rate based on libor as described in the agreement 
the revolving credit agreement  which previously had an expiration date of july  has been extended to september any outstanding borrowings must be repaid or refinanced on or before that time 
the agreement contains various restrictions and covenants including  among others  restrictions on payment of cash dividends  restrictions on borrowings  restrictions on capital expenditures  the maintenance of minimum amounts of tangible net worth  and compliance with other certain financial ratios  as defined in the agreement 
as of june   the company was not in compliance with one of these covenants for which it has received the appropriate waiver from its bank 
in december the company utilized a portion of this facility to accelerate full repayment of its and term loans described below 
in january  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock from two shareholders  unaffiliated with the company  at per share  a discount from its then current trading price of

the company financed the transaction with borrowings under a month installment loan of  continental designs and sells access control and other security control systems to dealers and distributors worldwide 
the company repaid the loan in full in december working capital 
working capital increased by  to  at june  from  at june  the increase in working capital was primarily the result of the increase in net income as partially offset by debt reduction and an increase in accounts receivable and inventory 
working capital is calculated by deducting current liabilities from current assets

forward looking information this annual report on form k and the information incorporated by reference may include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act of the company intends the forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements 
all statements regarding the company s expected financial position and operating results  its business strategy  its financing plans and the outcome of any contingencies are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are based on current estimates and projections about our industry and our business 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth or implied by any forward looking statements 
for example  the company is highly dependent on its chief executive officer for strategic planning 
if he is unable to perform his services for any significant period of time  the company s ability to continue growing could be adversely affected 
in addition  factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  adverse tax consequences of offshore operations  distribution problems  unforeseen environmental liabilities and the uncertain military  political and economic conditions in the world 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal financial instrument is long term debt consisting of a revolving credit and term loan facility that provides for interest at a spread below the prime rate 
the company is affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by the company under this credit facility 
at june   an aggregate principal amount of approximately  was outstanding under the company s credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
if principal amounts outstanding under the company s credit facility remained at this year end level for an entire year and the prime rate increased or decreased  respectively  by the company would pay or save  respectively  an additional  in interest that year 
where appropriate  the company requires that letters of credit be provided on foreign sales 
in addition  a significant number of transactions by the company are denominated in us dollars 
as such  the company has shifted foreign currency exposure onto many of its foreign customers 
as a result  if exchange rates move against foreign customers  the company could experience difficulty collecting unsecured accounts receivable  the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders 
the foregoing could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company transacts certain sales in europe in british pounds sterling  therefore exposing itself to a certain amount of foreign currency risk 
management believes that the amount of this exposure is immaterial 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risk relative to the dominican peso rd  the local currency of the company s production facility in the dominican republic 
the result of a strengthening in the us dollar to our rd expenses would result in an annual decrease in income from operations of approximately
