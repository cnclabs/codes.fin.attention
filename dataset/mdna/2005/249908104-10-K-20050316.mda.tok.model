item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
collaborative relationships biovail laboratories incorporated 
in may  we entered into an agreement granting biovail an exclusive license in the united states and canada to manufacture and market metformin gr 
under the terms of the agreement  we are responsible for funding and completing the clinical development program and some related regulatory activities in support of metformin gr 
the agreement provides for a million milestone payment to us upon fda approval of the product and further provides for royalties on net sales of metformin gr 
biovail has an option to reduce certain of the royalties for a one time payment to us of million 
in april  we and biovail amended the metformin gr licensing agreement 
under the amended agreement  we will receive royalties on sales of biovail s mg metformin hc tablet in the united states and canada in exchange for allowing biovail to use our clinical data for metformin gr  our mg metformin hc tablet  to support and accelerate regulatory submissions for biovail s mg tablet and to establish equivalence between the two dosage forms 
the nda filed by biovail was for approval of both metformin gr and biovail s mg metformin hcl tablet under the brand name of glumetza 
in february  biovail received an approvable letter from the fda requiring certain additional steps be taken prior to approval of the drug 
the earliest that we expect to obtain fda approval to market glumetza is in the second quarter of  if at all 
lg life sciences  ltd 
in august  we entered into a license and distribution agreement granting lg life sciences an exclusive license to glumetza mg in the republic of korea 
the agreement provides for a  upfront license fee   milestone fee upon approval in korea and royalties on net sales of glumetza mg 
the upfront license fee will be amortized over a period of eight years  which represents the estimated length of time that we are obligated to provide assistance in development and manufacturing 
for the year ended december   we recognized  or of our total revenue for the year 
activbiotics  inc in october  we signed an agreement with activbiotics  inc to conduct feasibility studies to develop an extended release oral tablet to deliver activbiotics broad spectrum antibiotic  rifalazil  to the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract 
in january  we completed the preclinical feasibility studies with a gr formulation of rifalazil 
in june  we gave notice of termination of our agreement with activbiotics 
for the years ended december   and revenues received for work performed for activbiotics were   and  respectively or  and of our total revenues  respectively 
avi biopharma  inc in june  we entered into a joint collaboration to investigate the feasibility of controlled oral delivery of avi s proprietary neugene antisense agents 
the purpose of the collaboration is to study the feasibility of oral drug formulations based on our gr system 
we have developed candidate dosage forms incorporating one of avi s antisense agents and preclinical testing is underway 
the indication for this product has not been disclosed 
no revenues have been received under this agreement 
other collaborative partner 
in june  we signed an agreement with an undisclosed collaborative partner to conduct feasibility studies for the partner 
we recognized revenue of approximately  and  or and  of our revenues in and  respectively  which approximated the costs recognized under the agreement 
we do not expect to perform additional product development services under this agreement 
competition other companies that have oral drug delivery technologies competitive with the gr system include bristol myers squibb  ivax corporation  alza corporation a subsidiary of johnson johnson  skyepharma plc  biovail corporation  flamel technologies sa  ranbaxy laboratories  ltd  kos pharmaceuticals  inc  xenoport  inc  intec pharma and alpharma  inc  all of which develop oral tablet products designed to release the incorporated drugs over time 
each of these companies has patented technologies with attributes different from ours  and in some cases with different sites of delivery to the gastrointestinal tract 
bristol myers squibb is currently marketing a sustained release formulation of metformin  glucophage xr  with which glumetza will compete 
the limited license that bristol myers squibb obtained from us under our november settlement agreement extends to certain current and internally developed future compounds  which may increase the likelihood that we will face competition from bristol myers squibb in the future on products in addition to glumetza 
ivax corporation  par pharmaceutical  inc and alpharma  inc 
have received fda approval for and are selling a controlled release metformin product 
flamel technologies has a controlled release metformin product in clinical trials 
bayer corporation is currently marketing a once daily ciprofloxacin product for the treatment of urinary tract infections 
there may be other companies developing products competitive with glumetza and proquin of which we are unaware 
to our knowledge  we are the only company currently developing a sustained release formulation of gabapentin for the united states market 
the competitive situation with respect to gabapentin gr is complex and uncertain given the current regulatory and intellectual property status of gabapentin  which is currently marketed by pfizer as neurontin for adjunctive therapy for epileptic seizures and for postherpetic pain 
pfizer s basic united states patents relating to neurontin have expired  and at least seven companies are seeking or have received fda approval for immediate release formulations of the drug 
however  pfizer has initiated several lawsuits against companies seeking to market formulations of gabapentin that compete with neurontin  claiming that these formulations of gabapentin infringe pfizer s patents 
in addition  pfizer has developed a new product  lyrica pregabalin  which will be marketed as an improved version of neurontin 
it received fda approval in december to our knowledge  we are the only company currently developing a sustained release formulation of furosemide for the united states market  but other companies have published research data indicating that products may be developed that are competitive with furosemide gr 
competition in pharmaceutical products and drug delivery systems is intense 
we expect competition to increase 
competing technologies or products developed in the future may prove superior to the gr system or products using the gr system  either generally or in particular market segments 
these developments could make the gr system or products using the gr system noncompetitive or obsolete 
most of our principal competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and research and development resources than we do 
in addition  many of our potential collaborative partners have devoted  and continue to devote  significant resources to the development of their own drug delivery systems and technologies 
patents and proprietary rights our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies and to preserve our trade secrets 
our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights  by among other methods  filing patent applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology 
we currently hold nine issued united states patents and twelve united states patent applications are pending 
in addition  we are preparing patent applications relating to our expanding technology for filing in the united states and abroad 
we have also applied for patents in numerous foreign countries 
some of those countries have granted our applications and other applications are still pending 
our pending patent applications may lack priority over others applications or may not result in the issuance of patents 
even if issued  our patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide protection against competitors with similar technologies and may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or may not provide us with competitive advantages against competing products 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  which are difficult to protect 
we seek to protect such information  in part  through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  collaborative partners and others before such persons or entities have access to our proprietary trade secrets and know how 
these confidentiality agreements may not be effective in certain cases  due to  among other things  the lack of an adequate remedy for breach of an agreement or a finding that an agreement is unenforceable 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
our ability to develop our technologies and to make commercial sales of products using our technologies also depends on not infringing others patents or other intellectual property rights 
we are not aware of any intellectual property claims against us 
however  the pharmaceutical industry has experienced extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
for example  pfizer has initiated several suits against companies seeking to market formulations of gabapentin that compete with neurontin  claiming that these formulations of gabapentin infringe pfizer s patents 
the results of this litigation could adversely impact our ability to commercialize gabapentin gr 
also  we are aware that patents issued to third parties relating to sustained release drug formulations or particular pharmaceutical compounds could in the future be asserted against us  although we believe that we do not infringe any valid claim of any patents 
if claims concerning any of our products were to arise and it was determined that these products infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be subject to substantial damages for past infringement or be forced to stop or delay our activities with respect to any infringing product  unless we can obtain a license or we may have to redesign our product so that it does not infringe upon others patent rights  which may not be possible or could require substantial funds or time 
such a license may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if we  our collaborators or our licensors were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
in addition  any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us  even if such claims are without merit  could cause our stock price to decline 
from time to time  we may become aware of activities by third parties that may infringe our patents 
infringement by others of our patents may reduce our market shares if a related product is approved and  consequently  our potential future revenues and adversely affect our patent rights if we do not take appropriate enforcement action 
we may need to engage in litigation in the future to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
our issued or licensed patents may not be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction 
whether or not the outcome of litigation is favorable to us  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 
we may also be required to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office for the purpose of determining the priority of inventions in connection with our patent applications or other parties patent applications 
adverse determinations in litigation or interference proceedings could require us to seek licenses which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or subject us to significant liabilities to third parties 
if we need but cannot obtain a license  we may be prevented from marketing the affected product 
manufacturing  marketing and sales although we have established internal manufacturing facilities to manufacture supplies for our phase i and phase ii clinical trials  we do not have  and we do not intend to establish in the foreseeable future  internal commercial scale manufacturing capabilities 
rather  we intend to use the facilities of third parties to manufacture products for phase iii clinical trials and commercialization 
our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of products using the gr system may adversely affect our ability to deliver such products on a timely or competitive basis 
although biovail has made arrangements for the third party manufacture of glumetza  there may not be sufficient manufacturing capacity available to us when  if ever  we are ready to seek commercial sales of other products using the gr system 
the manufacturing processes of our third party manufacturers may be found to violate the proprietary rights of others 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays and difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers  the market introduction and commercial sales of our products will be delayed  and our revenue will suffer 
applicable current good manufacturing practices cgmp requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities will apply to the manufacture of products using the gr system 
we will depend on the manufacturers of products using the gr system to comply with cgmp and applicable foreign standards 
any failure by a manufacturer of products using the gr system to maintain cgmp or comply with applicable foreign standards could delay or prevent their initial or continued commercial sale 
in  we announced our determination to evolve from a solely product development focused company to an integrated organization with sales and marketing of our own products 
while preliminary staffing for these activities will begin in  we anticipate this process will continue over the next several years 
government regulation numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries regulate our research and development activities and those of our collaborative partners 
governmental approval is required of all potential pharmaceutical products using the gr system and the manufacture and marketing of products using the gr system prior to the commercial use of those products 
the regulatory process will take several years and require substantial funds 
if products using the gr system do not receive the required regulatory approvals or if such approvals are delayed  our business would be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the requisite regulatory approvals will be obtained without lengthy delays  if at all 
in the united states  the fda rigorously regulates pharmaceutical products  including any drugs using the gr system 
if a company fails to comply with applicable requirements  the fda or the courts may impose sanctions 
these sanctions may include civil penalties  criminal prosecution of the company or its officers and employees  injunctions  product seizure or detention  product recalls  total or partial suspension of production 
the fda may withdraw approved applications or refuse to approve pending new drug applications  premarket approval applications  or supplements to approved applications 
we generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings 
these studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product 
we then submit the results of these studies to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  which must become effective before beginning clinical testing in humans 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process in phase i  we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug s early safety profile and its pharmacokinetic pattern 
in phase ii  we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and further evidence of safety 
in phase iii  we conduct large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda prior to commercialization 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
the results of the preclinical and clinical testing are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application nda for approval prior to commercialization 
an nda requires that our products are compliant with cgmp 
failure to achieve or maintain cgmp standards for products using the gr system would adversely impact their marketability 
in responding to an nda  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application 
failure to receive approval for any products using the gr system would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the fda regulates not only prescription and over the counter drugs approved by ndas  but also over the counter products that comply with monographs issued by the fda 
these regulations include cgmp requirements  general and specific over the counter labeling requirements including warning statements  advertising restrictions  and requirements regarding the safety and suitability of inactive ingredients 
in addition  the fda may inspect over the counter products and manufacturing facilities 
a failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may lead to administrative or judicially imposed penalties 
if an over the counter product differs from the terms of a monograph  it will  in most cases  require fda approval of an nda for the product to be marketed 
foreign regulatory approval of a product must also be obtained prior to marketing the product internationally 
foreign approval procedures vary from country to country 
the time required for approval may delay or prevent marketing in certain countries 
in certain instances we or our collaborative partners may seek approval to market and sell certain products outside of the united states before submitting an application for united states approval to the fda 
the clinical testing requirements and the time required to obtain foreign regulatory approvals may differ from that required for fda approval 
although there is now a centralized european union eu approval mechanism in place  each eu country may nonetheless impose its own procedures and requirements 
many of these procedures and requirements are time consuming and expensive 
some eu countries require price approval as part of the regulatory process 
these constraints can cause substantial delays in obtaining required approval from both the fda and foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed  and approval in any single country may not meaningfully indicate that another country will approve the product 
product liability our business involves exposure to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the production and manufacture of pharmaceutical products 
we have obtained product liability insurance for clinical trials currently underway  but we may not be able to obtain product liability insurance for future trials  we may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms  we may not be able to secure increased coverage as the commercialization of the gr system proceeds  or our insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products 
defending a lawsuit would be costly and significantly divert management s attention from conducting our business 
if third parties were to bring a successful product liability claim or series of claims against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liability limits  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
none of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced any work stoppage 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
our success is dependent in large part upon the continued services of john w 
fara  phd  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other members of our executive management team  and on our ability to attract and retain key management and operating personnel 
we do not have agreements with dr 
fara or any of our other executive officers that provide for their continued employment with us 
management  scientific and operating personnel are in high demand in our industry and are often subject to competing offers 
the loss of the services of one or more members of management or key employees or the inability to hire additional personnel as needed could result in delays in the research  development and commercialization of our potential product candidates

item properties in february  we entered into a five year non cancelable lease of approximately  square feet of laboratory and office facilities in menlo park  california 
in may  we renegotiated certain terms of our lease agreement including the lease term  which will now expire in april with an option to extend the lease for an additional five years 
we also entered into a non cancelable lease agreement to lease a  square foot facility adjacent to our existing facility in menlo park 
this agreement also expires in april with an option to extend the lease for an additional five years 
we expect that these facilities will accommodate our growth for the next one to two years

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  we made substantial progress towards commercialization of our first products 
because of our development and regulatory activities during the year  we are now poised for fda approvals of our two lead products glumetza  our extended release metformin formulation for treatment of type ii diabetes and proquin  our extended release formulation of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin 
in addition over the course of  we advanced other products in our pipeline 
highlights for the year include positive phase iii proquin results submission of new drug application and new drug submission seeking approval of glumetza mg in the us and canada  submission of new drug application seeking approval of proquin in the us  establishment of collaboration with lg life sciences to develop and market glumetza mg in korea  and reported preliminary phase ii results for furosemide gr 
recent developments in include sold  shares of our common stock in a registered direct public offering for per share with net proceeds of approximately  and received approvable letter from the fda for glumetza 
in  we reported a net loss of million or per share  compared to a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  cash and investment balances at december  were million 
revenues for the year ended december  totaled approximately  compared with  for the year ended december  revenues from collaborative agreements decrease to  in from  in as a result of decreased development services provided for two collaborative partners 
revenue from licensing agreements increased to  due to an agreement signed in august with lg life sciences to market glumetza mg in the republic of korea 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreased external expenses such as clinical and manufacturing expenses for our glumetza mg and proquin 
we have four products in clinical testing or submitted to the fda for approval 
the current status of each is described in part i  item critical accounting policies and estimates a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and the impact and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and use of estimates to be critical policies 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue related to collaborative research agreements with corporate partners is recognized as the expenses are incurred for each contract 
we are required to perform research activities as specified in each respective agreement on a best efforts basis  and we are reimbursed based on the costs associated with supplies  other outsourced activities and the hours worked by employees on each specific contract 
our business strategy includes performing additional development work for our partners  which we expect will include milestone payments and license fees 
we will recognize nonrefundable milestone payments pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of specified milestones where no further obligation to perform exists under that provision of the arrangement 
license fees are recognized over the period of continuing involvement of a specific contract or  if no continuing involvement exists  such license fees are recognized upon receipt 
management has made assumptions relating to the period of continuing involvement  which are subject to change 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the amount of revenues from licenses recorded in any given period 
accrued liabilities we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities  including clinical trials  preclinical studies and other external development activities 
some of the accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
if possible  we obtain information regarding the unbilled services directly from the service provider 
however  we may be required to estimate these services based on information available to our product development staff 
if we underestimate the research activity associated with a study at a given point in time  it would result in understated research and development expense in the period presented and overstated research and development expense in subsequent periods 
stock based compensation the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes to the subjective impute assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models to not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we are currently evaluating our option valuation methodologies and assumptions in lights of evolving accounting standards related to employee stock options 
change in accounting principle in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  which requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by a company if that company absorbs a majority of the vie s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the vie 
prior to the adoption of fin  vies were generally consolidated only by companies owning a majority voting interest in the vie 
we adopted fin on july   and consolidated ddl  as of that date  as we determined that ddl was a vie  as defined by fin  and that we determined that we absorbed a majority of its expected losses 
accordingly  we were required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of ddl on july  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
also  as we had been responsible for of ddl s losses under the terms of our agreements with elan  we had been recognizing of ddl s losses under the equity method of accounting prior to july  since the inception of ddl through june   we had recognized approximately million  or of ddl s expenses 
upon the adoption of fin  we calculated what the impact would have been on our operations had we consolidated of ddl s expenses and recorded an offsetting noncontrolling interest equal to of ddl s expenses the amounts funded by elan under the arrangement for the period from ddl s inception through june   or million  and determined that there was no cumulative catch up charge to record upon the adoption of fin our results of operations include of the operating results of ddl for the six months ended december  the noncontrolling interest for the period was not material  and it has been included as an offset to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
as ddl does not have any revenue  its accounts are reflected entirely in our consolidated operating expenses 
in september  we modified our agreements with elan that govern the terms of the joint venture and as a result of such modifications  we became responsible for of the funding requirements of ddl 
accordingly  we did not allocate any portion of ddl s results of operations to the noncontrolling interest 
in june  ddl became our wholly owned subsidiary when we acquired elan s interest in ddl 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues revenues for the years ended december   and were approximately   and  respectively 
in  revenues consisted of  recognized under a collaboration with activbiotics and another collaborative partner 
we completed product development services for both partners and we do not expect to perform additional product development services for these partners under the respective agreements 
other revenues in included  recorded under a licensing agreement signed with lg life sciences in august in  revenues consisted of  recognized under our collaboration with activbiotics and  from small collaborations with undisclosed partners 
in  revenues consisted of  earned for development work performed for ddl and  recognized under the activbiotics collaboration and several small collaborations with undisclosed partners 
research and development expense research and development expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of  in was primarily due to a decrease of  in external research and development expenses  including activities to complete clinical trials and reports for glumetza and proquin in the fourth quarter of  which were partially offset by  in expense related to the hiring of additional personnel to support the fda filings and analytical testing of our product candidates 
the increase of  in was due primarily to  of expense related to the hiring of additional personnel to support the fda filings and analytical testing for glumetza and proquin 
other increases were  in internal research and development as a result of our internal manufacturing and testing of clinical materials for our phase i and ii clinical trials 
rent expense also increased  due to the additional space we leased in may these increases were partially offset by decreased expense of  for external research and development expense  including manufacturing expense due to the completion in of manufacturing of clinical trial supplies or drugs for our glumetza and proquin phase iii trials 
we believe that our research and development expenses will remain relatively flat or increase moderately during  compared to  as we advance our other product candidates into later stage clinical development 
our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  outsourced clinical and other research activities  consultants  depreciation  facilities and utilities 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses cannot be predicted at this time for our product candidates in research and in development as it is not possible to determine the nature  timing and extent of clinical trials and studies  the fda s requirements for a particular drug and the requirements and level of participation  if any  by potential partners 
as potential products proceed through the development process  each step is typically more extensive  and therefore more expensive  than the previous step 
success in development therefore results  generally  in increasing expenditures 
furthermore  our business strategy involves licensing certain of our drug candidates to collaborative partners 
depending upon when such collaborative arrangements are executed  the amount of costs incurred solely by us will be impacted 
our largest cumulative research and development expense over the last three years has been related to the development of glumetza and proquin 
in  and  glumetza  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total research and development costs for that year 
in  and  proquin accounted for  and  respectively  of our research and development cost for that year 
in  gabapentin gr accounted for approximately of our research and development expense 
since glumetza has been licensed to biovail and submitted to the fda for approval  we can be reasonably certain of our remaining development and regulatory responsibilities and the associated expenses 
therefore  we are able to estimate that  as of december  the costs to complete our activities related to glumetza will not exceed  including costs for regulatory management  analytical testing and support 
based on the uncertainty of future events related to proquin  such costs cannot be predicted at this time 
we have incurred research and development expenses of approximately million in and none in and  related to conducting research and development activities on behalf of our former joint venture  ddl 
as of august  ddl has terminated all product development activities and ddl will not perform any future product development 
in june  we acquired our partner s interest in ddl 
we will not incur any additional associated expenses and no additional associated revenues will be earned related to research services performed on behalf of ddl 
our research and development activities can be divided into preclinical stage programs  which include analytical testing  process development  pilot scale production and preclinical testing  and later stage programs  which include clinical testing  regulatory affairs and manufacturing clinical supplies 
the costs associated with these programs approximate the following preclinical programs later stage programs our research and development activities can be divided into those related to our internal projects and those related to collaboration arrangements 
the costs related to internal projects versus collaboration arrangements approximate the following internal projects collaborative arrangements funded by partners collaborative arrangements not funded by partners the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives and the related stages of development for each product in development 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion date of current phase contains forward looking statements regarding timing of completion of product development phases 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see additional factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to the products listed below  from time to time we may enter into feasibility studies with collaborative partners that  if successful  may be followed by definitive agreements to advance development of the product

we expect that the pharmaceutical products that we develop internally will take  on average  from four to eight years to research  develop and obtain fda approval in the united states 
we generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings 
these studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product 
we then submit the results of these studies to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application or ind which  if successful  allows the opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process in phase i  we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug s early safety profile and its blood concentration profile over time 
a phase i trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase ii  we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and further evidence of safety 
a phase ii trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase iii  we conduct large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda prior to commercialization of the product 
a phase iii trial for our average potential product may take to years to plan and complete 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have two products that have completed phase iii 
the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and record keeping for each product 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulation  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of  in compared to was due to  in legal and accounting expense   in increased salaries and  in consulting expense 
legal  accounting and consulting expense increases resulted primarily from increased costs related to our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of salary expense increased due to increased salaries and the hiring of additional employees  including our director of corporate communications 
the decrease in compared to was due to a decrease of  in legal expense resulting from the settlement of our lawsuit with bristol myers squibb in november the decrease in was partially offset by an increase of  related to increased salaries and the hiring of a vice president of business development in december  a newly created position at that time 
other increases in included  for increased insurance rates and  in listing fees related to our move to the nasdaq national market from the american stock exchange in december in  we expect general and administrative expense will increase over levels as we begin building our sales and marketing capabilities to promote our product candidates 
we anticipate this process will evolve over the next several years

in august  all research and development work for ddl ceased 
we expect ddl will recognize annual general and administrative expense of approximately  related to legal fees 
for the period from inception january  to december   ddl recognized a net loss of approximately  this net loss includes a  payment by ddl to elan for the acquisition of in process research and development rights related to certain elan drug delivery technologies 
to date  ddl has not recognized any revenue 
elan made available to us a convertible loan facility to assist us in funding our portion of ddl s losses up to a principal maximum of  the funding term of the loan expired in september see contractual obligations below for additional information on this loan facility 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was approximately  for the year ended december  compared to interest expense of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in and  interest expense increased year over year due to compounding of accrued interest on the elan convertible loan facility 
in  the increase was also due to million in final loan draws which increased the elan loan balance in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   interest and other income increased to  from  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the increase was due to our increased investment balances as a result of our public offering in the fourth quarter of in  the increase was due to our increased investment balances as a result of our april private placement and our public offering in the fourth quarter of which was partially offset by decreasing average interest rates earned in compared to net interest income also includes insignificant losses and gains realized on the sale of certain of our marketable securities prior to the maturities of such instruments 
income taxes income tax expense for the year ended december  was  and none in prior periods 
the tax was paid to the republic of korea on a license fee we received from lg life sciences  ltd  a korean company 
all revenue received from lg life sciences will require income tax payment to the republic of korea 
we have not generated any federal or state taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately million 
future utilization of carryforwards may be limited in any fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized and federal research and development tax credits of approximately million which expire at various dates beginning in through our net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes were approximately million which expire at various dates beginning in through and state research and development tax credits of approximately million which have no expiration date 
as a result of the annual limitation  anticipated and future losses or changes in ownership of the company  all or a portion of these carryforwards may expire before becoming available to reduce our federal and state income tax liabilities 
gain from bristol myers legal settlement in january  we filed a complaint against bristol myers squibb in the united states district court for the northern district of california for infringement of our us patent no 
 in november  we signed a definitive settlement agreement and release with bristol myers squibb related to the litigation 
under the terms of the agreement  bristol myers squibb made a one time payment of million to us 
we and bristol myers squibb released all claims in the lawsuit against each other and granted each other a limited non exclusive royalty free license 
the license that bristol myers squibb obtained from us extends to certain current and future compounds that bristol myers may develop internally 
series a preferred stock and dividends in january  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock at a price of  per share to fund our share of the initial capitalization of ddl 
the series a preferred stock accrues a dividend of per annum  compounded semi annually and payable in shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock and dividends are convertible at anytime into our common stock 
the original conversion price of the series a preferred stock was 
however  as a result of our march and october financing  the conversion price has been adjusted to per share 
in december  we entered into an agreement with the series a preferred stockholder to resolve a misunderstanding between us and the stockholder relating primarily to prior adjustments to the conversion price of the series a preferred stock the december agreement 
pursuant to the december agreement  among other matters  we agreed to adjust the conversion price to per share 
we and the stockholder also agreed to binding interpretations of certain other terms related to the series a conversion price 
prior to december  the amounts calculated as series a preferred stock dividends were accounted for as an adjustment to the conversion price following eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios issue no 

as a result of the december agreement  we determined that a significant modification of the preferred stock agreement had occurred  and  therefore  a new commitment date was established for the series a preferred stock 
further  we determined that the fair value of the modified preferred stock was below the carrying value of such securities as of the date of the modification  therefore  no deemed dividend resulted from this modification 
also  we determined that although a new commitment date had been established  this change did not result in a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to emerging issues task force issue no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments 
in conjunction with the series a preferred stockholder agreement  we issued a warrant to the series a preferred stockholder 
the warrant is exercisable for shares of our common stock during the period between january and january the exercise price of the warrant initially will be equal to the series a preferred stock conversion in effect as of january  the exercise price of the warrant will decrease by approximately per year during the exercise period  such that the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant will increase by approximately per year 
the exercise of the warrant will be satisfied only by surrender of outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
stock based compensation expense in december  our board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under our stock option plan the plan by  shares 
on may   at the annual meeting of shareholders  our shareholders approved the increase to the plan 
in december and march  we granted options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock out of the  share increase of common stock at exercise prices of and  respectively  which represented the fair market values of our common stock on the respective dates of grant 
however  as the options were not deemed authorized for grant until the shareholders approved the increase in the number of shares authorized under the plan  the applicable measurement date for accounting purposes was on the date such approval was obtained 
since the fair market value of the underlying common stock on may  was  which was greater than the exercise prices of the stock options granted  we were required to record the difference of approximately  as deferred stock based compensation expense to be recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related stock options 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately  in stock based compensation expense related to the stock options 
we expect to recognize approximately  in stock based compensation expense related to these stock options per quarter through the second quarter of in december  our board of directors approved a stock option which was subject to the optionee s acceptance of employment which occurred in february since the fair market value of the underlying common stock was greater on the date of the optionee s employment than on the grant date  we were required to record the difference of approximately  as deferred stock based compensation expense to be recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related stock option 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately  in stock based compensation related to this stock option 
we expect to recognize approximately  per quarter through the first quarter of related to this stock option 
in july  our board of directors approved an amendment to all stock options granted to non employee members of our board of directors 
in the case of the death of a non employee director  the amendment provides for the director s beneficiary to exercise the director s stock options at anytime over the remaining life of the stock option 
a non cash compensation expense related to the amended stock options will be recognized if and when a director s beneficiary benefits from this modified provision 
the maximum stock based compensation expense would be  if all non employee directors benefit from this provision with respect to outstanding options 
to date  no expense has been recognized related to these options

operating activities cash used in operations in the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the change in cash used in operations was due primarily to the net loss and partially offset by adjustments for non cash items and an increase in deferred revenue from the lg life sciences license agreement signed in august in  the change in cash used in operations was due primarily to the net loss and decreases in accounts payable due to decreased clinical trial activity by the end of in  the change in cash used in operations was due primarily to our net loss partially offset by our share of the loss of the joint venture a non cash charge in operating activities and increases in accounts payable due to increased clinical trials activity

the funding term of the loan expired on september  the loan and accrued interest are payable in january in cash or shares of our common stock at the rate of per share  with the form of payment at elan s option 
through december   we have invested approximately  in equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements  of which approximately  was financed through long term debt equipment financing arrangements 
as of december   there were no further borrowings available under the financing arrangements 
if we do not obtain additional credit arrangements  we will need to spend our own resources for future equipment purchases 
as of december   our aggregate contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases capital leases long term debt elan convertible loan and accrued interest we anticipate that our existing capital resources  including the proceeds from our january financing and exclusive of potential payments from licensing partners  will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least january however  we base this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
our cash needs may also vary materially from our current expectations because of numerous factors  including results of research and development efforts  financial terms of definitive license agreements or other commercial agreements we enter into  if any  relationships with collaborative partners  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  technological advances  results of clinical testing  requirements of the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies  and acquisitions or investment in complimentary businesses  products or technologies 
we will need substantial funds of our own or from third parties to conduct research and development programs  conduct preclinical and clinical testing  and manufacture or have manufactured and market or have marketed potential products using the gr system 
our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as we may be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
we have limited credit facilities and no other committed sources of capital 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities or from development and licensing arrangements to continue our development programs 
we may not be able to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders equity positions 
if adequate funds are not available we may have to delay  postpone or terminate clinical trials  curtail other operations significantly  and or obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
the inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on our company 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments  as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the eitf delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance 
the company is in the process of evaluating the effect of adopting eitf in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment fas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
fas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fas r is similar to the approach described in fas fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is not longer an alternative 
fas r must be adopted by us no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt fas r on july  fas r permits public companies to adopt its requirement using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of fas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of fas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt fas r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by fas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options where the exercise price equals the fair market value of the underlying common shares on the measurement date 
accordingly  the adoption of fas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of fas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of fas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and loss per share in note  to our consolidated financial statements 
fas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  and whether we will be in a taxable position 
there is no tax impact related to the prior periods since we are in a net loss position 
additional factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company 
we believe the following risks  along with the risks described elsewhere in this form k  are the material risks we face at the present time 
if any of the risks or uncertainties described in this form k actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the risks and uncertainties described in this form k are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 
we are at an early stage of development and are expecting operating losses in the future 
to date  we have had no revenues from product sales and only minimal revenues from our collaborative research and development arrangements and feasibility studies 
for the years ended december   and  we had total revenues of million in and million in and  in for the years ended december   and  we incurred losses of million in and million in and million in as we continue our research and development efforts  preclinical testing and clinical trial activities  we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next two years 
therefore  we expect our cumulative losses to increase 
these losses  among other things  have had  and we expect that they will continue to have  an adverse impact on our total assets  shareholders equity and working capital 
we depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of our lead product candidates  glumetza mg and proquin  each of which is still subject to approval by the fda  and our other product candidates  which are in early stages of development  and on our core technology platform  the gr system 
to date  we have not commercialized any products 
two of our product candidates  glumetza mg and proquin  each have an nda filed with the fda 
our other product candidates are in earlier stages of clinical or preclinical development 
we anticipate that in the near term our ability to generate revenues will depend principally on the successful commercialization of glumetza and proquin 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approval for  or successfully commercialize  glumetza mg or proquin  our ability to raise financing and our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
also  our various product candidates use the gr system 
if it is discovered that the gr system could have adverse effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective as a delivery system for drugs or therapeutics  our product development efforts and our business would be significantly harmed 
we will receive future payments from biovail related to glumetza only if glumetza is approved by the fda 
in may  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with biovail to manufacture and market glumetza in the united states and canada 
we were responsible for completing the clinical development of glumetza 
biovail will not reimburse us for any of our expenses incurred in connection with the development of glumetza 
in february  biovail received an approvable letter from the fda requiring certain additional steps be taken prior to approval of the drug 
only if we receive fda approval of glumetza will biovail be required to make a million milestone payment to us 
we will not receive any other payments from biovail unless the fda approves glumetza for marketing in the united states  which we do not expect to occur prior to the first half of  if at all 
biovail can sublicense its rights to glumetza  and has indicated that it plans to do so  in which event we would depend on the sublicensee to commercialize glumetza 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and affect our stock price 
the following factors will affect our quarterly operating results and may result in a material adverse effect on our stock price our success or failure in entering into further collaborative relationships  variations in revenues obtained from collaborative agreements  including milestone payments  royalties  license fees and other contract revenues  decisions by collaborative partners to proceed or not to proceed with subsequent phases of the collaboration or program  the timing of any future product introductions by us or our collaborative partners  market acceptance of the gr system  regulatory actions  adoption of new technologies  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents  infringement allegations and litigation matters  the introduction of new products by our competitors  manufacturing costs and difficulties  results of clinical trials for our products  changes in government funding  third party reimbursement policies  and the status of our compliance with the provision of the sarbanes oxley act of our collaborative arrangements may give rise to disputes over commercial terms  contract interpretation and ownership of our intellectual property and may adversely affect the commercial success of our products 
we currently have a collaboration agreement with biovail to develop glumetza 
in addition  we have entered into other collaborative arrangements  some of which have been based on less definitive agreements  such as memoranda of understanding  material transfer agreements  options or feasibility agreements and we may not execute definitive agreements formalizing these arrangements 
collaborative relationships are generally complex and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights  obligations and revenues of the parties  including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations  especially when the applicable provisions have not been fully negotiated 
such disputes can delay collaborative research  development or commercialization of potential products  or can lead to lengthy  expensive litigation or arbitration 
the terms of collaborative arrangements may also limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies developed pursuant to such collaborations 
additionally  the collaborators under these arrangements might breach the terms of their respective agreements or fail to prevent infringement of the licensed patents by third parties 
moreover  negotiating collaborative arrangements often takes considerably longer to conclude than the parties initially anticipate  which could cause us to agree to less favorable agreement terms that delay or defer recovery of our development costs and reduce the funding available to support key programs 
we may not be able to enter into future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms  which would harm our ability to commercialize our products 
further  even if we do enter into collaboration arrangements  it is possible that our collaborative partners may not choose to develop and commercialize products using the gr system technologies 
other factors relating to collaborations that may adversely affect the commercial success of our products include any parallel development by a collaborative partner of competitive technologies or products  arrangements with collaborative partners that limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies  premature termination of a collaboration agreement  or failure by a collaborative partner to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercial sales of products using the gr system 
generally  our collaborative arrangements do not restrict our collaborative partners from competing with us or restrict their ability to market or sell competitive products 
our current and any future collaborative partners may pursue existing or other development stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
our collaborative partners may also terminate their collaborative relationships with us or otherwise decide not to proceed with development and commercialization of our products 
it is difficult to develop a successful product 
if we do not develop a successful product we may not be able to raise additional funds 
the drug development process is costly  time consuming and subject to unpredictable delays and failures 
before we or others make commercial sales of products using the gr system  we  our current and any future collaborative partners will need to conduct preclinical and clinical tests showing that these products are safe and effective  and obtain regulatory approval from the fda and foreign regulatory authorities 
we will have to curtail  redirect or eliminate our product development programs if we or our collaborative partners find that the gr system has unintended or undesirable side effects  or products that appear promising in preclinical or early stage clinical studies do not demonstrate efficacy in later stage  larger scale clinical trials 
even if our products obtain regulatory approval  successful commercialization would require market acceptance  cost effective commercial scale production  and reimbursement under private or governmental health plans 
any material delay or failure in the governmental approval process and or the commercialization of our potential products  particularly glumetza or proquin xr  would adversely impact our financial position and liquidity and would make it difficult for us to raise financing on favorable terms  if at all 
if we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect  the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and our business will be harmed 
for planning purposes  we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific  clinical  regulatory and other product development goals 
these milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings 
from time to time  we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones 
all of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions 
the actual timing of these milestones can vary considerably from our estimates depending on numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control  including our ability to obtain adequate funding  the rate of progress  costs and results of our clinical trial and research and development activities  including the extent of scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions and our ability to identify and enroll patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria  our receipt of approvals by the fda and other regulatory agencies and the timing thereof  other actions by regulators  our ability to access sufficient  reliable and affordable supplies of components used in the manufacture of our product candidates  including insulin and materials for our gr system  and the costs of ramping up and maintaining manufacturing operations  as necessary  if we fail to achieve our announced milestones in the timeframes we announce and expect  our business and results of operations may be harmed and the price of our stock may decline 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval  we will be limited in our ability to commercialize our products  and our business will be harmed 
our collaborative partner  biovail  submitted the nda to the fda for glumetza in april the fda accepted the nda for review in june because the nda submitted by biovail for the glumetza mg tablet metformin gr also seeks approval for biovail s mg metformin tablet  which has a different extended release technology  any issues that may arise in the fda review process with respect to the biovail tablet could delay approval of the mg glumetza tablet 
in february  biovail received an approvable letter from the fda requiring certain additional steps be taken prior to approval of the drug 
the earliest that we expect to be able to obtain fda approval to market glumetza is in the second quarter of  if at all 
in july  we filed an nda to the fda for our internally developed once daily formulation of the antibiotic drug ciprofloxacin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection  called proquin 
the fda accepted the nda for review in september the earliest that we expect to be able to obtain fda approval to market proquin is in the second quarter of  if at all 
we believe that the application submitted to the fda for proquin will be reviewed as a full  stand alone nda under section b of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or fdc act 
there is the possibility  however  that to the extent that any such application refers to information in the scientific literature  the fda will deem it to be what is known as a b nda  named after the section of the fdc act that permits it to be filed 
section b of the fdc act permits the filing of an nda for which at least some of the information required for product approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference 
if the fda deems that an application is a b nda  we will be required to identify the listed drug 
the listed drug is the drug for which the fda has made a finding of safety and effectiveness on which the applicant relies to seek approval of its product 
in addition to identifying the listed drug  we will be required to certify in the application as to whether or not its product may infringe any relevant patents on the listed drug 
in addition  a b nda would be subject to any market exclusivity of the listed drug 
if the fda determines that an application is a b nda  and the application is approved  these additional requirements may result in a delay of the effective date of the application approval of the application 
the regulatory process is expensive and time consuming 
even after investing significant time and expenditures on clinical trials  we may not obtain regulatory approval of our products 
data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
significant clinical trial delays would impair our ability to commercialize our products and could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do 
in addition  changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections 
even if we receive regulatory approval  this approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which we can market a product 
further  once regulatory approval is obtained  a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review 
the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product  manufacturer or manufacturing facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
manufacturers of approved products are also subject to ongoing regulation  including compliance with fda regulations governing current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulations can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
pharmaceutical marketing is subject to substantial regulation in the united states 
even if we obtain approval to market our products in the united states  our marketing activities will be subject to numerous federal and state laws governing the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
the fda regulates post approval promotional labeling and advertising to ensure that they conform with statutory and regulatory requirements 
in addition to fda restrictions  the marketing of prescription drugs is subject to laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse under government healthcare programs 
for example  the federal healthcare program antikickback statute prohibits giving things of value to induce the prescribing or purchase of products that are reimbursed by federal healthcare programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
in addition  federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government 
under this law  the federal government in recent years has brought claims against drug manufacturers alleging that certain marketing activities caused false claims for prescription drugs to be submitted to federal programs 
many states have similar statutes or regulations  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in some states  regardless of the payor 
if we  or our collaborative partners  fail to comply with applicable fda regulations or other laws or regulations relating to the marketing of our products  we could be subject to criminal prosecution  civil penalties  seizure of products  injunction  exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs  as well as other regulatory actions against our product candidates  our collaborative partners or us 
the approval process outside the united states is uncertain and may limit our ability to develop  manufacture and sell our products internationally 
to market any of our products outside of the united states  we and our collaborative partners are subject to numerous and varying foreign regulatory requirements  implemented by foreign health authorities  governing the design and conduct of human clinical trials and marketing approval for drug products 
the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval set forth above  and approval by the fda does not ensure approval by the health authorities of any other country  nor does the approval by foreign health authorities ensure approval by the fda 
if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third party payors  we will be unable to generate significant revenues 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our product candidates will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit management companies  and other healthcare related organizations 
if reimbursement is not available for our product candidates  demand for these products may be limited 
further  any delay in receiving approval for reimbursement from third party payors would have an adverse effect on our revenues 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  including pharmaceuticals 
our product candidates may not be considered cost effective  and adequate third party reimbursement may be unavailable to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an acceptable return on our investment 
federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare 
existing regulations affecting pricing may also change before any of our product candidates are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we may develop in the future 
increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly impact our results of operations 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours in understanding and complying with these laws  regulations and standards 
as a result of this uncertainty and other factors  devoting the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities 
we also expect these developments to increase our legal compliance and financial reporting costs 
in addition  these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
moreover  we may not be able to comply with these new rules and regulations on a timely basis 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
to the extent these costs are significant  our general and administrative expenses are likely to increase 
business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business 
our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
in particular  our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area  which is known for seismic activity 
we have not established a formal disaster recovery plan  and our back up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur 
a significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our operating results have not been sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in short term debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities would not change by a significant amount 
foreign currency fluctuations we have not had any significant transactions in foreign currencies  nor did we have any balances that were due or payable in foreign currencies at december  therefore  a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we do not hedge any of our foreign currency exposure
