item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company profile we design  manufacture and market residential and commercial products under the maytag  hoover  jenn air  amana  dixie narco  jade and other brand names 
we have two reporting segments home appliances and commercial products 
our home appliances segment manufactures and sells major appliances and floor care products that are sold primarily to major national retailers and independent retail dealers in north america and targeted international markets 
this segment services major appliances manufactured by us and by other major appliance manufacturers 
this segment also services floor care products manufactured by us 
our commercial products segment manufactures and sells vending equipment and commercial cooking products 
these products are sold primarily to distributors and soft drink bottlers in north america and targeted international markets 
our principal competition is from other appliance manufacturers including whirlpool  general electric and electrolux as well as several competitors from asia and europe 
product quality  price and functionality are the important areas of competitive differentiation 
maytag has positioned itself as a premium and mid priced player in the industry based on product quality and innovative features 
in addition  our brands are some of the most recognizable and respected names in the industry 
overview of results consolidated net sales decreased in as compared to the prior year 
net sales declined in home appliances and in commercial products 
a significant reduction in floor care sales and lower sales of vending equipment were the primary reasons for the decline in consolidated net sales 
operating income for was million compared to million in the prior year 
the primary reasons for the operating income decline were lower volume and margins for floor care products  increased costs  primarily for steel and energy related items  and higher distribution costs  charges of million in connection with product related litigation  primarily involving early generation front load washers 
this decline was partially offset by a pre tax gain of million in resulting from the sale of a warehouse in burlington  ontario and cost savings from restructuring plans 
pre tax restructuring and related charges of million were recorded in that included million primarily related to closing the galesburg  illinois  refrigeration facility and million related to a major restructuring to consolidate the hoover floor care  maytag appliances  and corporate headquarters organizations 
restructuring charges in also included a million gain on the sale of a former cooking appliance facility in indianapolis  indiana 
a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in for the commercial cooking equipment business 
in the prior year  we recorded pre tax restructuring and related charges of million  comprised of million for the galesburg plant closing  million primarily in connection with a salaried workforce reduction  and an asset impairment charge of million 
the consolidated net loss for was million or per share compared to consolidated net income of million or per share in the prior year 
the results per share for the full year of and included the following items expense income restructuring and related charges galesburg restructuring and related charges reorganization asset impairment goodwill impairment commercial products front load washer litigation adverse judgment on pre acquisition distributor lawsuit gain on sale of property home appliances loss on investment income from discontinued operations 
table of contents cash flow from continuing operations was million in compared to million in the prior year 
the lower cash flow from operations in resulted primarily from a net loss in compared to net income in total debt  including long term debt  the current portion of long term debt  and notes payable  increased by million from million at the end of to million at the end of cash and short term investments increased by million from million at the end of to million at the end of business results percent of sales percent of sales percent of sales in millions except per share data net sales home appliances commercial products total net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring and related charges asset impairment goodwill impairment front load washer litigation operating income loss home appliances commercial products total operating income net income loss earnings loss per share the fiscal year consisted of weeks  the other years in this table consisted of weeks 
the home appliances segment in included million in restructuring and related charges and a million charge for front load washer litigation 
the segment also included a million gain on the sale of property in the segment included million and million of restructuring charges in and  respectively  and a million asset impairment charge in the commercial products segment included million and million in restructuring charges in and  respectively 
the segment included a million goodwill impairment charge in results of operations compared to consolidated net sales in decreased by million or compared to the prior year 
in home appliances  a significant reduction in floor care sales and market share was the primary contributor to an overall decline of 
sales of major appliances increased slightly in compared to the prior year but market share declined in all categories in a strong industry 
future sales might be adversely impacted  because effective in the first quarter of we will no longer sell major appliances to best buy a customer with major appliances sales representing approximately of consolidated net sales in and because home depot  one of maytag s largest customers representing approximately of consolidated net sales in  recently decided to begin selling major appliances of a foreign competitor 
international export sales increased in 
table of contents compared to the prior year because of growth initiatives and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues for service operations also increased in commercial products sales declined by as a result of weakness in the vending equipment industry 
gross profit declined to of consolidated net sales in from in due to increased costs  primarily steel and energy related items  lower average selling prices in floor care  and higher distribution costs 
gross profit in included a million gain from the sale of the burlington  ontario  warehouse 
we anticipate that year over year comparisons of gross profit in the first half of will be adversely impacted by the significant steel cost increases that occurred in the second half of in addition  the outlook for future material costs remains uncertain 
although we have recently implemented several price increases to compensate for higher material costs  the impact of these price increases is uncertain due to potential competitive reactions and the uncertainty of consumer acceptance 
pension and postretirement medical costs are also expected to be higher in due to changes in assumptions related to the discount rate and future medical cost trends 
selling  general and administrative expenses for declined to of consolidated net sales compared to of consolidated net sales for the prior year 
the reduction in these costs  both as a percentage of sales and in absolute terms  is the result of cost reduction initiatives including reductions in the salaried workforce  reductions in national advertising related to new product introductions in the prior year  lower bad debt expense  and lower incentive compensation expense 
lower bad debt expense primarily resulted from the reversal of a reserve for a large national customer whose financial performance improved in lower incentive compensation expense was due to operating income that was lower than the targets established as the basis for incentive pay 
consolidated operating income declined to million or of consolidated net sales in from million or of consolidated net sales in operating income in home appliances declined to million or of net sales in from million or of net sales in as a result of the goodwill impairment charge and lower revenues  we had operating losses of million in commercial products in compared to operating income of million in the prior year 
in addition to the lower gross profit margins that more than offset lower selling  general and administrative expenses  operating income also included the following items restructuring and related charges of million were recorded in connection with the plan announced in the second quarter of to consolidate the hoover floor care  maytag appliances  and corporate headquarters organizations 
this consolidation is essentially complete  and we expect this plan to result in annual cost savings of approximately million  approximately million of cost savings were realized in we expect to record charges of approximately million in in connection with this plan 
in  we recorded a charge for restructuring of million related to a salaried workforce reduction 
restructuring and related charges of million were recorded in in connection with closing the galesburg  illinois  refrigeration plant  as compared to million of charges in the total restructuring and related charges for closing the galesburg plant are anticipated to be approximately million  with approximately million being cash expenditures 
charges of million have been recorded to date  of which million were cash expenditures 
the annual cost savings from the closing of this facility are anticipated to be million with approximately million realized in the fourth quarter of pretax charges of million were recorded in home appliances in in connection with product related litigation  primarily involving early generation front load washers 
a more detailed discussion of this charge is included under contingencies 
a million charge was recorded in for goodwill impairment related to the commercial cooking equipment business in commercial products based on operating losses and lower forecasts for future operating cash flows 
in  we recorded an million charge for asset impairment related to floor care operations 

table of contents restructuring charges in home appliances in also included a million gain on the sale of a former cooking appliance facility in indianapolis  indiana 
for  other net income of million included gains on foreign currency exchange transactions and sales of equity investments 
in the prior year  other net income of million included interest income from notes receivable and a federal income tax refund partially offset by losses on foreign currency exchange transactions 
interest expense in increased to million compared to million in the prior year as a result of higher interest rates and lower capitalized interest 
higher interest rates resulted from the issuance of million of year medium term notes during the third quarter 
these notes had higher interest rates than the commercial paper outstanding in at the end of  we had no commercial paper outstanding compared to million outstanding at the end of a million judgment composed of million compensatory and million punitive damages was entered in against amana company  lp  the entity from which maytag purchased the amana business in the case involved the termination of a commercial distributorship prior to maytag s acquisition of the amana business 
in may  the th circuit court of appeals upheld the earlier judgment 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million in  increasing the reserve to cover this matter to million 
we are pursuing an appeal of this decision 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million compared to tax expense of million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of million in this tax benefit in was due to a net loss in compared to net income in  reduced income taxes on tax returns filed for  refunds received from amended tax returns filed for prior years  the nontaxable status of the federal reimbursement for retiree drug costs  and favorable canadian capital gains tax rates on the sale of the burlington  ontario  warehouse 
these favorable effects on the tax rate were partially offset by not recording a tax benefit on the goodwill impairment charge and establishing a valuation allowance for potentially unusable capital losses realized in in  we completed the sale of our interest in a joint venture in china for net proceeds of million 
in connection therewith  we recorded income of million in discontinued operations 
for  we recorded income of million in discontinued operations that included a million gain from the reversal of a reserve for a note receivable resulting from the sale of blodgett and million in losses related to the joint venture in china 
for the reasons outlined above  we recorded a net loss of million or per share in as compared to net income of million or per share in the prior year 
results of operations compared to consolidated net sales were up in as compared to home appliance sales were up and commercial products sales were up 
in home appliances  the increase in sales of major appliances was partially offset by lower sales of floor care products 
sales of major appliances in increased due to industry strength and product introductions by maytag 
the major appliance unit market share was flat in compared to with improvements in cooking and dishwasher categories offset by decreases in laundry and refrigeration 
the decline in floor care sales was due to a decrease in unit market share  pricing decreases  and a product mix shift within the industry towards products in lower price categories 
in commercial products  a decrease in sales of traditional venders was offset by increased sales of glass front venders  refurbished venders and coin changer products 
increased average selling prices related to glass front venders offset declining industry unit sales of venders 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of sales declined to in from in the decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales for was primarily attributable to sales of lower priced and lower margin floor care products in home appliances 
at the beginning of  in response to competitive pressures  we reduced prices for several floor care products 
as these prices did not result in increased volume  the impact on gross profit as a percent of sales was significant 
also  in  we recognized a gain on the sale of a distribution center of million that was recorded as a reduction in cost of goods sold 

table of contents significant increases in pension and postretirement medical expenses in  primarily due to assumption changes  also had an adverse impact on gross profit comparisons 
the assumption changes included a lower discount rate  a lower expected rate of return on pension assets  and a higher trend rate for health care costs as compared to the assumptions used for in addition to higher pension expenses  material cost increases  primarily for steel  also negatively impacted gross profit as a percentage of sales 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales in compared to of sales in the primary reason for the decline was a reduction in discretionary spending  a salaried workforce reduction  decreased bad debt expense and leverage from increased net sales 
consolidated operating income as a percentage of sales was in  down from in home appliances operating income as a percentage of sales was in  down from in reflecting lower gross profit margins in versus the operating income as a percentage of sales for commercial products was in  down from in as improved gross profit and lower selling  general and administrative expenses in vending equipment did not offset higher costs from short term inefficiencies within commercial cooking that resulted from a factory move and system installations 
the following items  included in operating income  were also factors in the comparability of operating income for versus restructuring and related charges of million were recorded in as compared to million recorded in the restructuring charges in included million for the anticipated closing of the refrigeration manufacturing facility in galesburg  illinois and million related to an additional restructuring program primarily consisting of a salaried workforce reduction 
in  the entire million was related to the closing of the refrigeration manufacturing facility 
most of these charges were included in the operating income of home appliances 
asset impairment charges of million were recorded in for assets employed in a floor care production facility in north canton  ohio 
these assets were involved in the production of a discontinued product line at that facility 
these assets were written down to fair value based on prices for similar assets 
interest expense for was lower than due to both reduced debt levels and lower average interest rates 
we recorded a million charge in for a loss on investment in a company with robotic technology for the floor care industry 
this investment had been accounted for under the equity method 
because of continuing projected negative cash flows  the investment would have required on going financial support 
therefore  the impairment of this investment was considered other than temporary 
other net was income of million in compared to a loss of million in the primary components of the income in were million of interest income related to notes receivable arising from the sale of blodgett  million of interest on a federal tax refund  million of interest from the settlement of a purchase contract dispute related to the acquisition of amana  offset by foreign currency exchange losses of million 
in  foreign currency exchange losses of million were the principal component of the annual expense 
the effective tax rates for and were and percent  respectively 
the decrease was due to lower earnings that caused fixed dollar tax credits to have a greater impact on reducing tax expense  thereby reducing the effective tax rate 
the rate decrease was partially offset by the loss on an investment for which no tax benefit was recorded as the realization of future tax benefit is uncertain 
during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to dispose of our interest in rongshida maytag  a joint venture located in china 
the business was classified as a discontinued operation during that quarter 
based on the status of negotiations to sell the business in  we recorded an after tax loss of million in the third quarter of to write down our investment in rongshida maytag to its fair value less costs to dispose 

table of contents in connection with the sale of blodgett  a manufacturer of cooking products  we received million of notes receivable but recorded a valuation reserve of million against the note due to the credit status of the buyer million  net 
in  we received payments of million in principal and million of accrued interest against these notes receivable 
based on the cash payments received and the improved financial position of the buyer  the million reserve was reversed and a gain was recognized in discontinued operations 
the decrease in net income in compared to was due primarily to the decrease in operating income 
the decrease in diluted earnings per share in compared to was also due primarily to the decrease in operating income as average diluted shares outstanding were comparable 
liquidity and capital resources in millions net cash provided by continuing operations net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in or provided by continuing operating activities cash flow provided by continuing operations in was million compared to million provided by continuing operations in the decline in cash flow from operations was primarily due to a net loss in compared to net income in and because overall working capital inventories plus accounts receivable less accounts payable was a source of cash in compared to being flat in these items were partially offset by lower pension contributions 
we made million in pension contributions in  of which million were voluntary contributions to the qualified pension plan 
in the prior year  pension contributions were million  of which million were voluntary contributions to the qualified pension plan 
in  we plan to make approximately million in voluntary contributions to the pension plan 
net cash used in investing activities capital expenditures in were million compared to million in the prior year 
capital spending was lower in after two years of significantly higher spending to build a new refrigeration facility in reynosa  mexico and to roll out new product platforms in all major appliance product categories 
these capital expenditures represent investments for new product designs  cost reduction programs  replacement of equipment  and government mandated product requirements 
net cash used in investing activities was also impacted by the net cash proceeds of million from the sale of the burlington  ontario  warehouse and million from the sale of our interest in a joint venture in china 
capital expenditures in are anticipated to be approximately million 
net cash used in or provided by financing activities our primary source of cash to fund working capital  capital expenditures and pension contributions is cash generated from operations 
requirements in excess of cash generated internally are typically funded by debt 
we expect to continue to generate sufficient internal cash flows to fund working capital requirements  investing activities and pension contributions 
our short term liquidity requirements  including seasonal working capital increases  are further supported by cash and short term investments of million at the end of and the million credit agreement to meet the near term requirements 
long term liquidity is also supported by debt issuance in the capital markets 
we have million in long term debt maturities during we expect to satisfy these obligations through various sources of funding  including cash and short term investments  the credit agreement and issuance of long term debt 
total debt long term debt  the current portion of long term debt  and notes payable increased from million at the end of to million at the end of cash and short term investments increased from million at the end of to million at the end of we issued million of year medium term notes during the third quarter of  and  as of the end of  we had no commercial paper notes payable outstanding 
we have a three year million credit agreement that expires march  the credit agreement includes financial covenants related to 
table of contents interest coverage and the ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
during  we obtained amendments to the credit agreement that provide us with additional flexibility for compliance with the financial covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of and we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants in based on our current operating plans 
however  if our business performance does not meet these expectations  we may need to seek further amendments to the credit agreement 
a failure to comply with the covenants in the credit agreement or any other event of default under the credit agreement would adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the credit agreement or through the sale of commercial paper 
dividend payments on common stock were million in as compared to million in the prior year 
shareholders equity we had a negative million in shareholders equity at the end of as compared to a positive million at the end of the lower shareholder equity reflects an additional minimum pension liability adjustment of million in in total  shareholders equity has been reduced by million for minimum pension liability adjustments that were recorded in each of the last four fiscal years 
in addition  shareholders equity has been adversely impacted by a share repurchase program that increased the cost of treasury stock held from thousand at december   to billion at december  the negative equity is not expected to pose a risk to liquidity as cash flows are anticipated to be sufficient and there are no covenants in any of our debt instruments that include equity or debt to equity ratios 
future obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations  including payments due by period 
the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for projected production needs to be utilized in the normal course of business operations 
for additional disclosures regarding long term commitments  see commitments and contingencies section in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the form k 
payments due by year in millions total thereafter long term debt future minimum lease payments for operating leases commitments for capital expenditures long term commitments purchase obligations future obligations and commitments contingencies we have contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business  including pending litigation  environmental remediation  taxes  and other claims 
the legal department estimates the costs to settle pending litigation  including legal expenses  based on experience involving similar cases  specific facts known  and  if applicable  based on judgments of outside counsel 
in connection with the normally recurring examination by the internal revenue service irs of our federal income tax returns for through  the irs has proposed adjustments to our income and tax credits that would result in additional tax 
one of the proposed adjustments relates to a transaction originally entered in of which certain tax benefits have continued to be recognized through these benefits were originally recognized in part  in  after the conclusion of a previous irs examination 
we disagree with this and most of the proposed adjustments and plan to contest all disputed adjustments through the appropriate levels of appeals  if necessary 
the outcome of these tax related matters is not expected to have a materially 
table of contents adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
pretax charges of million were recorded in home appliances in in connection with product related litigation  primarily involving early generation front load washers 
an million charge was recorded in the second quarter and a million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter following court approval of a settlement relating to litigation filed in the united states and receipt of preliminary claim data 
the settlement includes a fixed million for attorney fees and contingent amounts based on an estimate of administrative costs and anticipated repair and reimbursement expenses 
the fourth quarter adjustment reflects the most current estimate of costs of settlement of the us litigation based on statistical sampling of claims received to date 
the estimate is subject to fluctuations in claim volume  claim amount  claim type  claim validity and takeup rates related to purchase credits and potential exposure related to front load litigation in canada that was not resolved by the us settlement 
the claim periods in the ussettlement remain open until the third quarter of and the settlement is the subject of an appeal 
based on the information available at this time  we are unable to determine a range of total possible costs 
additional adjustments may be recorded as more information becomes available 
we have matters pending before the consumer product safety commission  including a previously announced recall of cooking products and an inquiry concerning a floor care product 
based on the information currently available  we do not believe that either of these matters will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
as of january   approximately million of undrawn stand by letters of credit were available which are primarily utilized to back workers compensation claims and extended service contracts if we were to fail to fund these obligations 
market risks our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to transactions  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency forward and option contracts are entered into to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures 
we hedge a portion of our anticipated foreign currency denominated export sales transactions  which are predominately in canadian dollars 
at january   a uniform percent strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies in which our sales are denominated would result in a decrease in net income of approximately million for the year ending december  this sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
we are exposed to commodity price risk related to our purchase of selected commodities used in the manufacturing of our products 
we have entered into commodity swap agreements to reduce the effect of changing raw material prices for selected commodities including natural gas 
at january   a uniform percent increase in the price of commodities covered by commodity swap agreements would have an insignificant effect on the fair market value of these commodity swap agreements 
for all commodities  a uniform percent increase in the price of future purchases of commodities would have a material impact on operational results 
our largest exposure is for steel prices  which have increased significantly in our commodity swap agreements do not provide any hedge for increases in steel prices 
interest rate risk for debt securities also poses a risk to our company 
we utilize interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount 
at january   an increase in interest rates of percent would result in a decrease in net income of approximately million for the year ending december  our market risks related to foreign currency exchange  commodity prices  and interest rates were similar in and  and there were no significant changes in the manner in which we managed those risks 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies and practices are those that management believes are most 
table of contents important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded based on an aging of accounts receivable and an estimated percentage of potentially uncollectible receivables in each aged category 
the percentages utilized to record the allowance for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience 
in addition  we specifically reserve for the receivables of customers who do not appear to have the ability to meet their financial obligations 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be revised by a material amount 
pensions we provide noncontributory defined benefit pensions for nearly all of our employees 
plans covering salaried  management and some nonunion hourly employees generally provide pension benefits that are based on employee s earnings and credited service 
plans covering union hourly and other nonunion hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service 
our funding policy for the plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of erisa  plus any additional amounts that we may determine to be appropriate 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a minimum liability is required to be established on the consolidated balance sheets representing the amount of unfunded accrued pension cost 
the unfunded accrued pension cost is the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets 
as allowed by fasb statement no 
 we use september as a measurement date to compute the minimum pension liability 
to account for its defined benefit plans in accordance with fasb statement no 
 three principal assumptions are required 
first  the discount rate must be determined that will be used to compute the present value of the accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
the rates of return on high quality fixed income investments are utilized to determine the appropriate discount rate 
at january   the rate utilized to determine the accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation was compared to and used for fiscal and  respectively 
this change in assumptions will result in an increase in pension expense in second  the rates of increase in future compensation levels must be determined for the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to calculate net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
at the end of the and fiscal years  this rate for salaried employees was compared to for fiscal the rate for non union hourly employees was at the end of the   and fiscal years 
any changes in assumptions that affect the projected benefit obligation are deferred to unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses is recognized when the cumulative total is outside of a corridor that is defined by fasb statement no 
as the greater of percent of the projected benefit obligation or percent of the market value of plan assets 
the third assumption that must be made to calculate pension expense is the expected rate of return on plan assets 
in order to reduce volatility in the calculation of pension cost  fasb statement no 
requires the utilization of an expected rate of return on plan assets 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is included with other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
the expected rate of return is based on the asset allocation within the plan assets as well as the historical and future expected returns for each of the asset classes within the portfolio 
the future expected returns on the asset classes are based on current market factors such as interest rates and expected market returns 
we calculate the asset return component of net periodic pension cost on a market related valuation of assets that smoothes actual returns and reduces year to year net periodic pension 
table of contents cost volatility 
as of january   there were cumulative asset losses of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
at the end of fiscal years and the assumption for the expected rate of return was 
for  the assumption for this rate was 
our approach to investment returns utilizes a mix of equity and debt securities to maximize the long term return of plan assets within a prudent level of risk 
the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and debt securities  and equity investments are diversified across domestic and international stocks as well as large and small capitalizations 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews  annual liability measurements and periodic asset liability studies 
the target allocation of equity securities is of the plan assets 
the target allocation of debt securities is of the plan assets 
the target allocations remained consistent for the and measurement dates 
a change in these target allocations may result in a change in the expected rate of returns used in the calculation of future pension expense 
at the end of  our accrued pension cost was million  an increase from million at the end of a minimum liability adjustment was recorded at the end of due to a higher accumulated benefit obligation that was partially offset by a higher value of plan assets 
the accumulated benefit obligation increased due to interest costs and actuarial losses 
the actuarial losses were primarily the result of a revision to the discount rate assumption 
the fair value of plan assets increased by million as gains on plan assets and employer contributions exceeded benefit payments 
net periodic pension cost decreased to million in fiscal from million in lowering the expected rate of return on plan assets by would have increased net periodic pension cost for by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by would have increased net periodic pension cost for by approximately million 
increasing the rate of increase in compensation levels by would have increased net periodic pension cost for by approximately million 
pension contributions decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we have no minimum funding requirements in  based on erisa requirements 
however  we intend to contribute approximately million in postretirement benefits postretirement health care and life insurance benefits are provided for certain employee groups in the united states 
most of the postretirement plans are contributory and contain certain other cost sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance 
the plans are unfunded 
employees do not vest and these benefits are subject to change 
death benefits for certain retired employees are funded as part of  and paid out of  pension plans 
we account for our postretirement benefits in accordance with fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which requires that the postretirement liability be reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and the postretirement cost be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as determined on an actuarial basis 
we use a september measurement date to compute the postretirement liability 
to account for postretirement benefits in accordance with fasb statement no 
 two main assumptions are required 
first  the discount rate must be determined to compute the present value of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and the net periodic postretirement cost for the subsequent year 
the rates of return on high quality fixed income investments are utilized to determine the discount rate 
at the end of fiscal year  our assumption for the discount rate was compared to and used for fiscal and  respectively 
second  an assumption must be made for the expected health care cost trend rate for the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and net periodic postretirement cost for the subsequent year 
at the end of  we adjusted this initial health care cost trend rate to from in the prior year 
the assumption for the expected health care cost trend rate decreases gradually to in and thereafter 
postretirement medical costs will increase in due to the changes in assumptions for the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate 

table of contents at the end of fiscal  the postretirement benefit liability was million  a decrease from million at the end of for  the net periodic postretirement cost was million  a decrease from million in net periodic postretirement cost decreased in as the result of new collective bargaining agreements in effect at north canton  ohio  floor care production facility and the newton  iowa  laundry production facility that provide for the elimination of postretirement medical benefits for affected employees on a transitional basis 
net periodic postretirement medical costs also decreased in as the result of the adoption of fsp b related to the change in medicare prescription drug coverage that provides a federal reimbursement of a portion of our future costs 
net periodic postretirement cost for is expected to increase from due to the change in the assumptions for the discount rate and health care cost trend rates 
increasing the expected health care cost trend rate would have increased net periodic postretirement cost for by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by would have increased net periodic postretirement cost for by approximately million 
litigation and tax contingencies in the normal course of its business  the company is involved in contractual disputes  environmental  administrative and legal proceedings and investigations of various types 
some of the legal proceedings include claims for substantial compensatory or exemplary damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages 
although any litigation  proceeding or investigation has an element of uncertainty  the company believes  after taking into account legal counsel s present evaluation of such actions  that the outcome of any proceeding  lawsuit or claim which is pending or threatened  or all of them combined  will not have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial condition 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations  for any particular quarterly or annual period  could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings or by the outcome of these proceedings 
our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities in the normal course of operations 
during the course of these audits  the authorities may question the positions taken in the return  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income between various tax jurisdictions  which can affect the amount of taxes ultimately due 
in evaluating the exposure associated with its various filing positions  we record reserves for probable exposures 
to the extent that we prevail in matters where accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of the accrual  the effective tax rate and results of operation in a given financial period may be impacted 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets whereby goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
the statement requires a two step process for impairment testing 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment only  compares the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with its net carrying amount on the financial statements 
fair value is determined as the amount at which the reporting unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement where available 
where these are not available  fair value of the reporting unit can be estimated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
these cash flow estimates must be based on reasonable and supportable assumptions  and consider all available evidence 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired  thus the second step of the process is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
if the carrying value of goodwill on the financial statements exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  the difference must be recognized as an impairment loss 
implied fair value of goodwill shall be determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
at the end of the second quarter of  we had indications of goodwill impairment in our commercial cooking business which had significant 
table of contents and unanticipated operating losses during the first half of the year 
based on the indication of impairment  we performed goodwill impairment testing earlier than our policy for performing annual tests in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the testing  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  reducing the goodwill in the commercial cooking business from million to million 
during the fourth quarters of and  step one of the impairment test of goodwill was performed and it was determined that the fair value of our reporting units that have goodwill exceeded the carrying value of the net assets specifically related to these reporting units 
goodwill included in home appliances totaled million at the end of  most of which related to the floor care product line 
goodwill included in commercial products totaled million at the end of  most of which related to the commercial cooking product line 
expected future cash flows for the reporting units tested were based on prospective assumptions and include business initiatives that are not currently reflected in the historical results 
maytag currently has no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 
warranty we provide a basic limited warranty for all of our major appliance  floor care and commercial products 
the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold 
we record a warranty expense at the time the product is sold in order to match our revenues with the relevant expenses related to those revenues 
our warranty expense is based on assumptions related to the historical service call rates for specific product lines and the average projected costs per service call including the costs for both parts and labor 
on a quarterly basis  a review of the warranty accrual is performed to determine the adequacy of the reserve 
factors that affect the warranty liability include the number of units shipped to customers  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the estimated cost per claim 
asset impairment in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  we utilize a three step approach for recording the impairment of long lived assets 
first  we have established procedures to identify indicators of impairment for individual long lived assets or groups of long lived assets that are associated with specific product lines or lines of business 
second  we test for the recoverability of the value of the assets if indicators of impairment are present 
in testing for recoverability  a projection of future cash flows related to the assets is developed 
if the total future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the long lived assets  the assets are deemed recoverable and no impairment is recorded 
if the future undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount recorded for these assets  a fair value of the assets in question must be developed in order to calculate the amount of the impairment 
for fair values  we first attempt to determine the amount at which the assets would be bought or sold in a current transaction between unrelated parties 
if that value is not available  then the discounted present value of the future cash flows related to these assets is used to determine the fair value of these assets 
in the third step  the fair value of the asset is compared to the carrying value and any difference between the fair value and the carrying amount is recorded as an asset impairment charge 
we continue to monitor our operations and business results for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and future charges for asset impairment are possible 
factors that could affect the calculation of asset impairment include the projected amount and estimated number of years of cash flows associated with potentially impaired assets 
accounting pronouncements in the fourth quarter of  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes abp opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r establishes accounting standards for equity instruments that an entity exchanges for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions where an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for share based payment transactions as it relates to employee services 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is to be recognized over the period during which an 
table of contents employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
if an employee terminates before the vesting period expires  any compensation cost recognized to date for that individual s equity instrument is reversed at the date of termination 
the grant date fair value of share options and similar instruments is to be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative to use abp opinion s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in statement no 
as originally issued 
under abp opinion  issuing stock options to employees generally resulted in recognition of no compensation cost 
statement no also required pro forma disclosure showing the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the company had applied the fair value recognition provision of statement no 
after a phase in period for statement no 
r  this type of disclosure will no longer be allowed 
alternative phase in methods are allowed under statement no 
r  which is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  while we have not yet determined the phase in method  we do not believe that any of the phase in methods will have a material effect on the company s consolidated statement of operations or balance sheet
