investors should carefully review the information contained in this report under the caption factors that may affect our future results and market price of our stock beginning on page overview we provide the contact center market an integrated performance optimization software suite that enables global enterprises to capture customer intelligence and optimize workforce performance 
our solution is comprised of voice over internet protocol voip telephony  compliance  high volume and business driven recording solutions  as well as performance analysis and e learning applications 
our software suite delivers an integrated system for continuous performance improvement in multimedia customer interaction centers  internet protocol ip telephony and back office environments 
these applications are designed to enhance the quality of customer interactions across multiple communications media  including the telephone  e mail and the internet  and are used primarily in the organization s contact center s 
our enterprise collaboration architecture allows contact center management to share information gathered in the contact center with other departments that service the customer  as well as throughout the organization 
the result is a proactive management tool for optimizing their customer relationship management crm  improving communication among departments  and fine tuning workflow  processes and quality of service from within the contact center and throughout the enterprise 
as a result  we believe our customers are able to generate additional revenue opportunities  improve profitability  enhance customer retention  reduce employee turnover and improve their overall customer service and intelligence 
using an integrated business consulting  installation and training methodology  we provide services to support an effective and rapid deployment of our software that enables organizations to maximize their return on an investment in our products and services 
our software is designed to integrate with a variety of third party software applications  such as crm and enterprise resource planning applications  and with existing telephony and computer network hardware and software 
many of our customers are companies with an international presence and one or more contact centers that handle voice and data customer interactions for outbound sales and marketing operations  inbound service support lines  or both 
we derive product revenue by licensing software and derive services revenue by providing related installation  training  consulting  and maintenance services 
we also derived a relatively small portion of product revenue by selling hardware to customers during and subsequent to the acquisition of eyretel plc eyretel in march to date  equality balance and equality contactstore  our business driven and or full time customer interaction recording solutions  have generated the majority of our product revenue 
we sell our products through our direct sales force and through our indirect sales channels 
our indirect sales channels consist of distributors  resellers  systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers oem 
distributors and resellers purchase product from us at a discount and then resell our products to end users or  in the case of distributors  to other resellers and referral partners are paid a fee for referring sales leads to us or for assisting us in a sales order 
systems integrators are information technology it consulting service companies who recommend our products during client engagements 
through oem agreements  we co develop products  which are sold by the oem as part of their portfolio of products 
we plan to grow our product revenue and maintain our competitive position from a technology perspective through the timely introduction of new products  such as performance analysis and e learning management applications  and platforms  such as voip product offerings  all of which are currently offered to our customers 
although sales of such products have not been material to date  we believe that our voip product offerings represent a material growth opportunity for us as the market transitions to an internet protocol ip technology environment 
in addition  we believe our product offerings can be marketed toward back office initiatives for business process monitoring  which represents a new market for us 
in january  we consummated the acquisition of blue pumpkin  inc  blue pumpkin in order to extend our contact center performance optimization capability to include advanced workforce management software and services solutions 
the acquisition expands our software and service offerings by adding forecasting  scheduling  adherence and planning applications 
see subsequent event for further information regarding the acquisition of blue pumpkin 
we also intend to continue to expand our global sales channels by entering into new reseller  distributor  oem and similar arrangements with key vendors in the contact center workforce optimization market 
during  of total product revenue  excluding hardware revenue  was derived from the indirect sales channel  compared to in factors that may impact our ability to grow our product revenue  however  include our ability to remain competitive from a technology perspective  market acceptance of our new products  our ability to maintain our product pricing integrity  and our ability to expand our global sales channels 
we also plan to grow our services revenue in concert with our product revenue 
when our customers license our products  they generally purchase installation  training and one year of support services 
therefore  as we generate product revenue  we also generate related services revenue 
in addition  our customers generally renew their maintenance contracts with us each year 
therefore  our maintenance revenue increases as our customer base increases 
factors that may influence our ability to grow our services revenue  however  include our ability to continue to increase product revenues and our ability to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction 
corporate spending for it and crm applications remained relatively constant in and we experienced nominal organic growth in while the economic environment remains challenging  we are forecasting additional revenue growth for during  we implemented a strategic initiative to expand our software development capabilities in the asia pacific region 
as of december   we had doubled our development capacity from the prior year by transitioning a portion of our development function to the asia pacific region and incurred approximately million for equipment and duplicative ramp up  salaries  training and severance costs associated with the development transition 
during the second quarter of  we completed the acquisition of eyretel  a united kingdom based provider of compliance and recording solutions for customer contact centers  for million 
we began consolidating eyretel s results on march   the date we assumed majority ownership of eyretel 
we acquired eyretel with the intent to extend our presence in international markets and to expand our product line by adding a full time compliance recording solution 
our product offerings were complementary to those of eyretel s 
prior to the acquisition  our principal focus had been software to improve the quality of contact center performance  whereas substantially all of eyretel s sales were attributable to its full time compliance recording solution 
in addition to this opportunity to expand our product line  eyretel was attractive to us because it derived nearly half of its revenues from europe  the middle east and africa  and another from the asia pacific region  and thus afforded us an opportunity to quickly gain access to those markets  and to expand our indirect sales channel 
during  we successfully integrated the two companies in terms of product offerings and business operations and reflects a full months of our combined product offering 
we are headquartered in roswell  georgia and have other offices throughout the united states 
we deliver our products and services internationally through our offices in australia  brazil  canada  china  germany  india  japan  mexico  the netherlands  singapore  south africa and the united kingdom 
during  and   and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from customers outside the united states 
we had full time employees  excluding approximately contractors located in the asia pacific region  at december   compared to at december  and at december  as of december   full time employees were located outside the united states 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the collectibility of receivables  accounting for acquisitions  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our critical accounting policies follows 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenue is primarily derived from licensing software and providing related services including maintenance 
during and  we also had a relatively small portion of hardware revenue  which commenced upon the acquisition of eyretel 
product revenue  which includes software and hardware  is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is probable and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists to allocate revenue to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
we report hardware revenue gross in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  because the factors indicating gross reporting outweigh the factors indicating net reporting 
we recognize revenue using the residual method of accounting since we generally have vsoe of fair value for maintenance and professional services  but not for the software and hardware elements of the order 
under the residual method  services revenue  including maintenance and professional services  is deferred at an amount equal to its fair value until those elements are delivered 
consequently  product revenue for the software and hardware may be recognized i upon delivery of those products when we have vsoe on the related maintenance and professional services sold and ii at an amount representing the difference between the total order amount and the amount deferred 
services revenue includes installation  training  consulting  maintenance and reimbursable travel expenses 
revenue from installation  training and consulting services is recognized upon performance of the related services and is offered and billed as separate elements of contracts 
reimbursable travel expenses revenue is recognized upon incurrence of the related expenses 
the functionality of the software and any hardware sold is not dependent on installation and training services and customization is not required to enable our customers to use our products 
maintenance is offered as a separate element and the majority of contracts include the right to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments and estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the underlying receivables  our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and we believe appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot assure that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past or adequately predict future credit losses 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and resulted in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional selling  general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates affect the application of our revenue policy described above 
further  assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenues should be recognized in the current market environment 
we also record provisions for estimated sales allowances on product and service related revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales and services allowances  analysis of customer credits and other known factors 
if future sales credits prove to be greater than the historical data and the estimates we used to calculate these provisions  our revenues could be overstated 
accounting for acquisitions 
accounting for acquisitions requires management to make judgments and estimates in determining the purchase price  the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and merger related and restructuring expenses 
in recording the eyretel acquisition in  management estimates primarily related to the following purchase price components or merger related costs valuation of deferred revenue  valuation of intangible assets and acquired in process research and development  lease termination costs and fair value estimates  severance expenses for employee terminations  contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition 
changes to purchase price estimates  prior to the completion of the final purchase price allocation  are reflected as adjustments to goodwill and or other acquired assets 
subsequent adjustments are reflected in our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
all of our intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method 
useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed annually with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
recoverability of assets to be held and used would be measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the determination of estimated future cash flows  however  would require management to make estimates 
future events and changes in circumstances may require us to record a significant impairment charge in the period in which such events or changes occur 
impairment testing requires considerable analysis and judgment in determining the results 
if other assumptions and estimates were used in our evaluations  the results could differ significantly 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires companies to recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets  primarily resulting from net operating loss and credit carryforwards  and adjust our valuation allowance  if necessary 
once we utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  we would expect our provision for income tax expense in future periods to reflect an effective tax rate that will be significantly higher than past periods 
furthermore  the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards arising from acquisitions will result in a reduction of the valuation allowance for the deferred income tax assets and intangible assets of million 
estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide income tax expense 
in the ordinary course of conducting business globally  there are many transactions and calculations whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of corporations are allowed an dividends received deduction in and on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer  provided certain criteria are met 
in  we will complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision 
at this time  the range of possible amounts that may be considered for repatriation  if any  and the tax effects of these amounts under this provision are unknown 
stock based compensation 
we generally do not record compensation expense for options granted to our employees because all options granted under our stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we have elected to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
the pro forma disclosures of stock based compensation include the use of certain input factors in calculating the fair value of stock option grants  some of which require management to make estimates and use judgment 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on alternative fair value models 
the share based compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
upon adoption  pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
we currently intend to apply sfas no 
r using the most appropriate fair value model as of the interim reporting period beginning july  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations  but not on our cash flows 
results of operations the table below shows operating data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  revenue product services total revenue cost of revenue product services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development merger related costs acquired in process research and development operating income loss interest and other income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss impact of eyretel acquisition the acquisition of eyretel increased our reported revenues and expenses in compared to in addition  our gross profit margins were adversely impacted during compared to due to the inclusion of hardware revenue without any significant profit margin and amortization of intangible assets arising from the eyretel acquisition 
operating expenses  expressed as a percentage of total revenue  increased in compared to due to the increase of million for the acquired in process research and development costs and the increase of million in merger related and restructuring costs 
we estimate that the acquisition of eyretel contributed approximately million of additional annual revenue and that we achieved approximately million of annual expense savings  primarily though reductions in overhead and personnel 
we believe that revenue and expenses beginning in the last half of reflected the full impact of the eyretel acquisition and integration 
revenue total revenue increased to million in compared to and to million in compared to due to increases in product and services revenue 
the number of installed customer sites grew to  sites at the end of from  sites at the end of and  sites at the end of international revenue increased in compared to and in compared to  due to the acquisition of eyretel  which was based in the united kingdom and had a broad international presence 
in addition  the weakening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies increased revenue by approximately and in and compared to the prior years 
product revenue includes software revenue and hardware revenue 
hardware revenue was a new revenue stream beginning in the second quarter of resulting from the eyretel acquisition 
because hardware sales negatively impact our gross profit margin  we are working towards transitioning our customers to third party hardware suppliers and  as a result  expect hardware revenue to decline in the future 
product revenue  excluding hardware revenue of million in and million in  increased and in and  respectively  compared to prior years due to increased sales in international markets and to an increase in the number of product offerings within our software product suite 
the growth in product revenue in and reflects revenue from the eyretel acquisition since march product revenue as a percentage of total revenue has been decreasing over the previous three years due to increased services revenue  as discussed below 
our product pricing has remained consistent over the previous three years 
product revenue  excluding hardware revenue  derived from our indirect sales channel increased to in from in and in this increase correlates to the increase in international revenue and to continually broadening our target market through our indirect sales channel 
if a substantial number of our indirect sales participants were to terminate their relationship with us  we could experience a material decrease to our revenues 
new customers accounted for  and  respectively  of product revenue  excluding hardware revenue  in  and compared to follow on revenue from our existing customer base 
we receive follow on revenue from our customers when they purchase additional user licenses or license additional applications at existing sites and when they license our products at new sites 
we expect to continue receiving the majority of our product revenue from existing customers during services revenue  consisting of installation  training  consulting  maintenance support and reimbursable travel expenses  increased to million in compared to and to million in compared to these increases were primarily due to the installation and training services related to new product sales and due to customers renewing their maintenance contracts with us thereby increasing our recurring maintenance revenue stream 
the growth in services revenue in and also reflects revenue from the eyretel acquisition since march the percentage of witness customers that have renewed their maintenance contracts with us has historically exceeded 
we believe that maintenance contracts will be renewed at a comparable rate in our services pricing has remained consistent over the past three years 
we expect services revenue  in absolute dollars  to increase over time due to the compounding effect of renewals of annual maintenance contracts from existing customer sites  and to remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue  excluding hardware revenue  in cost of revenue total cost of revenue increased to million in compared to and to million in compared to expressed as a percent of revenue  gross profit margins declined to in and from in excluding hardware cost of revenue  which was a new cost beginning in the second quarter of due to the eyretel acquisition  and the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the eyretel acquisition  gross profit margins declined to in and from in this decrease was due to the increase in services revenue relative to total revenue excluding hardware 
our profit margin for services is lower than our product profit margin because the costs related to providing services revenue  primarily labor related costs  are higher than those expenses related to generating product revenue 
for example  the cost to employ an installation technician is higher than the royalty due a third party for the number of software licenses sold and the cost to produce a cd rom containing a copy of one of our software programs for delivery to a client site 
we expect our gross profit margin  excluding hardware and amortization of intangible assets  to remain relatively constant in cost of product revenue consists of amortization of acquired technology  hardware costs  royalties due to third parties for software components that are embedded in our software applications  amortization of capitalized software development costs and packaging costs 
amortization of acquired technology was million and million in and  respectively  and none in cost of hardware revenue was million and million in and  respectively  and none in we will continue to incur amortization expense  but expect the cost of hardware to decline as we work towards reducing the amount of hardware sales in the future 
cost of product revenue  excluding amortization of acquired technology and hardware costs  increased in compared to and in compared to the increase in was primarily due to increased royalties due to third parties for software components that are embedded in our software applications 
expressed as a percentage of product revenue  excluding hardware  the cost of such revenue  excluding amortization of intangible assets was  and in  and  respectively 
as we develop upgrades of our existing products and add new offerings to our product suite  we may embed third party technology into our software  which would increase the cost of product revenue in the future 
cost of services revenue for installation  training  consulting and maintenance services include personnel costs and related expenses and allocated overhead 
personnel costs include salaries  bonuses and benefits 
cost of services revenue increased to million in compared to due primarily to an increase in the number of employees and contractors engaged in customer support services 
cost of services revenue increased to million in compared to primarily due to an increase in the number of employees engaged in installation  training  consulting  and customer support services primarily due to the eyretel acquisition 
cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue increased to in and from in this increase was primarily due to the cost of providing hardware support  which commenced in march in conjunction with the eyretel acquisition 
we anticipate that our services margins will remain relatively constant in we expect our customer service organization to continue to grow over time and  therefore  we anticipate that our cost of services revenue  in absolute dollars  will increase as we grow our customer base 
during the latter half of  we began expanding our customer support organization in the asia pacific region  however  we do not expect to incur any significant incremental costs associated with this initiative 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense consists primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs  professional fees  the amortization of certain intangible assets and provisions for bad debt expense 
sg a expense increased to million in compared to due primarily to increased third party costs associated with complying with the rules and regulations adopted under the sarbanes oxley act of and increased litigation fees to defend certain lawsuits which offset the decline in bad debt expense of million see note legal proceedings of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
sg a expense increased to million in compared to this increase was due to the increased size of our company after the eyretel acquisition and due to million of amortization of acquired intangible assets in and none in bad debt expense also increased by million in compared to primarily due to an increase in exposure from international receivables 
in  we expect sg a expense to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of total revenue due to anticipated revenue growth 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist primarily of personnel and consulting costs to support product development  and allocated overhead 
r d costs are generally expensed as incurred and include software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility 
costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives to cost of product revenue 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  in software development costs were capitalized of which million was amortized to cost of product revenue during prior to  software development costs incurred after technological feasibility had been established were not material 
r d expenses increased to million in compared to due to an increased number of contractors engaged in research and development activities 
during  we implemented a strategic initiative to significantly expand and improve our development capabilities by transitioning a portion of our development function to the asia pacific region 
as of december   we significantly increased our development capacity from the prior year by adding new contractors to the region and incurred approximately million for equipment and duplicative ramp up  training and severance costs associated with the development transition 
r d expenses increased to million in compared to primarily due to an increased number of employees engaged in research and development activities 
we expect total r d expense to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of total revenue during as compared to merger related costs 
during and  we incurred merger related costs pertaining to the acquisition of eyretel in march and the blue pumpkin acquisition that closed in january see subsequent event for further information regarding the acquisition of blue pumpkin 
we incurred merger related costs of million during these merger related costs included million relating to the partial accrual of a bonus payable to eyretel s former chief executive officer  now our chief operating officer coo  million of expenses related to the integration of blue pumpkin s operations with witness  offset by million for adjustments to certain eyretel acquisition liabilities 
in march  our board of directors agreed to pay a bonus of million to our coo in connection with the eyretel acquisition and subsequent integration 
in march  million of this bonus was paid and the remaining balance of million or million as of december  is due march the coo bonus is recognized over the related service period through the first quarter of we expect to incur additional merger related costs in related to the blue pumpkin acquisition  however  we are unable to estimate the amount at this time 
we incurred merger related costs of million during these merger related costs included million of expenses related to integrating eyretel s software products  training personnel on products acquired and consolidating the operations of eyretel with witness  million of facilities costs to consolidate witness facilities  million of expenses related to employee severance and benefits  million for a sterling based forward exchange contract to hedge the dollar cost of the acquisition  and million relating primarily to the partial accrual of the aforementioned bonus payable to our coo 
acquired in process research and development 
in  we estimated that million of the purchase price of eyretel represented acquired in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  these amounts were immediately charged to expense upon consummation of the acquisition 
the value of the ipr d was calculated with the assistance of an independent third party appraiser by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in process technologies and taking into consideration stage of completion  complexity of work to date and to complete  anticipated product development and introduction schedules  forecasted product sales cycles  internal and external risk factors  revenue and operating expense estimates  contributory asset charges  and costs already incurred and the expected costs to complete 
we expect to incur ipr d charges in related to the blue pumpkin acquisition  however  we are unable to estimate the amount at this time 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on funds available for investment and foreign currency transaction gains and losses on settlement of contracts denominated in currencies other than the local currency 
interest and other income  net decreased to million in compared to due primarily to a decrease in net foreign currency transaction gains in which offset increased interest income resulting from higher cash and investment balances 
interest and other income  net decreased to million in compared to due primarily to decreased interest income resulting from lower yields and lower investment balances as a result of the acquisition of eyretel which was paid for in cash 
we expect that interest and other income  net will decrease significantly in compared to due to lower cash and investment balances as a result of our utilizing million of cash to acquire blue pumpkin in january provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for federal alternative minimum tax and foreign income tax in and provisions for foreign income tax in and  net of federal tax benefits 
the provision for income taxes in benefited from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from prior years 
we have net operating loss carryforwards aggregating million for us tax purposes and million for foreign tax purposes remaining as of december  we expect that the provision for income taxes in will benefit from the utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards 
however  the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards arising from acquisitions will result in a reduction of the valuation allowance for the deferred income tax assets and intangible assets

product revenue includes hardware sales of million  million  million and million in the fourth  third  second and first quarters of  respectively and million  million and million in the fourth  third and second quarters of  respectively 
services revenue in absolute dollars  and as a percentage of total revenue  generally increased during and due to the compounding effect of maintenance renewals and the expansion of our service offerings 
the services margin improved in the fourth quarter of due to efficiencies gained in providing installation  training and consulting services 
gross profit margins have been negatively impacted beginning in the second quarter of due to hardware costs and amortization of intangibles 
total operating expenses  excluding merger related costs and acquired ipr d  decreased as a percentage of total revenue during as revenue growth exceeded cost increases 
during  total operating expenses  excluding merger related costs and acquired ipr d  decreased as a percentage of total revenue due to the realization of synergies from the eyretel acquisition  in addition to implementing certain cost saving measures throughout the year 
our quarterly operating results  particularly product revenues  have experienced significant fluctuations in the past and we expect that this pattern will continue in the future 
for instance  quarterly results may fluctuate based on the timing of sales due to customer calendar year budgeting cycles  slow summer purchasing patterns and compensation policies that tend to compensate sales personnel  typically in the latter half of the year  for achieving annual quotas 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results are not necessarily meaningful  and such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in total cash and cash equivalents and investments  which was million higher than the million held at december  working capital also increased by million from million at december  to million at december  accrued expenses decreased by million at december   from december   due primarily to the payment of eyretel acquisition and merger related liabilities 
deferred revenue increased by million at december   from december   due to primarily to an increase in the number of customers under maintenance contracts 
cash flows from operating activities provided million in compared to cash flows used in operating activities of million in this increase was due primarily to the increase in operating income  exclusive of non cash items  which increased to million in  from million in this increase resulted from the improvement in operating performance and the reduction in merger related costs in compared to our annual accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso decreased from days in to days in we expect our dso to remain at the december  level during in  we generated million in cash flows from operating activities primarily due to net income excluding non cash items and an increase in deferred revenue 
net cash flows used in investing activities in were million  which consisted primarily of the purchase of additional investments 
net cash flows used in investing activities in were million  which included the sale of investments of million to initially fund the eyretel acquisition  partially offset by the acquisition of eyretel for million net of million in cash held by eyretel and certain other assets purchased for million from a software and services company focused on the business intelligence marketplace 
net cash flows provided by investing activities in were million due primarily to the release of our restricted cash and the maturities of certain investments 
capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  were primarily for computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash flows provided by financing activities in were million compared to million in the increase was primarily due to million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash flows used in financing activities were million in primarily due to stock repurchases of million 
we have repurchased a total of million of our common stock under our million stock repurchase authorization and at this time  we do not anticipate making any further repurchases 
at december   we had million available under a line of credit  which was net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
the letters of credit secure the lease on our corporate headquarters facility and have decreasing schedules that ultimately expire in at our election  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate  or libor plus basis points  and are limited to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined by the agreement 
the revolving line of credit is secured by all of our assets and requires compliance with various covenants  including liquidity ratios and tangible net worth requirements  among others 
as of december   we were in compliance with all bank covenants 
in association with a acquisition  we replaced our tangible net worth requirement with an ebitda financial covenant 
see subsequent event for further information regarding the acquisition of blue pumpkin 
in january  we liquidated our investment portfolio and paid million in cash for the acquisition of blue pumpkin 
in addition  we are in the process of registering the million shares of our common stock issued to the blue pumpkin shareholders as part of the purchase price 
the registration of these shares requires our filing additional information with the sec and the subsequent order of the sec declaring our registration statement effective 
we also expect to spend an additional million for acquisition and merger related costs related to the blue pumpkin acquisition 
we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures in primarily for computer equipment and software 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will increase over the next several years as we expand our facilities and acquire equipment to support the expansion of our research and development activities and internal management information systems 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  the availability under our line of credit may be used to fund working capital requirements or future merger or acquisition transactions 
our shelf registration statement on form s including subsequent amendments with the securities and exchange commission sec became effective in august the shelf registration statement allows us to register up to million of securities  which may consist of common stock  warrants to purchase our common stock  or both 
the shelf registration statement provides us the ability to raise equity capital if and when appropriate for our business 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements and we are unable or choose not to raise additional equity capital or borrow under our line of credit  we may seek to establish new financing arrangements 
we cannot assure that any financing arrangements will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure primarily relates to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
except for the hedge transaction entered into in connection with the eyretel acquisition  we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection with such fluctuations 
due to the relative strength of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar during and  foreign currency translations contributed million and million to our december  and  respectively  cash balances as a result of our subsidiaries cash denominated in foreign currencies 
as of december   foreign currencies impacted cash by million 
within our foreign based operations  where transactions may be denominated in foreign currencies  we are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have foreign based operations in australia  brazil  canada  india  japan  mexico  and the united kingdom and conduct transactions in either the local currency of the location or us dollars 
we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes 
historically  these risks have been minimal  but as our international operations continue to grow  adverse currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
cummulative translation adjustment changes resulted in an increase in stockholders equity of million and million in and  respectively 
net foreign exchange gains were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio and any potential borrowing 
our investments are made with capital preservation and liquidity as our primary objectives 
we generally hold only high grade investments such as commercial paper  corporate bonds  auction rate securities and us government agency securities 
to reduce our balance sheet exposure to variations in asset values  our investment policy guidelines specify that we invest in the highest investment grade securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of nine months for our entire portfolio 
our investment portfolio may contain securities with maturities of up to three years 
while this minimizes our interest rate risk to asset values  our results are exposed to fluctuations in interest income due to changes in market rates 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   our contractual cash obligations associated with lease obligations  operational restructuring and merger related costs are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations     acquisition related commitments   total      as of december   we did not have any other material contractual commitments or any off balance sheet arrangements 
transactions with related parties during  notes receivable due from certain officers totaling million were satisfied by delivering  at current fair market value  shares of our common stock  which such employees had held for longer than six months 
in february  the notes receivable from our ceo totaling million were refinanced in part with a full recourse note the note for approximately million with floating monthly interest of basis points over the federal funds rate 
the note was payable in three equal payments of principal and interest due annually through february the balance was satisfied in full during by the ceo delivering at current fair market value  shares of our common stock  which he had held for more than six months 
there were no transactions with related parties during subsequent event on january   we completed the acquisition of blue pumpkin software  inc blue pumpkin  a privately held california corporation 
pursuant to the merger agreement and plan of reorganization  dated december  the merger  we paid an aggregate of million in cash  which was financed from our existing cash and investments  and issued an aggregate of million unregistered shares of witness common stock 
on january   we filed a re sale registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec to register those shares 
that registration statement is not yet effective 
ten percent of the aggregate merger consideration is being held in escrow for one year after the closing date of the merger 
the escrow period may be extended in the event that there are pending claims that are brought against the escrow fund within such one year period 
the escrow fund is available to compensate witness  subject to certain limitations  for losses resulting from  among other things  breaches of representations  warranties or covenants in the merger and certain pending and potential claims 
the merger is intended to extend our contact center performance optimization capability to include advanced workforce management software and services solutions 
the acquisition expands our software and services by adding forecasting  scheduling  adherence and planning applications 
factors that may affect our future results and market price of our stock our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future  and an investment in our common stock is subject to a variety of risks  including  but not limited to  the specific risks identified below 
inevitably  some investors in our securities will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the prices at which they purchase and sell our securities 
prospective and existing investors should consider the following factors in evaluating our business or an investment in our securities 
if any of the following or other risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
because our products have a long sales cycle  it is difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results  and our operating results may fail to meet investor expectations  which may adversely affect our stock price 
it typically takes three to nine months from the time we qualify a sales lead until we sign a sales contract with the customer 
as a result  it is difficult for us to predict the quarter in which a particular sale will occur 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large orders or a significant number of small orders  it would delay the timing of our revenue  but not the timing of most of our corresponding expenses 
lengthening of our sales cycle could also increase the total cost of a sale due to additional employee time and costs associated with the sale 
material changes in our sales cycle could cause our quarterly revenue or operating results to be below the expectations of investors  and the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our customers decision process regarding their purchase of our products and services is relatively long due to several factors  including the complex nature of our products  requiring our need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our products  competition for the corporate resources necessary to finance the purchase and implementation of our products  customers budgeting and purchasing cycles  the extent of customers evaluation and internal approval process often required before purchasing our products and services  and delayed purchases due to announcements of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us 
if our products and services are not used and accepted by existing and prospective customers  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
the market for customer relationship management software  including software that records and analyzes customer interactions and that forecasts and schedules employees  is still developing 
our success depends on the use and acceptance of our software and services by existing and prospective customers 
in addition  demand for our software remains uncertain because our existing and potential customers may not understand the benefits of using customer relationship management software generally or  more specifically  software which records and analyzes the interactions between a business and its customers or which optimizes the forecasting and scheduling of employees  not achieve favorable results using our software  experience technical difficulty in implementing our software  use alternative methods such as online self help to solve the same business problems our software is intended to address  or close contact centers 
if we experience losses from operations in the future  the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected 
with the exception of and the first half of  we have historically experienced quarterly losses from operations 
we will need to generate sufficient revenue to achieve sustained profitability and avoid incurring losses again in the future 
as a result of our prior operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our quarterly results are difficult to predict and adverse fluctuations in operating results could cause our stock price to fall 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and could fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in particular  we typically derive a significant portion of our software product revenue in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders 
the delay or failure to close anticipated sales in a particular quarter could reduce our revenue in that quarter and subsequent quarters over which revenue for the sale could be recognized 
in addition  because our revenue from installation and training services largely correlates with our product revenue  a decline in product revenue could also cause a decline in our professional services revenue in the same quarter or in subsequent quarters 
our quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast for several reasons  including the following changes in demand for our products and services  a failure by us to develop  market and manage new software  software enhancements and services that our customers require in a timely manner  lengthening of our customers budgeting and purchasing cycles  timing of any acquisitions and related costs  delays in installations of our software  varying sales and implementation cycles for our products and services from customer to customer  the failure of our customers to renew their maintenance service agreements  the timing of hiring new services employees and the rate at which these employees become productive  and the development and performance of our distribution channels 
as a result of these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indicator of our future performance  and you should not rely on them to predict our future performance or the performance of our stock price 
if our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
we may be unable to manage and expand our international operations  which may adversely affect our business and operating results 
we derived million  million and million in   and  respectively  from customers outside the united states  principally in the united kingdom  canada  australia  india  japan and china 
during  we completed the purchase of eyretel plc and significantly expanded our operations outside of north america 
our operations outside of the united states at december   consisted of dedicated employees located in australia  brazil  canada  china  germany  india  japan  malaysia  mexico  the netherlands  singapore  south africa and the united kingdom 
we have also established relationships with a number of international resellers 
with our acquisition of eyretel  which also has sales outside of north america  we have expanded our international operations  and we intend to continue to expand our international operations through additional acquisitions  internal business expansion and strategic business relationships 
these efforts require significant management attention and financial resources 
we may not be able to successfully penetrate international markets or  if we do  we may not be able to grow or to maintain adequate profit margins in these markets 
because of the complex nature of our international expansion  it may adversely affect our business and operating results 
international expansion and sales are subject to many risks  including the following limited development of an international market for our software and services  expanding and training our international sales force and support operations  higher costs of employment in certain international geographies  difficulties in producing localized versions of our products  political and economic instability  potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in foreign countries  import and export restrictions and tariffs  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  currency fluctuations  cultural differences which may affect workforce performance and sales processes  difficulties and expenses associated with complying with a variety of foreign laws  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
as we further expand our operations outside the united states  we will also face new competitors and competitive environments 
in addition to the risks associated with our domestic competitors  foreign competitors may pose an even greater risk  because they may possess a better understanding of their local markets and have better working relationships with local infrastructure providers and others 
in particular  because telephone protocols and standards are unique to each country  local competitors will have more experience with  and may have a competitive advantage in  these markets 
we may not be able to obtain similar levels of knowledge  which could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage 
in addition  we have limited experience in developing local language versions of our products or in marketing our products to international customers 
we may not be able to successfully translate  market  sell  and deliver our products internationally 
if we are unable to maintain a productive direct sales force  our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we believe that our future success will depend on maintaining a productive direct sales force 
historically  it has taken us up to six months to train new sales personnel before they reach an acceptable level of productivity 
we have also experienced difficulty in recruiting sales personnel with experience in computer and telephone integration technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to manage turnover and hire new sales personnel to meet our needs 
if the personnel we hire are less qualified than we expect  it may take us more time to train them before they reach an acceptable level of productivity  which could increase our costs and impact our revenue 
if we are unable to expand the distribution of our products through indirect sales channels  our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our strategy is to continue to increase the proportion of customers served through indirect sales channels  such as select resellers and a variety of strategic marketing alliances 
product revenue from our indirect sales channel represented approximately and of total product revenue in and we expect revenue from our indirect sales channel and  accordingly  our dependence on distribution partners  to increase as we establish relationships with companies to resell our software worldwide 
in connection with our acquisition of blue pumpkin  we acquired several reseller relationships with provisions that grant exclusive rights to market some of our products 
if we are not successful in removing these contractual provisions  our ability to grow in the affected geographies  including the united kingdom  may be limited 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain productive relationships with our current partners  or that we will be able to establish similar relationships with additional resellers on a timely basis  if at all 
some resellers with which we do business have similar  and often more established  relationships with our competitors  and may recommend the products and services of our competitors to customers instead of our software and services 
we cannot provide assurance that these distribution partners will devote adequate resources to selling our software and services or that our resellers may not learn about our products and the market for our software and services and develop and sell competing products and services 
as a result  our relationships with resellers could lead to increased competition for us 
intense competition in our business could adversely affect our revenue  profitability and market share 
the market for products that record customer interactions  analyze performance and or provide electronic learning is intensely competitive  evolving and is subject to rapid changes in technology 
we believe our principal competitors include  but are not limited to quality monitoring suppliers to the contact center industry  traditional call logging vendors  workforce management  forecasting and scheduling vendors to the call center industry electronic learning vendors  business analytics vendors  large telecom solution providers  systems integrators and consulting firms  and new  larger and more established entities that may acquire  invest in or form joint ventures with providers of recording or performance enhancing software solutions 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  more established business relationships  larger customer bases  a broader range of products and services  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  personnel  management  service  support and other resources than we do 
as a result  our current and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take better advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities  devote greater resources to marketing and selling their products and services and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
we cannot assure you that our current or potential competitors will not develop products comparable or superior in terms of price and performance features to those developed by us 
in addition  many of our competitors market their products through resellers and companies that integrate their technology and products with those of the competitor 
these resellers and technology partners often have strong business relationships with our customers and potential customers 
for example  some of our competitors have better and more long standing relationships than we do with telephone switch vendors 
our competitors may use these business relationships to market and sell their products and compete for potential customers 
it is also possible that resellers or technology partners may acquire or be acquired by one or more of our competitors  which would further solidify their business relationships 
we expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter our market and as new products  services and technologies are introduced 
increased competition may result in price reductions  lower gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our heavy reliance on sales of our equality balance  equality evaluation and equality contactstore products exposes us to risks of obsolescence due to changes in competitive product offerings 
we continue to derive a substantial portion of our product revenues from sales of our equality balance  equality evaluation and equality contactstore software 
we expect revenue from these products to continue to account for most of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  any factors affecting the markets for these products  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that the market will continue to demand our current products or that we will be successful in marketing any new or enhanced products 
if our competitors release new products that are superior to our products in performance or price  demand for our products may decline 
a decline in demand for our products as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would reduce our total revenues and harm our ability to maintain profitability 
if we fail to develop new software or improve our existing software  we may not be able to remain competitive 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our existing products could be rendered obsolete if we fail to continue to advance our technology 
we have also found that the technological life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate  partially because of changing demands of our customers 
we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance our current product line while we concurrently develop and introduce new products that keep pace with competitive and technological developments 
these developments require us to continue to make substantial product development investments 
although we are presently developing a number of product enhancements to our product suites  we cannot assure you that these enhancements will be completed on a timely basis or gain customer acceptance 
in addition  failure to develop new software or improve existing software products may impact our ability to maintain our maintenance renewal rate which could have a material impact on our revenue 
if our software development activities in the asia pacific region are not successful  we may not be able to meet our development schedules 
during  we significantly expanded our software development capabilities in the asia pacific region in order to optimize available research and development resources and better meet development timeframes 
we have limited experience with remote software development activities 
accordingly  there are a number of risks associated with this activity  including delays or product errors due to miscommunication between our local development organization and the remote development personnel affected by time  distance and language differences  scheduling delays due to lengthy ramp up time for our new development personnel  products produced in the asia pacific region that fail to meet our quality requirements  high voluntary personnel turnover  and foreign employment and labor laws with which we are not familiar 
our inability to meet development schedules because of our reliance on developers in the asia pacific region may affect our ability to enhance our current product line or introduce new products  which would have a material adverse affect on our financial results and could harm our reputation 
the loss of key development personnel could have a material adverse effect on our product development process and adversely affect future product revenues 
our liability to customers may be substantial if our products fail to perform properly 
our software is used in a complex operating environment that requires its integration with computer and telephone networks and other business software applications 
if our products fail to function as required  we may be subject to claims for substantial damages 
courts may not enforce provisions in our contracts that would limit our liability or otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
although we maintain general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions  this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover claims against us 
in addition  our insurer may disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
if claims exceeding the available insurance coverage are successfully asserted against us  or our insurer imposes premium increases  large deductibles or co insurance requirements on us  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our software may contain undetected errors or bugs  resulting in harm to our reputation and operating results 
software products as complex as those offered by us might contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or when new versions are released 
we cannot assure you  despite testing by us and by current and prospective customers  that errors will not be found in new products or product enhancements after commercial release 
any errors found may cause substantial harm to our reputation and result in additional unplanned expenses to remedy any defects as well as a loss in revenue 
if our advanced compliance recording applications fail to record of our customers interactions  we may be subject to liability and our reputation may be harmed 
through our acquisition of eyretel  we have extended our product line to include advanced compliance recording applications and related services 
many of our eyretel customers use these applications to record and store interactions with customers to provide back up and verification of transactions and to guard against risks posed by lost or misinterpreted voice communications 
these customers rely on our applications to record  store and retrieve voice data in a timely  reliable and efficient manner 
if our applications fail to record of our customers interactions or our customers are unable to retrieve the recordings when necessary  we may be subject to liability and our reputation may be harmed 
if we are unable to maintain the security of our systems  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
the occurrence or perception of security breaches in the operation of our business or by third parties using our products could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
our customers use our products to compile and analyze highly sensitive or confidential information 
we may come into contact with such information or data when we perform support or maintenance functions for our customers 
while we have internal policies and procedures for employees performing these functions  the perception that we have improperly handled sensitive  confidential information could have a negative effect on our business 
if  in handling this information  we fail to comply with privacy or security laws  we could incur civil liability to government agencies  customers and individuals whose privacy is compromised 
if personal information is received or used from sources outside the us  we could be subject to civil  administrative or criminal liability under the laws of other countries 
in addition  while we implement sophisticated security measures  third parties may attempt to breach our security or inappropriately use our products through computer viruses  electronic break ins and other disruptions 
if successful  confidential information may be improperly obtained and we may be subject to lawsuits and other liability 
any internal or external security breaches could harm our reputation  and even the perception of security risks  whether or not valid  could inhibit market acceptance of our products 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 
we may experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
moreover  in locations where we price our products in us dollars  our sales could be affected adversely by declines in foreign currencies relative to the dollar  thereby making our products more expensive in local currencies 
in locations  where we sell our products in local currencies  we could be competitively unable to increase our prices to reflect fluctuations in exchange rates 
we cannot predict the impact that future exchange rate fluctuations may have on our results 
certain provisions in agreements that we have entered into may expose us to liability for breach that is not limited in amount by the terms of the contract 
certain contract provisions  principally confidentiality and indemnification obligations in certain of our license agreements  could expose us to risks of loss that  in some cases  are not limited by contract to a specified maximum amount 
if we fail to perform to the standards required by these contracts  we could be subject to additional liability and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
there have been no material losses to date as a result of any such contractual provisions 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  third parties may use our technology for their own benefit 
our success and ability to compete depends to a significant degree upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
these measures may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary rights  and we cannot be certain that third parties will not misappropriate our technology and use it for their own benefit 
also  most of these protections do not preclude our competitors from independently developing products with functionality or features substantially equivalent or superior to our software 
any infringement of our proprietary rights could negatively impact our future operating results 
as of december   we had seven registered trademarks  one trademark application pending in the us  five us and three international patents  and patent applications pending in the us and five patent applications pending internationally 
there is no guarantee that our pending applications will result in issued trademarks or patents or  if issued  that they will provide us with any competitive advantage 
we cannot assure you that we will file further patent or trademark applications  that any future applications will be approved  that any existing or future patents  trademarks or copyrights will adequately protect our intellectual property or that any existing or future patents  trademarks or copyrights will not be challenged by third parties 
we are aware of certain uses  us trademark registrations  and us trademark applications for our equality trademark and its variations that predate our use  and the april issuance of the us registration for our trademark equality 
it is possible that an owner of legal rights resulting from prior use  registrations  or applications will bring legal action to challenge our registration of and or our use of the trademark equality  and may also seek compensation for damages resulting from our use this trademark 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our registration of this trademark will be undisturbed  or that this use will not result in liability for trademark infringement  trademark dilution  and or unfair competition 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively impact our future operating results 
claims by other companies that our software infringes their intellectual property could require us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from selling our software or services 
it is possible that third parties will claim that we have infringed their current or future products 
we expect that we and other participants in our industry will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of competitors and products grows 
any claims  with or without merit  which is generally uninsurable could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  require us to reengineer or redevelop our software  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could negatively impact our operating results 
any efforts to reengineer our software or obtain licenses from third parties may not be successful  could be extremely costly and would likely divert valuable management and product development resources 
for example  depending on the outcome of lawsuits involving knowlagent and nice as described in note  legal proceedings of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we may be required to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms  to stop selling or redesign our products at issue  or to pay damages or satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers 
in addition  we cannot assure you that legal action claiming patent infringement will not be commenced against us  or that we would prevail in litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in patent litigation 
in addition  users of our software may become subject to claims if our software is alleged to infringe the intellectual property of others 
these software users could attempt to hold us responsible for these claims and any resulting harm they suffer 
if a patent claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign to avoid infringement  we may be prevented from distributing our software or required to incur significant expense and delay in developing non infringing software 
such a result would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of our acquisition of blue pumpkin  we are subject to pending patent and employment lawsuits  which  if determined adversely to us  may cause our business to suffer 
in january  iex corporation filed a lawsuit against blue pumpkin in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas  sherman division  alleging that blue pumpkin infringed iex corporation s iex us patent no 
 the patent by making and selling certain workforce management and call routing software products  including blue pumpkin s prime time skills and prime time enterprise products 
iex is seeking to recover actual damages  an award of treble damages pursuant to usc  and an award of prejudgment interest  costs  and attorney s fees 
iex is also seeking an injunction against blue pumpkin s making or selling the products that iex claims infringe its patent 
on october   the district court granted blue pumpkin summary judgment of non infringement 
that day  the district court dismissed the remainder of the case 
iex appealed the district court s summary judgment ruling to the court of appeals for the federal circuit 
on february   the federal circuit reversed in part the district court s summary judgment ruling and remanded the action to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the federal circuit s analysis 
blue pumpkin is not yet on a schedule before the district court 
we are unable to assess the impact  if any  on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  steven osborn  a former salesman for blue pumpkin  filed a complaint against blue pumpkin in the united states district court for the northern district of texas alleging fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation  breach of contract  quantum meruit  and unjust enrichment  relating to the amount of commissions he earned on a contract he effectuated for blue pumpkin 
blue pumpkin has filed for summary judgment and the motion is currently pending 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of this litigation at this time 
regardless of the merit of these claims  they can be time consuming and costly 
while we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur  there exists the remote possibility of a material adverse impact on our net income 
our estimate of the potential impact from these legal proceedings on our financial position or results of operations could change in the future 
if we are unable to maintain the compatibility of our software with certain other products and technologies  our future business would be adversely affected 
our software must integrate with software and hardware solutions provided by a number of our existing and potential competitors 
for example  our products must integrate with phone switches made by the telephone switch vendors and computer telephony software applications offered by other software providers 
these competitors or their business partners could alter their products so that our software no longer integrates well with them  or they could delay or deny our access to software releases that allow us to timely adapt our software to integrate with their products 
if we cannot adapt our software to changes in necessary technology  it may significantly impair our ability to compete effectively  particularly if our software must integrate with the software and hardware solutions of our competitors 
if our professional services employees do not provide installation services effectively and efficiently  our customers may not use our installation services or may stop using our software 
our customers ordinarily purchase installation  training and maintenance services together with our products 
the functionality of our products are not dependent on our installation and training services 
we generate a material part of our revenues from these services 
we believe that the speed and quality of installation services are competitive factors in our industry 
if our installation services are not satisfactory to our customers  the customers may choose not to use our installation services or they may not license our software in the future 
as a result  we would lose licensing and services revenue  and it could harm our reputation 
we may make acquisitions or investments that are not successful and that adversely affect our ongoing operations 
we may acquire or make investments in companies  products  services and technologies that we believe complement our business and assist us in quickly bringing new products to market 
we have limited experience in making acquisitions and investments 
as a result  our ability to identify and evaluate prospects  complete acquisitions and properly manage the integration of businesses is relatively unproven 
if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments  it may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in making or attempting to make acquisitions or investments  we face a number of risks  including identifying suitable candidates  performing appropriate due diligence  identifying potential liabilities and negotiating acceptable terms  reducing our working capital and hindering our ability to expand or maintain our business  if we make acquisitions using cash  the potential distraction of our management  diversion of our resources and disruption of our business  retaining and motivating key employees of the acquired companies  managing operations that are distant from our current headquarters and operations  entering into geographic markets in which we have little or no prior experience  competing for acquisition opportunities with competitors that are larger than we are or have greater financial and other resources than we have  accurately forecasting the financial impact of a transaction  assuming liabilities of acquired companies  including litigation related to the operation of the business prior to the acquisition  maintaining good relations with the customers and suppliers of the acquired company  and effectively integrating acquired companies and achieving expected synergies 
if we need additional financing to maintain or expand our business  it may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
although we believe our current cash and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months and the foreseeable future  we may need additional funds to expand or meet all of our operating needs 
if we need additional financing  we cannot be certain that it will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt  the ownership interest of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and any additional equity securities we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our stockholders 
also  the terms of any additional financing we obtain may significantly limit our future financing and operating activities 
if we need funds and cannot obtain them on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop and enhance our software to remain competitive  take advantage of future opportunities  such as acquisitions  respond to changing customer needs and our competitors innovations  or attract and retain qualified key personnel 
any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial condition and limit our growth 
the loss of third party hardware suppliers could harm our business 
a number of customers expect us to source hardware to support the implementation of our software 
we are working towards reducing the amount of hardware sales in the future and have transferred the fulfillment of hardware orders to third party distributors 
thus  we are largely dependent on third parties for the supply of hardware components to our customers 
if these hardware distributors experience financial  operational or quality assurance difficulties  or if there is any other disruption in our relationships  we may be required to locate alternative hardware sources 
we are subject to the following risks due to our hardware distribution system cancellations of orders due to unavailability of hardware  increased hardware prices  which may make our products less attractive  and additional development expense to modify our products to work with new hardware configurations 
even if we and or our distributors are successful in locating alternative sources of supply  alternative suppliers could increase prices significantly 
in addition  alternative components may malfunction or interact with existing components in unexpected ways 
the use of new suppliers and the modification of our products to function with new systems would require testing and may require further modifications  which may result in additional expense  diversion of management attention and other resources  inability to fulfill customer orders or delay in fulfillment  reduction in quality and reliability  customer dissatisfaction  and other adverse effects on our reputation  business and operating results 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and stock price 
the sarbanes oxley act of imposes new duties on us and our executives  directors  attorneys and independent registered public accountants 
our efforts to comply with the requirements of section have resulted in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities  and we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in investigation and or sanctions by regulatory authorities  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results  investor confidence in our reported financial information  and the market price of our common stock 
our stock price has been volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any announcement with respect to any adverse variance in revenue or earnings from levels generally expected by securities analysts or investors could have a significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our competitors or third parties  changing conditions in the customer relationship management software market  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  loss of a major customer  additions or departures of key personnel  changes in estimates by securities analysts  announcements of extraordinary events  such as acquisitions or litigation  or general economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we issued million new shares and granted approximately  options to purchase shares of our common stock  which will result in dilution to our existing stockholders and may cause our stock price to decline 
as part of the merger consideration in our recent acquisition of blue pumpkin  we issued a total of million shares of common stock to blue pumpkin shareholders  which increased our total outstanding common stock by approximately  we also issued options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition 
the issuance of a significant amount of additional shares of common stock results in dilution to our existing shareholders and reduces our earnings per share  which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
a significant amount of common stock coming on the market at any given time could result in a decline in the price of our common stock or increased volatility 
our performance may be negatively affected by macro economic or other external influences 
beginning in  a declining united states economy began to adversely affect the performance of many businesses  especially within the technology sector 
we are a technology company selling technology based solutions with total pricing  including software and services that in some cases exceed million 
reductions in the capital budgets of our customers and prospective customers had an adverse impact on our ability to sell our solutions 
until late in  we continued to experience effects from a weak spending environment for information technology in both the united states and europe  in the form of delayed and cancelled buying decisions by customers for our software  services and hardware  deferrals by customers of service engagements previously scheduled and pressure by our customers and competitors to discount our offerings 
if the current improvements now being seen in the general business climate do not continue  this would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
government regulation of telephone and internet monitoring could cause a decline in the use of our software  result in increased expenses for us or subject our customers and us to liability 
as the telecommunications industry continues to evolve  state  federal and foreign governments including supranational governmental organizations such as the european union may increasingly regulate the monitoring of telecommunications and telephone and internet monitoring and recording products  such as our software 
we believe that increases in regulation could come in the form of a number of different kinds of regulations  including regulations regarding privacy  protection of personal information and employment 
for example  the state of california recently enacted the database security breach act  which requires any business that suffers a computer security breach to immediately notify customers in california if personal information has been compromised 
the adoption of any new regulations or changes to existing regulations could cause a decline in the use of our software and could result in increased expense for us  particularly if we are required to modify our software to accommodate these regulations 
moreover  these regulations could subject our customers or us to liability 
whether or not these regulations are adopted  if we do not adequately address the privacy concerns of consumers  companies may be hesitant to use our software 
if any of these events occur  it could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our ability to effectively manage and grow our business would suffer 
our success greatly depends on our ability to hire  train  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly in sales  marketing  research and development  service and support 
we face significant competition for individuals with the skills required to perform the services we offer 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel or if we experience high personnel turnover  it could prevent us from effectively managing and expanding our business 
our success also depends upon the continued service of our executive officers  particularly our chairman and chief executive officer  david gould  and our president and chief operating officer  nick discombe 
we have employment agreements with mr 
gould and mr 
discombe and limited non compete agreements with most of our other executive officers 
however  any of our executive officers and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
the loss of the services of our executive officers or other key personnel  particularly if lost to competitors  could materially and adversely affect our business 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware law  may inhibit a takeover of our company  which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our securities 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware law  contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company 
for example  our stockholders cannot take action by written consent or call a special meeting to remove our board of directors 
in addition  our directors serve for staggered terms  which makes it difficult to remove all our directors at once 
further  in october  our board of directors approved  and we have implemented  a stockholder rights plan which has the effect of causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by the board of directors 
these anti takeover provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of our company or a change in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our securities
