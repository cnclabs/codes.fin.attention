item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of watchguard s financial condition and operating results 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
references to we  our and us in this annual report refer to watchguard technologies  inc and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
overview we are a leading provider of network security solutions designed to protect small to medium sized enterprises  or smes  that use the internet for e commerce and secure communications 
we provide smes worldwide with integrated and expandable network security solutions employing multi layered defenses designed to protect not only against existing threats  but against future threats  in an intelligent way backed by an intuitive user interface and the expert guidance and support of our livesecurity service 
with the risk that threats and attacks will compromise multiple access points in a corporate network  an effective security solution requires more layers of defense than just firewalls for access control and virtual private networks  or vpns  for secure communications 
a security solution that integrates multiple layers of defense  however  must do so efficiently to preserve performance and remain flexible enough to adapt to future threats and attacks in the evolving security landscape 
thousands of enterprises worldwide use our award winning products and services to meet these requirements 
the core of our products and services is our family of integrated  expandable firebox x security solutions 
we offer firewall protection and intrusion prevention technology for access control  virtual private networking for secure communications  content and spam filtering  gateway and desktop anti virus protection and vulnerability assessment services

our market spans the sme market  from smaller sized companies  for which ease of use is a primary requirement  to medium sized companies  including those with high speed connections supporting vpns between the corporate headquarters and geographically dispersed branch offices  for which performance  scalability and networking features are key requirements 
our security solutions also give enterprises a security management choice 
an enterprise can manage its own internet security with our product offerings or outsource its security management to an internet service provider or other managed service provider implementing our managed security solutions 
for the service provider  our technology improves the economics of managed security services through a scalable delivery platform that enables the service provider to remotely configure and manage thousands of customer sites quickly and easily 
we sell our network security solutions indirectly to end users through a network that includes thousands of distributors and resellers  and we have customers located in over countries 
we also sell directly and indirectly to a number of service providers that implement our managed security solution and resell to end users 
as of december   we had shipped over  of our security appliances 
since january  we have continued to invest heavily in the development of our products as follows in march  we introduced the firebox s and firebox stcvpn firewall and vpn network security appliances for small businesses  remote offices and telecommuters  which were fully localized for the japanese market 
in march  we introduced the firebox vl  an addition to our line of firebox vclass security appliances 
the new product is designed to provide mid size enterprises with firewall vpn performance and scalability superior to other solutions in the same price range 

table of contents in march  we introduced the firebox  an addition to our firebox iii family of sophisticated  easy to manage security solutions for smes 
the new product is a hardened firewall appliance for small businesses requiring perimeter security  mobile user vpn support and web content control 
in march  we introduced the firebox v  which extended our line of high performance firebox vclass security solutions 
the new product was designed to eliminate the need for multiple appliances in environments requiring multi gigabit throughput  thereby providing a cost effective  easy to implement solution for distributed enterprises and service providers

in december  we made available the watchguard gateway antivirus for email for our firebox x line of integrated  upgradeable security appliances 
this robust signature based solution  combined with our existing deep application inspection capability  is designed to provide comprehensive security against email borne threats at an affordable cost 
in december  we extended the firebox x edge line with a wireless version offering secure g wireless connection  and enhanced the edge software for wired and wireless to include wan wan failover and wan modem failover for greater reliability 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including those related to revenue recognition  including sales returns and allowances  provision for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  restructuring reserves  and analysis for impairment of goodwill and other long lived intangible assets 

table of contents we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are complex 
although we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
the complexity of the revenue recognition rules and estimates inherent in the revenue recognition process makes revenue results difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenues or delay in recognizing revenues could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
we generate revenues through sales of products and service subscriptions indirectly through our distribution network at a discount from list price  sales of products and service subscriptions to our service provider customers at volume pricing rates  and sales of service subscription renewals directly to end users  generally at the manufacturer s suggested retail price 
product revenues  net of sales returns  allowances and promotions  include sales of our firebox products  bundling our security appliances and perpetual software licenses as part of our security solution  revenues from license sales of software options  such as user expansion  software management modules and the license portion of subscriptions  and revenues from sales of our network operations center security suite software license as part of our managed security solution 
revenues from products are generally recognized upon delivery if persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for undelivered elements of the arrangement has been established 
while we generally recognize product revenues upon shipment  revenues from some distribution arrangements where the distributor has unlimited stock return and rotation rights are not recognized until the distributors sell the products to their customers 
service revenues primarily include the initial fees for our livesecurity service subscriptions  which have periods ranging from days to one year and are sold as part of our security solutions  and for livesecurity service subscription renewals  which have periods ranging from nine months to two years  from our enterprise customers and end users 
these service fees provide our customers access to our livesecurity service for product updates  security threat responses  general security information and technical support 
these service fees also enable our service provider customers access to the livesecurity service and the ability to manage and update a specific number of their customers security appliances 
service subscription revenues are recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the subscription period 
when service fees are bundled with the sales of our products in multiple element arrangements  the elements of those arrangements are unbundled using our objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered 
table of contents elements represented by our customary pricing for each element when sold in separate transactions 
since customers receive the services over a period of time  watchguard determines the fair value of the service portion of the arrangement as an undelivered element  based on the renewal price of the service 
changes in the composition of such multiple element arrangements  our ability to identify the existence of the vendor specific objective evidence for the elements in the arrangement or our ability to estimate the fair value of elements in existing arrangements or new service offerings could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
we have established allowances for estimated returns and pricing protection rights 
we have also established an allowance for promotional rebates that may be earned by our customers 
we estimate these allowances and adjust them periodically based on historical rates of returns and allowances  as well as the expected effect of current promotional programs and new product introductions 
we estimate the allowance for promotional rebates based on the maximum amounts potentially available to the customers  unless we have accumulated sufficient historic evidence for individual customers with respect to their realization of rebates 
if new or expanded promotional programs are introduced  or new products are announced  additional allowances will be required 
alternatively  if actual promotional rebates fall below maximum exposure levels  we will reduce the allowances and recognize additional revenue 
provision for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables  including the probability of collection and the creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we write our inventories down to estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the introduction of new products that replace existing products  technological advances  and variation in market trends or customer preferences could  however  significantly affect these estimates and result in additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
restructuring during and we implemented two restructuring plans and recorded significant accruals related to those restructuring plans 
these accruals included estimates related to the abandonment of excess facilities 
we later adjusted  as required  the restructuring accruals due to continued poor real estate market conditions in the areas where these excess facilities are located 
the actual costs related to the restructuring may differ from our estimate if it takes us longer than expected to find suitable tenants for excess facilities or if there are further changes in the real estate market in those areas where excess facilities are located 
any additional adjustments resulting from these factors could have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
accounting for goodwill and other long lived intangible assets our business acquisitions have resulted in  and future acquisitions typically will result in  the recording of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including capitalized technology and other definite lived intangible assets 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
application of the goodwill impairment test may 
table of contents require judgments  including those inherent in the determination of fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides and the resulting determination of the implicit value of the goodwill 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value 
separable intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives typically ranging between three and five years 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  these assets are also periodically reviewed for the existence of facts and circumstances  both internal and external  which may suggest potential impairment 
the determination of whether these intangible assets are impaired involves significant judgments based on short and long term projections of future performance 
certain of these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding our ability to continue to develop and ultimately to commercialize the products based on these intangible assets  as well as our projections of future cash flows from these products 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in an impairment charge to our operating expenses  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
generally  the approach described in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the requirements of sfas r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june   with early adoption of the standard permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
sfas r allows public companies to recognize compensation expense using either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method  which permits entities to restate based on amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures for a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are currently evaluating pricing models and the transition provisions of this standard 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our operating results 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements

years ended december  and revenues year ended december  percent increase revenues in thousands product service total revenues as of total revenues product service total 
table of contents we categorize our revenues into three geographic regions the americas  europe middle east africa  or emea  and asia pacific  or apac 
revenue information by geographic region  in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  was as follows year ended december  percent increase revenues in thousands americas emea apac total revenues as of total revenues americas emea apac total revenue information for countries representing more than of total revenues  in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  was as follows year ended december  percent increase decrease revenues in thousands united states united kingdom revenues as of total revenues united states united kingdom country s information is based on destination of original shipments 
revenue information for customers representing more than of total revenues  in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  was as follows year ended december  percent increase revenues in thousands tech data ingram micro revenues as of total revenues tech data ingram micro the dollar and percentage increase in product revenues for  as compared to  primarily reflects unit shipments of our firebox x and firebox x edge product lines  partially offset by a reduction in shipments and increased discounts on our firebox iii and firebox soho product lines and a reduction in shipments of our firebox vclass product line during the current year 
our new firebox x and firebox x edge product lines were introduced in february and august  respectively 
revenues from our firebox iii product line 
table of contents decreased in  as these products are being replaced by comparable new firebox x products 
lower revenues from our firebox soho product line is primarily due to introduction of the new firebox x edge line in from a regional standpoint  revenues increased for both the americas market and the international markets 
revenues from the americas and the emea markets increased at a higher rate than revenues from the apac market during  primarily due to our realignment efforts in japan taking longer than anticipated and delays in obtaining import licenses permitting the sale of certain of our products into china 
given the continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty and constrained corporate information technology spending  it is difficult to predict revenue levels in future quarters  which may decline or fluctuate more than they have historically 
we recognize revenue from a majority of our channel customers when we sell product to them the sell in method rather than when they in turn sell the product to their end customers the sell through method 
due to changes in contractual obligations with certain channel customers in north america  australia and new zealand and the need to offer promotional programs to give us the flexibility in those markets to be more competitive  responsive and effective  we will be required to recognize revenue on a sell through method rather than a sell in method for these customers 
the contractual changes and the resulting conversion of these customers from a sell in method to a sell through method of revenue recognition will occur in the first quarter of if we are successful in achieving our desired results  we will evaluate taking similar measures with customers in other parts of the world 
when a channel customer is converted from a sell in method to a sell through method of revenue recognition  revenue can no longer be recognized when product is sold to the channel customer  and revenue from products already in that channel customer s inventory and for which revenue was already recognized by us cannot be recognized when those products are sold through to end customers 
no revenue can therefore be recognized from a converted channel customer until after the inventory existing at the time of the conversion is sold through to end customers 
based on current channel inventory levels and our projections of sales to end customers  we estimate that this conversion will have a million to million adverse effect  in the aggregate  on our revenues reported in the first quarter of  with the possibility of some carryover to the second quarter of if all of the previously recognized sales into the channel customer s inventory are not depleted by the end of the first quarter of upon completion of this conversion of channel customers in north america  australia and new zealand  we expect that business conducted on a sell through method will generate approximately to of our total revenues 
to the extent additional channel customers are converted  there will be an adverse effect on revenues for the quarter in which those conversions take place  with the magnitude depending on the inventory levels in those channel partners at the time of conversion 
to recognize revenue on a sell through method from a channel customer  we will need to establish that we can obtain adequate reporting on inventory levels from that channel customer to determine how much of our product has been sold to the end customers of that channel customer 
if we are unable to obtain such reporting  our ability to recognize revenue from such channel customers could be materially adversely affected and our financial results would be harmed 
service revenues consist of revenues recognized from initial fees for our livesecurity service subscriptions bundled with a hardware product sale  and revenues recognized for subscription renewals sold to the existing customer base 
the dollar increase in service revenues for  as compared to  is primarily due to growth of our installed customer base  resulting in a greater number of livesecurity service renewals  as well as initial purchases of new subscription based products 
this increase is partially offset by  of service revenues in the first quarter of generated from livesecurity services provided through certain managed security customers to end users in prior periods  but that were identified by watchguard  through a license compliance initiative  as being previously unreported to watchguard by those customers 
service revenues recognized from initial livesecurity service subscription fees are generally related to product shipments in preceding quarters  while revenues recognized from livesecurity service renewals depend on the existing customer base and the percentage of those customers eligible for renewal that elect to renew their subscriptions 
a decline in product shipments will result in lower initial livesecurity service subscriptions 
table of contents bundled with the products  while an increase in our installed customer base  even from declining product shipments  will increase the number of customers with the opportunity to renew their livesecurity service subscriptions 
due to these factors  it is difficult to predict future service revenue levels 
cost of revenues and gross margin year ended december  percent increase decrease cost of revenues in thousands product service total cost of revenues as of total revenues product service total cost of revenues as of related revenue component product service gross margin in thousands product service total gross margin as of related revenue component product service total gross margins are affected by various factors  including the volume discount level offered to our customers  the cost of our hardware appliances including components and labor  costs of excess and obsolete inventory  lower of cost or market assessment of inventory carrying value  fixed manufacturing overhead  the mix of product and service sales which include hardware and software products and livesecurity service subscriptions  the cost of royalties associated with our products  promotional programs  and the cost of our technical support organization and livesecurity service 
cost of product revenues includes the cost of manufacturing our security appliances  distribution operations  product packaging  third party product licensing fees and provisions for inventory reserves and warranty 
the dollar increase in cost of product revenues for  as compared to  was primarily due to increased product volumes associated with our firebox x product lines  reflecting introduction of our firebox x and firebox x edge product lines in february and august  respectively 
the increase also reflects higher manufacturing costs  due to selected stock upgrades and refurbishing  and higher costs associated with freight and other distribution activities  reflecting increased demand for our firebox x product line 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in costs of excess and obsolete inventory 
the provision for inventory reserves decreased from million in to million in the provision includes a write down of our rapidstream secured by check point brand products  a subset of the products and technology obtained as a result of our april acquisition of rapidstream  inc increased focus on our core 
table of contents market of smes  combined with historically poor sales performance  resulted in curtailment of further marketing and development of this brand 
the decrease in represents the disposition of the majority of the related inventory 
product gross margins increased in absolute dollars for  as compared to  primarily due to unit volume growth and a reduction in our provision for inventory reserves  partially offset by increased manufacturing costs as described above 
the decline in product gross margins as a percentage of product revenues was primarily the result of competitive pricing in the marketplace and the higher manufacturing costs as described above 
competitive pricing factors included increased rebate and promotional activity during on new product and service introductions  together with increased discounting activity associated with our existing firebox iii and soho product lines 
cost of service revenues includes the costs of our technical support organization and costs associated with our livesecurity service 
cost of service revenues decreased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of related revenues for  as compared to  resulting in a corresponding increase in service gross margins as a percentage of related revenues 
the dollar decrease in service costs is primarily the result of cost savings achieved after transitioning first level customer support services to a lower cost third party provider in the fourth quarter of service gross margins increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of service revenues for  as compared to  reflecting incremental software maintenance subscriptions year over year and cost savings achieved through outsourcing certain customer support services in late this increase was partially offset by  of service revenue that was recognized in the first quarter of  without significant additional costs  from our license compliance initiative  discussed above in conjunction with service revenues 
we expect service costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as our user base expands 
service costs and margins could differ materially from those anticipated  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
forecasting future gross margins is difficult  as our gross margins could be adversely affected in the future by heightened sales price competition  increased material costs  key component shortages and excess and obsolete inventory charges 
our margins could also be negatively affected by continued economic uncertainty  which could result in downward pressure on the prices of technology based products 
operating expenses sales and marketing year ended december  percent increase sales and marketing expenses in thousands sales and marketing expenses as of total revenues sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and employee related expenses and certain variable marketing expenses  including distributor promotional costs  public relations costs  marketing collateral  trade shows  advertising expenses  direct marketing and costs of demo units 
sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars for  as compared to  primarily due to the following increased spending on information technology support costs for our marketing and sales departments in due to consolidation of our customer facing applications and databases and their migration onto more scalable and extensible application platforms 

table of contents higher variable spending on marketing related activities in  largely advertising and market development costs incurred to gain brand awareness of the firebox x and firebox x edge product lines 
sales and marketing expenses declined as a percentage of revenues in  as compared to  as we focused on improving the productivity of our sales channels and the efficiency of our marketing campaigns 
for  we expect a modest decrease in our sales and marketing expenses in comparison to levels incurred in should our revenues improve or stay flat  we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
our actual sales and marketing expenses could differ materially from those anticipated  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
research and development year ended december  percent decrease research and development expenses in thousands research and development expenses as of total revenues research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products  product integration efforts and quality assurance activities 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  costs of noncapitalized equipment  software tools  our security appliance prototypes and certification procedures  payments to designers and contractors and depreciation of capital equipment and software 
research and development expenses decreased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for  as compared to  primarily due to the following a reduction in outsourced development and certification costs during  reflecting higher costs incurred in those areas in in connection with the evaluation for certification of the firebox vclass product line and in connection with our effort to integrate technology obtained in the rapidstream acquisition 
lower depreciation expenses and costs of information technology in support of research and development in  primarily due to cost containment for research and development capital expenditures in and and the expiration of depreciation on earlier purchases 
for  we anticipate increased spending on our research and development activities  in absolute dollar terms  in comparison to levels incurred in we intend to continue to fund our research and development efforts and hire the necessary personnel in order to attempt to meet the changing requirements of our customers  to provide for continued introduction of new products as technology advances and to enhance and expand our current product offerings 
significant efforts are currently underway aimed at converging software codes associated with our original software code base and the software networking technology obtained in the rapidstream acquisition 
research and development expenses may vary significantly quarter over quarter due to inherent uncertainties in the timing of certain development costs 
we expect to continue to invest in key areas aimed at the development of new generations of our products  the further extension of our existing product lines and the development of future technologies 
our actual research and development expenses could differ materially from those anticipated  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

table of contents general and administrative year ended december  percent increase general and administrative expenses in thousands general and administrative expenses as of total revenues general and administrative expenses include costs of executive  human resource  finance and administrative support functions  provisions for uncollectible accounts  costs of legal and accounting professional services  and director and officer insurance 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars for  as compared to the dollar increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to a substantial increase in accounting fees in  as a result of annual audit fees and compliance with regulatory requirements related to the sarbanes oxley act of general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  remained comparable in and for  we expect a slight increase in general and administrative expenses compared to levels incurred in the anticipated increase is primarily due to incremental costs associated with the addition of senior management and other administrative personnel that joined us in but were not employed for the entire year  partially offset by a reduction in accounting and other fees associated with regulatory requirements related to compliance with sarbanes oxley 
our actual general and administrative expenses could differ materially from those anticipated  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expenses allocated by functional operating expense category were as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  percent decrease sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation stock based compensation expenses arise primarily from amortization of previously deferred stock based compensation over the vesting periods of common stock subject to repurchase and to stock options 
deferred stock based compensation is initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity in the amount of the excess of the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant over the exercise price of options and also in the amount of the fair value of temporarily restricted common stock that we issued in connection with our april acquisition of rapidstream that is subject to repurchase 
in addition  deferred stock based compensation is recorded for the fair value of stock options granted to consultants 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized into expense over the relevant vesting periods using the accelerated method 
for  we expect a significant increase in stock based compensation expense compared to levels incurred in the anticipated increase reflects the impact of adoption of sfas r in the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents amortization of other intangible assets acquired amortization of other intangible assets acquired in and consisted primarily of amortization of capitalized technology obtained in our acquisition of rapidstream in this technology is expected to be fully amortized by march  amortization expense in also included amortization of capitalized technology related to our acquisition of qiave technologies corporation in  which was fully amortized by the end of we amortize our intangible assets acquired on a straight line basis over an expected useful life of five years 
amortization of other intangible assets acquired was for and million for the decrease in amortization of other intangible assets acquired in  as compared to  is due to a reduction of the amortizable basis of technology obtained in the rapidstream acquisition and expenses associated with amortization of technology obtained in the qiave acquisition 
impairment of other intangible assets acquired during the third quarter of  it was determined that an impairment existed for the intangible asset associated with the rapidstream secured by check point product brand based on the technology obtained in the acquisition of rapidstream 
our increased focus on the sme market  resulting in a significant reduction in our sales  marketing and development efforts in support of this brand  together with its historically poor performance  led management to reduce the future sales projections for the brand 
the revised undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from the reduced sales projections were determined to be insufficient to recover the carrying value of the related capitalized technology 
we therefore recorded an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of based on the revised estimate of the asset s fair value using a discounted cash flow approach 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit the market segment served by this product  we therefore recorded an additional impairment charge of  for the remaining book value of this intangible asset 
restructuring charges restructuring charges of million in and  in were associated with our restructuring plans initiated in and in the second quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan designed to streamline operations and reduce operating costs  which included a reduction in workforce and a consolidation of excess facilities  in addition to other cost saving strategies 
in the second quarter of  we implemented a second restructuring plan primarily designed to eliminate redundancies and excess headcount resulting from the acquisition of rapidstream  which included a reduction in workforce  consolidation of excess facilities and elimination of technology related contracts that were no longer required or part of our strategy 
costs incurred in and relate to the revision of our estimates for future costs associated with the sublease of excess facilities in our corporate headquarters in seattle  washington 
as the real estate market in downtown seattle remained depressed  we revised down our earlier estimates of possible sublease rental income for our space that remains vacant 
interest income  net interest income  net  is primarily comprised of interest income generated from our short term investments 
interest income was million for both and income tax provision benefit income tax expense of  in and income tax benefit of  in primarily relates to our provision for foreign income taxes associated with our international operations 
a benefit of  was 
table of contents recorded during the fourth quarter of due to the reversal of previously accrued foreign tax reserves determined to be no longer necessary 
we have experienced losses since inception  resulting in a net operating loss carryforward position for federal income tax purposes of approximately million as of december  these carryforwards  if not utilized  will begin to expire after the tax year  and may be subject to limitations under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in addition  approximately million of the net operating losses generated for federal income tax purposes are not available to reduce income tax expense for financial reporting purposes because the effects of tax deductions for employee stock options in excess of the related financial reporting compensation expense are recognized as a component of stockholders equity 
a valuation allowance has been established to reflect the uncertainty of generating future taxable income necessary to utilize available tax loss carryforwards

revenue information for customers representing more than of total revenues  in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  was as follows year ended december  percent increase revenues in thousands tech data ingram micro revenues as of total revenues tech data ingram micro the dollar and percentage decrease in product revenues for  as compared to  was primarily due to decreased revenues from sales of our firebox iii product line 
firebox iii revenues decreased despite an increase in unit shipments due to a reduction in average selling prices 
the unfavorable pricing changes are the result of sales promotions and extension of aggressive trade up and competitive trade in programs we introduced in response to competitive pricing pressure in the mid tier of our market  combined with the fact that the firebox iii product line was entering its third year on the market and a replacement product line was expected early in the decline in revenues is also partially attributable to a mix shift as we introduced a lower priced product model within the firebox iii line in the first quarter of we managed inventory levels of the firebox iii line in anticipation of the introduction of our firebox x product line in february  which replaced the firebox iii product line 
the decrease in product revenues is also partially attributable to the decline in sales of the rapidstream secured by checkpoint products  due to our increased focus on the sme market and diminished sales and marketing support for the rapidstream secured by checkpoint brand  which was targeted at the large enterprise market 
in the fourth quarter of  we made a decision to exit the market segment served by those products and terminated their manufacturing and promotion 
partially offsetting these declines were revenue increases from our soho and vclass product lines 
those increases are attributable to growth in unit shipments from new product introductions  including the firebox vclass introduced in the second quarter of  the firebox soho introduced in the third quarter of  further additions of new products to the firebox vclass line introduced in the first quarter of and firebox soho wireless products introduced in the second quarter of from a regional standpoint  we experienced a decrease in total revenues from our apac market  specifically in japan  while total revenues for the americas and emea increased 
in the beginning of and continuing throughout  we attempted to realign our apac business  focused on improving the performance of our sales channel  reevaluated our channel customer selection strategy and localized some of our products 

table of contents service revenues consist of revenues recognized from initial fees for our livesecurity service subscriptions bundled with a hardware product sale  and revenues recognized for subscription renewals sold to the existing customer base 
the increase in service revenues in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues for  as compared to  was primarily due to the increase in revenues generated on subscription renewals  as our installed customer base grew 
this increase in revenues from subscription renewals was partially offset by several factors as follows changes in terms of our initial livesecurity service subscriptions  bundled with a product sale  due to our including a shorter initial subscription period for certain products beginning in mid  a reduction of livesecurity service subscription prices corresponding to lower prices on related hardware products in response to a competitive environment  and a shift in product mix toward lower priced models of the firebox iii product line  resulting in the corresponding shift in mix in livesecurity service subscription revenues 
the increase in service revenues for  as compared to  was also partially attributable to service revenue of  in generated from livesecurity services that were provided through certain managed security customers to their end users in prior periods  but were identified by watchguard through a license compliance initiative as being previously unreported to watchguard by those customers 
the provision for sales returns  price protection rights and promotional rebates was million  or of total revenues before these returns and allowances  in and million  or of total revenues before returns and allowances  in the higher provision in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for  as compared to  corresponds to increased unit shipments  as well as an increase in promotional offerings in we expect to introduce new products and promotional programs each year  which may affect our reserve for sales returns and allowances

table of contents cost of product revenues includes the cost of manufacturing our security appliances  distribution operations  product packaging  third party product licensing fees and provisions for inventory reserves and warranty 
the dollar increase in cost of product revenues for  as compared to  was primarily due to the increase in unit volume and in the provision for inventory reserves 
the provision for inventory reserves increased from million in to million in quantities of shipments of our products and related consumption of component inventory were below our expectations 
our sales projections for future quarters and product life cycle considerations related to our plan to introduce new products in the latter part of resulted in our recording an additional provision for inventory reserves for certain of our products and related components 
the provision also includes the write down of our rapidstream secured by check point brand products  as we discontinued further development and marketing of this brand 
this brand is a subset of the products and technology obtained as a result of our april acquisition of rapidstream 
the decline in product margins as a percentage of product revenues was negatively affected by an increase in inventory reserves  by continued competitive pricing in the marketplace for our products  which included aggressive trade up and competitive trade in programs relating to the firebox iii line  by the introduction of new lower margin product models within the firebox iii and firebox vclass product lines in the beginning of  and by the relatively fixed nature of distribution and manufacturing support costs on lower revenues 
if the provision for inventory reserves were excluded from the calculation of product margin  the product margin as a percentage of product revenues would have been approximately for and for cost of service revenues includes the costs of our technical support organization and costs associated with our livesecurity service 
cost of service revenues increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percentage of related revenues for  as compared to the dollar increase in cost of services is primarily due to the increase of internal information technology costs associated with the livesecurity service and customer support 
in  we made significant investments in information technology that consolidated our customer facing applications and databases and migrated them onto more scalable and extensible application platforms 
this cost increase was partially offset by cost savings achieved after transitioning to a new provider of the first level of customer support 
service margins increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of service revenues due to operational and cost efficiencies we have realized from our expanded customer base  resulting in lower incremental costs incurred to add each additional subscription customer 
operating expenses sales and marketing year ended december  percent decrease sales and marketing expenses in thousands sales and marketing expenses as of total revenues sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and employee related expenses and certain variable marketing expenses  including distributor promotional costs  public relations costs  marketing collateral  trade show and advertising expenses 
the dollar decrease in sales and marketing expenses for  as compared to  was primarily due to the decline in variable marketing expenditures  especially due to a reduction of distributor promotional programs 
distributor promotional programs were reduced from million in to million in those costs declined as we attempted to balance those activities with the increases in direct sales discounts available to our channel customers 

table of contents costs of other marketing programs  such as advertising  marketing collateral and promotions  trade shows  public relations  market research  direct marketing and other programs declined from million in to million in the reduction in those marketing programs resulted from our enhanced expenditures in related to the international rollout of the new firebox vclass product line 
those decreases in distributor promotional costs and marketing programs were partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits 
research and development year ended december  percent decrease research and development expenses in thousands research and development expenses as of total revenues research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products  product integration efforts and quality assurance activities 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  costs of noncapitalized equipment  software tools  our security appliance prototypes and certification procedures  payments to designers and contractors and depreciation of capital equipment and software 
research and development expenses decreased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for  as compared to this decline was primarily due to the decline in salaries and benefits associated with elimination in personnel redundancies caused by our rapidstream acquisition in headcount related compensation costs and other research and development costs increased substantially in the second quarter of as a result of the rapidstream acquisition and due to product integration efforts we implemented to accelerate the rollout of new vclass products based on the rapidstream technology 
headcount was gradually brought down to pre acquisition levels by the end of the second quarter of as redundant functions were eliminated 
also  lower than expected serverlock revenue in resulted in reductions of related research and development costs for this product line 
these cost savings were partially offset by the increase in outsourced expenses  primarily due to the additional cost of undergoing the evaluation for common criteria evaluation assurance level and federal processing standards certification for the firebox vclass product line in general and administrative year ended december  percent increase general and administrative expenses in thousands general and administrative expenses as of total revenues general and administrative expenses include costs of executive  human resource  finance and administrative support functions  provisions for uncollectible accounts  costs of legal and accounting professional services  and director and officer insurance 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars and declined slightly as a percentage of revenues for  as compared to the dollar increase in general and administrative expenses for  as compared to  reflects increases in severance costs  as well as an increase in legal and accounting fees as a result of enhanced corporate governance requirements 
those increases were partially offset by a reduction in travel costs

table of contents stock based compensation stock based compensation expenses allocated by functional operating expense category were as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  percent decrease sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation stock based compensation expenses arise primarily from amortization of previously deferred stock based compensation over the vesting periods of common stock subject to repurchase and to stock options 
deferred stock based compensation is initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity in the amount of the excess of the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant over the exercise price of options and also in the amount of the fair value of our common stock that we issued in connection with our october acquisition of qiave and our april acquisition of rapidstream that is subject to repurchase 
in addition  deferred stock based compensation is recorded for the fair value of stock options granted to consultants 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized into expense over the relevant vesting periods using the accelerated method 
amortization of other intangible assets acquired amortization of other intangible assets acquired consists of amortization of capitalized technology and other definite lived intangibles related to our acquisitions of qiave in and rapidstream in we are amortizing the intangible assets on a straight line basis over useful lives ranging from three to five years 
amortization of other intangible assets acquired was million for and million for the decrease in amortization of other intangible assets acquired for  as compared to  resulted primarily from the reduction in the amortizable basis of other intangible assets 
this reduction  in turn  was caused by the impairment of the technology we obtained in the acquisition of qiave in october  as discussed below 
the amortization related to this technology decreased by approximately million in  as compared to this intangible asset was fully amortized by the end of this reduction in amortization was partially offset by the  increase in amortization of technology obtained in the acquisition of rapidstream in april this increase is primarily caused by the fact that in this technology was amortized for a full year  as opposed to  when it was amortized over only a partial year from the time of acquisition 
impairment of other intangible assets acquired in addition to the amortization expense  a partial impairment of the intangible assets related to our acquisition of qiave in was recorded in the fourth quarter of and a partial impairment of the intangible assets related to our acquisition of rapidstream in was recorded in the third and fourth quarters of in accordance with sfas  the carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external  that may suggest impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  we developed a business plan that  because of limited resources  constrained further development and integration of the technology we obtained in connection with our acquisition of qiave in october separately  we continued to realize lower than expected revenue from products based on the qiave technology 
as a result  the expected future cash flows were determined to be 
table of contents insufficient to support the carrying value of the qiave capitalized technology 
we therefore recorded an impairment charge of million in the last quarter of of capitalized technology related to the acquisition of qiave 
during the third quarter of  it was determined that an impairment existed for the intangible asset associated with the rapidstream secured by check point product brand based on the technology obtained in the acquisition of rapidstream 
our increased focus on the sme market  resulting in a significant reduction in our sales  marketing and development efforts in support of this brand  together with the historically poor performance of this brand  led management to reduce the future sales projections for the brand 
the revised undiscounted expected future cash flows resulting from the reduced sales projections were determined to be insufficient to recover the carrying value of the related capitalized technology 
we therefore recorded an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of based on the revised estimate of the asset s fair value using a discounted cash flow approach 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit the market segment served by this product  we therefore recorded an additional impairment charge of  for the remaining book value of this intangible asset 
acquired in process technology acquired in process technology expenses of million in consists of in process research and development expense related to our acquisition of rapidstream 
restructuring charges the restructuring charges in are associated with the restructuring plans initiated in and in the second quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan designed to streamline operations and reduce operating costs  which included a reduction in workforce and a consolidation of excess facilities  in addition to other cost saving strategies 
as part of the restructuring plan  we exited the consumer security market and terminated various original equipment manufacturer agreements to develop products and services for that market  and streamlined operations in support of new products and services aimed at business customers 
in  we recorded additional restructuring charges of million relating to revised estimates of the costs associated with the consolidation and sublease of excess facilities 
in the second quarter of  we implemented a second restructuring plan primarily designed to eliminate redundancies and excess headcount resulting from the acquisition of rapidstream  which included a reduction in workforce  consolidation of excess facilities and elimination of technology related contracts that are no longer required or part of our strategy 
as a result of this restructuring  we recorded a million restructuring charge in relating to severance and termination benefits  costs of consolidation and sublease of excess facilities and cost of technology related contracts cancellation 
the restructuring charges of million in are associated with the restructuring plans initiated in and  discussed above 
the additional charges in relate to the revision of our estimates for future costs associated with the sublease of excess facilities in our corporate headquarters in seattle  washington 
as the real estate market in downtown seattle remained depressed  we revised down our earlier estimates of possible sublease rental income for our space that remains vacant 
interest income  net interest income  net  is primarily comprised of interest income generated from our investment of proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering in and our follow on public offering in february interest income decreased from million in to million in the decrease was caused by both a decrease in the average balance invested and a decline in the average rates of return 

table of contents income tax provision income tax expense of  in and  in primarily relates to our provision for foreign income taxes associated with our international operations 
we have experienced losses since inception  resulting in a net operating loss carryforward position for federal income tax purposes of approximately million as of december  these carryforwards  if not utilized  will begin to expire after the tax year  and may be subject to limitations under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in addition  approximately million of the net operating losses generated for federal income tax purposes are not available to reduce income tax expense for financial reporting purposes because the effects of tax deductions for employee stock options in excess of the related financial reporting compensation expense are recognized through equity 
a valuation allowance has been established to reflect the uncertainty of generating future taxable income necessary to utilize available tax loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term and available for sale investments  which were invested primarily in high quality money market accounts and marketable securities 
our working capital as of december  was million 
operating activities our operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of million in and million in the operating cash outflows during these periods resulted primarily from net losses 
operating cash outflows for also reflect increases in net working capital  apart from cash and investments 
the difference between our net loss and our operating cash outflow is attributable to noncash expenses included in net loss  and changes in the operating assets and liabilities  as presented below in thousands year ended december  net loss add noncash expenses add changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities noncash expenses are associated with the amortization and impairment of other intangible assets acquired  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  and compensation charges resulting from the issuance of stock options and common stock subject to repurchase by us 
changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect primarily changes in working capital components of the balance sheet apart from cash and short term investments  and also changes in long term deferred revenues and long term restructuring liabilities with larger fluctuations within some of them  as described below 
trade accounts receivable  net increased from million at december  to million at december   reflecting higher total revenues in  as compared to  and revenues weighted more heavily toward the end of the fourth quarter in compared to days sales outstanding  or dsos  calculated on a quarterly basis  increased from days at december  to days at december  dsos are affected by the payment terms contained in our customer contracts which may vary geographically  term discounts taken by our customers  revenues on product sales for some of our major distributors that are recorded when these distributors have sold the product to their customers

based on our current sales mix  the linearity of revenues in past and future quarters and timing differences arising from the varying payment terms in our customer agreements  we expect our dsos to generally range from to days in the future 
any change in these factors  however  could negatively affect expected dso results 
prepaid expenses and other decreased from million at december  to million at december   primarily reflecting prepayments in  in the form of vendor advances  which were expensed in total accrued restructuring and acquisition costs decreased from million at december  to million at december   reflecting a restructuring charge of  in less the ongoing payment of rents on abandoned facilities 
total deferred revenues increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in deferred revenues is primarily due to an increase in livesecurity service subscription renewals on a growing installed customer base as well as introduction of several new service offerings in investing activities cash provided by investing activities was  in and  in for both periods  net cash flows provided by investing activities primarily reflect changes in our short term investment portfolio  offset by capital expenditures for property and equipment 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in both periods reflects the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe that our existing available cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we may seek additional funding before that time through public or private financings or other arrangements  however  if the underlying assumed levels of spending prove to be inaccurate  or if we choose to pursue acquisitions or investments in complementary business technology 
contractual obligations and contingencies we lease office space and some computer equipment under operating leases that are noncancelable 
our facilities commitments include a lease for our corporate headquarters in seattle  washington  which expires in september  with an option to extend this lease for an additional five year term 
we lease a product fulfillment and distribution warehouse in seattle with a lease term through april we also lease facilities in aliso viejo  san jose and tustin  california and waltham  massachusetts under operating leases that expire between and  in addition to leases for other sales offices under operating leases or other lease obligations that expire over various terms

at december   the total amount of those agreements was  off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that contingently require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims 
these may include agreements with vendors and suppliers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services  agreements with customers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use of our products or services  real estate and equipment leases  under which we may indemnify lessors against third party claims relating to use of their property  agreements with licensees or licensors  under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property  and agreements with initial purchasers and underwriters of our securities  under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions 
in addition  as permitted or required under delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under delaware law  we have certain obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
these indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation  and  with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful 
the nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract  and generally a maximum obligation is not stated 
because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation  and because management does not expect these indemnifications to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows  no related liabilities are recorded at december  we hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain indemnifications and  historically  we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these obligations
