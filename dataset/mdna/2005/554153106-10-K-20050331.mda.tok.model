laundry equipment sales and services increased  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to a slight increase in the number of units sold and a favorable impact on revenue caused by the product mix sold 
copico revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in equipment use in libraries and similar facilities  as compared to  and a reduction in the number of locations operated by the company 
the company is forecasting decreases in copico revenue to continue as the usage of vended reprographics equipment declines and the company continues its strategy of not renewing contracts which it does not predict will have a positive impact on income 
microfridge total annual equipment sales increased  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the largest contributor to this increase in sales was the segment s academic business  which experienced revenue growth of  or in as compared to sales to hotel and assisted living customers increased  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in offsetting these increases was a decrease in sales to government customers of  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increases in sales to the academic and hotel and assisted living customers are primarily attributable to the improved economic conditions  the company s ability to attract new customers and the introduction of new appliance products 
the decrease in the government sales business is primarily attributable to overall spending by the government being directed away from military housing improvements and toward the current military efforts in the middle east 
cost of revenue facilities management rent 
facilities management rent includes the amount of rent paid to laundry facilities management and copico customers 
facilities management rent increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the additional contracts added to the laundry facilities management business as a result of the january acquisition 
as a percentage of laundry facilities management revenue  laundry facilities management rent has increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this increase is the result of the contractual laundry facilities management rent rate for the portfolio of contracts acquired in january being slightly higher than the company s existing contracts 
laundry facilities management rent can be affected by new and renegotiated contracts and by other factors such as the amount of prepaid rent payments and laundry room betterments invested in new or renegotiated contracts 
as the company varies the amount invested in a property  the facilities management rent as a derivative of facilities management revenue can vary 
prepaid rent payments and betterments are amortized over the life of the contract 
the percentage of facilities management rent to facilities management revenue is also impacted by the facilities management rent rate structure in the copico business 
because this business has a much lower facilities management rent rate structure than the laundry facilities management business  any decrease in revenue will result in an increase in the overall facilities management rent percentage of revenue 
facilities management expenditures and other direct costs 
facilities management expenditures and other direct costs include costs associated with installing and servicing laundry facilities management equipment  as well as the costs of collecting  counting and depositing the revenue 
facilities management expenditures and other direct costs also include the costs of delivering and servicing rented laundry facilities management equipment and microfridge equipment

in  laundry and microfridge equipment sales decreased as a percentage of total revenue 
these sales typically create higher operating costs due to delivery and installation generally being more costly in the sales business than in the facilities management business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization include amounts included as a component of cost of revenue  which are primarily related to laundry facilities management equipment in the field  and amounts included as an operating expense  which are primarily non revenue generating corporate assets 
aggregate depreciation and amortization increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the depreciation and amortization of assets and contracts comprising the laundry facilities management assets purchased in january the laundry facilities management field equipment acquired had an appraised value of  as of the acquisition date 
the company is depreciating this equipment over five years 
the contract rights acquired had an appraised value of  as of the acquisition date and are being amortized over twenty years 
also contributing to the increased depreciation expense over was more new equipment placed in service at new locations and more replacement of equipment as contracts were renegotiated

cost of product sales increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  gross margins on product sales were for both of the years ended december  and the gross margin on product sales includes laundry and microfridge equipment sales 
the gross margin in the laundry equipment sales business decreased slightly in as compared to due to competitive pressure and a cost increase to the company which was not entirely passed on to its customers

management believes presentation of this measure is appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our historical financial performance and future prospects

excluding the loss on early extinguishment of debt and the gain on sale of assets to web  income from operations would have been  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  or a increase 
these increases were due primarily to the reasons discussed above 
a reconciliation of income from operations  as reported  to income from operations  as adjusted  is provided below for the years ended december  income from operations  as reported   loss on early extinguishment of debt gain on sale of fixed assets to web  income from operations  as adjusted   income from operations  as adjusted  is provided because the company believes that certain investors may find it to be a useful tool towards understanding of the company s overall historical financial performance 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the increased borrowings in january to finance the approximately million acquisition of web s eastern region laundry facilities management assets 
non cash interest expense associated with the accounting treatment of the company s interest rate swap agreements resulted in interest expense of  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gain on sale of lease receivables 
during  the company sold certain lease receivables associated with the microfridge segment 
the gain associated with this sale is primarily attributable to the interest income that would have been recognized throughout the life of the lease had it not been sold 
provision for income tax 
the provision for income taxes increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to the changes in taxable income 
the effective tax rate has remained relatively constant at and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  total revenue decreased by  or less than  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was related to decreases in microfridge sales and rental revenue and reprographics facilities management revenue  offset by increases in laundry facilities management revenue  and laundry equipment sales 
the decrease in microfridge revenue  as compared to  is attributable primarily to a decrease of in the academic sales and rental business 
the microfridge academic market decreases were offset  in part  by an increase in revenue of in the microfridge government and military sales business 
revenues for the microfridge hotel and assisted living business was essentially the same in as in the decrease in the academic business  as compared to  was caused primarily by fewer sales of microfridge units to colleges and universities  and less rental business on campuses  both rented to colleges and directly to students 
we believe these lower numbers were due to colleges and universities shifting the cost of purchasing certain amenities to the students as well as the increased availability of similar products at retail stores 
the increased availability of similar appliances at retail stores and our avoidance of low margin rental contracts are the primary reasons for microfridge rental income decreasing in as compared to although it is the company s strategy to convert school rental customers to a purchase program  the company has not been successful in converting sufficient programs to offset losses resulting from this ongoing decline in microfridge rental revenue and does not believe it will be able to achieve this objective in the future 
the increase in microfridge government and military sales is due primarily to the increased government spending on military base housing  and the company s increased sales and marketing efforts toward this business segment 
in general  hotels and assisted living facilities have not increased spending on amenities such as microfridge products as compared to  which were down significantly from prior levels due to the general us economic slowdown 
the company has succeeded at maintaining its market share in this business by increasing its market penetration and promotional spending 
total laundry facilities management revenue increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of pieces of equipment in service  increases in vend rates  and continued conversion from coin operated equipment to higher revenue generating card operated equipment  partially offset by a decrease in revenue caused by an increase in apartment vacancy rates in several of the company s laundry facilities management markets 
the apartment vacancy rates have increased for the second consecutive year  particularly in florida  georgia  and north carolina  where the company generates approximately of its laundry facilities management revenue 
vacancy rates also continue to increase in the northern markets where the company also conducts a significant portion of its business  though not to the extent of the increases in the southern markets 
fourth quarter industry indicators show that growth in the apartment vacancy rate is slowing in nearly all of the company s markets 
the increase in the number of pieces of equipment placed in service was achieved through increases in all of the company s laundry facilities management markets  particularly the northeast  where targeted marketing campaigns  and experienced sales personnel were added 
increases in equipment vend rates are typically made at locations which have not had an increase in vend price for over a year 
an increase in vend price at a coin operated location will typically be in increments of per use  whereas at a card operated location the increase may vary due to technology allowing for increases in more flexible increments 
copico revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to the decrease in equipment use in libraries and similar facilities  as compared to  and a reduction in the number of locations operated by the company 
in  the company continued its strategy  begun in the second half of  of not renewing contracts when it could not negotiate acceptable pricing terms 
this resulted in the elimination of approximately accounts in  representing approximately of its revenue 
also affecting the revenue decline in as compared to were accounts not yet renegotiated or eliminated which had decreased usage as compared to laundry equipment sales increased by  or to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this slight increase is primarily attributable to a slight increase in the number of units sold and a favorable impact on revenue caused by the product mix sold 
cost of revenue facilities management rent 
facilities management rent includes the amount of rent paid to laundry facilities management and copico customers 
facilities management rent increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in laundry facilities management revenue of  partially offset by a decrease in copico revenue of the ratio of laundry facilities management rent to laundry facilities management revenue did not change for the year ended december  as compared to laundry facilities management rent can be affected by new and renegotiated contracts and by other factors such as the amount of prepaid rent payments and laundry room betterments invested in new or renegotiated contracts 
as the company varies the amount invested in a property  the facilities management rent as a derivative of facilities management revenue can vary 
prepaid rent payments and betterments are amortized over the life of the contract

in  laundry and microfridge equipment sales decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue

general  administration  sales and marketing expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  general  administration  sales and marketing expenses were of revenue for the years ended december  and this increase in spending was primarily attributable to increases in advertising  promotional spending and professional fees

as a result of an evaluation conducted by an independent third party valuation firm  it was determined that the fair value of the laundry and microfridge business units exceeded their book value  therefore no impairment of goodwill occurred in these business units 
however  due to the continued decline in the services of the reprographics business unit as a result of expanding use of the internet and access to free laser printers in college and public libraries  the book value of the reprographics business unit exceeded the fair value  resulting in a non cash write off of the remaining book value of the business unit s goodwill in the period ended march   of  or per share

outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest  at the company s option  at a rate equal to the prime rate plus  or libor plus 
the applicable prime rate and libor margin may be adjusted quarterly based on certain financial ratios 
the credit facility contains a commitment fee which is calculated as a percentage of the average daily unused portion of the credit facility 
this percentage  currently  may be adjusted quarterly based on the funded debt ratio 
the credit facility includes certain financial and operational covenants  including restrictions on paying dividends and other distributions  making certain acquisitions and incurring indebtedness  and requires that the company maintain certain financial ratios 
the most important of these financial ratios are for the company to maintain a leverage ratio of less than or equal to  reducing quarterly to from and after december   and a coverage ratio of greater than or equal to

if interest expense as calculated is greater based on the day libor  the financial institution pays the difference to the company  if interest expense as calculated is greater based on the fixed rate  the company pays the difference to the financial institution 
depending on fluctuations in the libor  the company s interest rate exposure and its related impact on interest expense and net cash flow may increase or decrease 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counter party to the swap agreement  however  nonperformance is not anticipated 
the fair value of the swap agreements is the estimated amount that the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the counter party 
at december   the fair value of the swap agreements  net of related taxes  was an unrealized gain of this amount has been included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
on june   the company terminated its two  interest rate swap agreements  which had been in effect since february and january  respectively 
the january interest rate swap agreement was due to expire in february while the february interest rate swap agreement was due to expire in february the company paid  to terminate both the february and january swap agreements 
as the timing of the forecasted future interest payments did not significantly change as a result of the new credit facility  the accumulated other comprehensive losses related to the terminated interest rate swap agreements are reclassified against current period earnings in the same period the forecasted interest payments occur 
upon termination  there was  net of taxes of  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the associated with the january interest rate swap agreement was reclassified as an earnings charge through february and the  associated with the february interest rate swap agreement is being reclassified as an earnings charge through february contractual obligations a summary of the company s contractual obligations and commitments related to its outstanding long term debt and future minimum lease payments related to the company s vehicle fleet  warehouse rent and facilities management rent as of december  is as follows fiscal year long term debt facilities rent commitments capital lease commitments operating lease commitments total thereafter   total      we anticipate that available funds from current operations  existing cash and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet current operating requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  we may require external sources of financing for any significant future acquisitions 
further  the credit facility matures in january we expect the repayment of this facility will require external financing 
off balance sheet arrangements at the year ended december   and  the company had no relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements  or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
the company is  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships 
seasonality the company experiences moderate seasonality as a result of its operations in the college and university market 
revenues derived from the college and university market represent approximately of the company s total annual revenue 
academic facilities management and rental revenues are derived substantially during the school year in the first  second and fourth calendar quarters 
conversely  the company s operating and capital expenditures have historically been higher during the third calendar quarter  when the company installs a large amount of equipment while colleges and universities are generally on summer break 
product sales  principally of microfridge products  to this market are typically higher during the third calendar quarter as compared to the rest of the calendar year  somewhat offsetting the seasonality effect of the laundry facilities management business unit 
the laundry facilities management assets acquired in january are not expected to affect the degree of seasonality experienced by the company 
inflation the company does not believe that its financial performance has been materially affected by inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that effect the amounts reported 
a critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another  also reasonable  amount were used  or  a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period 
we base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  significant accounting policies  state the company s policies as they relate to significant matters cash and cash equivalents  revenue recognition  provision for doubtful accounts  inventories  provision for inventory reserves  intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents 
the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
on occasion the company has excess cash available for a short period of time  when this occurs  the company invests such excess cash in repurchase agreements and other highly liquid short term investments 
accordingly  the investments are subject to minimal credit and market risk 
included in cash and cash equivalents is an estimate of cash not yet collected at period end  which remains at laundry facilities management and copico customer locations 
at december  and  this totaled  and  respectively 
the company records the estimated cash not yet collected as cash and cash equivalents and facilities management revenue 
the company also records the estimated related facilities management rent expense 
these estimates are based upon historical collection trends  so that total cash at the end of each period will be reasonably stated 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes laundry facilities management and copico revenue on the accrual basis 
microfridge rental revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual period  which is generally less than one year 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment of the products  unless otherwise specified 
the company offers limited duration warranties on microfridge products and  at the time of sale  provides reserves for all estimated warranty costs based upon historical warranty costs 
actual costs have not exceeded the company s estimates 
shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized upon shipment of the products and are included in revenue with related cost included in cost of sales 
the company has entered into long term lease transactions that meet the qualifications of a sales type lease for certain equipment 
for these transactions  the amount of revenue recognized upon product shipment is the present value of the minimum lease payments  excluding executory costs and excluding profits on executory costs  discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease 
interest revenue is recognized over the life of the rental agreement 
at december  and the company had  and  respectively  in receivables related to sales type leases 
these receivables have been recorded net of unearned interest income of and at december  and these receivables are primarily due ratably over the next seven years and have been classified as other current assets and other long term assets  as appropriate  on the balance sheet 
the related reserve for uncollectible lease receivables at december  and was and  respectively 
the company has not entered into significant sales type leases since all installation and repair services are provided on an occurrence basis  not on a contractual basis 
related revenue is recognized at the time the installation service  or other service  is provided to the customer 
the company believes it s accounting for facilities management revenue  rental revenue  service fees and long term lease transactions are appropriate for the company  properly matching the earnings process with the proper reporting period 
provision for doubtful accounts 
on a regular basis  the company reviews the adequacy of its provision for doubtful accounts for trade accounts receivable and lease receivables based on historical collection results and current economic conditions using factors based on the aging of its trade accounts and lease receivable 
in addition  the company estimates specific additional allowances based on indications that a specific customer may be experiencing financial difficulties 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost as determined using the first in  first out method or market and primarily consist of finished goods 
based on the nature of the company s inventory  being laundry and microfridge equipment  and the inventory handling practices of the company  the company believes the lower of cost or market is the most appropriate valuation method for the company 
provision for inventory reserves 
on a regular basis  the company reviews the adequacy of its reserve for inventory obsolescence based on historical experience  product knowledge and frequency of shipments 
goodwill and intangible assets 
intangible assets primarily consist of various non compete agreements  customer lists  goodwill and contract rights recorded in connection with acquisitions 
the non compete agreements are amortized using the straight line method over the life of the agreements  which range from five to fifteen years 
customer lists are amortized using the straight line method over fifteen years 
contract rights are amortized using the straight line method over fifteen or twenty years 
the life assigned to acquired contracts is based on several factors  including the seller s renewal rate of the contract portfolio for the most recent years prior to the acquisition  the number of years the average contract has been in the seller s contract portfolio  the overall level of customer satisfaction within the contract portfolio and the ability of the company to maintain or exceed the level of customer satisfaction maintained by the seller prior to the acquisition by the company 
the company is accounting for acquired contract rights on a pool basis based on the fact that  in general  no single contract accounts for more than of the revenue of any acquired portfolio and the fact that few of the contracts are predicted to be terminated  either prior to or at the end of the contract term 
based on its experience  the company believes that these costs associated with various acquisitions are properly recognized and amortized over a reasonable length of time 
in accordance with fas  the company stopped amortizing goodwill on january  impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets  including fixed assets  acquired contract rights and intangible assets with definitive lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
the company s annual impairment test for contract rights assigned a year amortization period consists of comparing the current number of machines under contract and the current cash flow of all the company s contracts in the market where the portfolios were acquired to the original number of machines acquired and the cash flow as predicted by the company at the time of the acquisition 
for those contract rights assigned a year amortization period  the company s annual impairment test consists primarily of identifying the accumulated retention rate of the specific contract portfolio in order to assess the appropriateness of the net book value of the related contract rights 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
in accordance with fas  the company tests its goodwill annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
the goodwill impairment review consists of a two step process of first determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit 
fair values of the reporting units were determined based on estimates of comparable market price or discounted future cash flows 
if this fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further analysis or goodwill impairment charge is required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the underlying assets and liabilities  including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets  based on their fair value 
if necessary  goodwill is then written down to its fair value 
on january   in connection with the initial application of fas  the company recognized an impairment charge of financial instruments 
the company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb no 
fas 
these statements require the company to recognize derivatives on its balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if the derivative is a hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings  depending on the intended use of the derivative 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the change in fair value of the agreements is recognized in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the change is recognized in earnings immediately 
fair value of financial instruments 
for purposes of financial reporting  the company has determined that the fair value of financial instruments approximates book value at december  and  based upon terms currently available to the company in financial markets 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the counter party 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
fin requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
fin  as revised in december  must be applied at the end of periods ending after march   and is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  the adoption of the revised fin by the company did not have any impact on its results of operations or financial position  as at this time the company does not have a controlling interest in any variable interest entities 
the company will apply the consolidation requirement of fin in future periods if it should own any interest in any variable interest entity 
in november  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no

risk factors this annual report on form k contains statements which are not historical facts and are considered forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements contain projections of the company s future results of operations or financial position or state other forward looking information 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will and would or similar words 
you should not rely on forward looking statements  because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors may cause the company s actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that might cause these differences are as follows the company s cash flows may not be sufficient to finance the significant capital expenditures required to replace equipment and implement new technology 
the company must continue to make capital expenditures in order to maintain and replace existing equipment 
while it is anticipated that existing capital resources  as well as cash from operations  will be adequate to finance anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next year  the company cannot guarantee investors that the company s resources or cash flows will be sufficient 
to the extent that available resources are insufficient to fund capital requirements  the company may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or curtail certain capital expenditures 
such financings may not be available or available only on less favorable terms and  in the case of equity financings  could result in dilution to its stockholders 
indebtedness may limit the company s use of cash flow and restrict its flexibility 
in the event the company is unable to decrease the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility  the increased indebtedness could require use of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to make payments on indebtedness  leaving less cash flow available for other purposes  materially limit or impair the company s ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  general corporate or other purposes  and reduce flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 
failure to comply with the credit facility covenants may result in an acceleration of substantial indebtedness the credit facility requires the company to comply with various financial and other operating covenants on a quarterly basis 
failure to comply with any of these covenants  without obtaining a waiver from the lender  would permit the lender to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
an acceleration of the credit facility would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
these financial covenants consist of various leverage ratios and other targets  including maximum total leverage  maximum capital expenditures and restricted payments 
if the company were unable to renew its laundry leases the company s results of operations and business could be adversely affected 
the laundry facilities management business is highly dependent upon the renewal of leases with property owners  colleges and universities and public housing authorities 
these leases have an average length of seven to ten years with approximately to due for renewal each year 
mac gray has traditionally relied upon exclusive  long term leases with its customers  as well as frequent customer interaction and a historical emphasis on customer service  to assure continuity of financial and operating results 
the company cannot guarantee investors that it will be able to continue to secure long term exclusive leases with customers on favorable terms  it will be able to successfully renew existing leases as they expire  or it will not experience a loss of business if apartment vacancy rates increase or if property owners or management companies choose to vacate properties as a result of economic downturns that affect occupancy levels 
failure by the company to continue to obtain long term exclusive leases with a substantial number of its customers  or to successfully renew existing leases as they expire  could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and business 
competition on local and national levels may hinder the company s ability to expand 
the vended card or coin operated outsourced laundry facilities management industry is highly competitive  with local  regional and national competitors 
on the local and regional levels  private businesses tend to have long standing relationships with property owners and managers in their specific geographic market 
on the national level  there is one competitor with a larger installed equipment base than mac gray  which we compete with in several markets 
these competitive forces may increase purchase prices for future acquisitions to levels that make the acquisitions less attractive or uneconomical 
additionally  our competitors may make acquisitions or may establish agreements among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to compete within the industry 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
therefore  the company cannot assure investors that it will be able to compete effectively in any specific geographic location in the business of supplying laundry facilities management services to property owners and managers or in the acquisition of other businesses 
if the company is unable to continue its relationships with maytag and other suppliers  the company s profit margins could be reduced and its ability to meet customer requirements could be adversely impacted 
currently the company purchases a majority of the equipment that it uses in its laundry facilities management business from maytag 
in addition  the company derives a significant amount of its non laundry facilities management revenue  as well as competitive advantages  from its position as a distributor of maytag commercial laundry products 
although either party  upon written notice  may terminate the agreements between the company and maytag  maytag has never terminated any agreement with the company 
the company s relationship with maytag dates from in addition  the company currently procures the products used by the microfridge segment from a limited number of suppliers 
if these suppliers terminated or demanded a substantial revision of the contracts or business relationships currently in place  there may be a delay in finding a replacement  and an inability to find terms as favorable as the current terms  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations or its ability to meet customer demands 
the microfridge segment has a non competition agreement with sanyo whereby sanyo is precluded from entering the microfridge market  provided that certain minimum annual quantities of products are purchased from sanyo 
the company s ability to consummate acquisitions depends upon its ability to access capital on acceptable terms 
the success of the company s long term growth strategy is partially dependent upon its ability to identify  finance and consummate acquisitions on acceptable financial terms 
access to capital is subject to the following risks use of common stock as acquisition consideration may result in dilution to stockholders  if the common stock does not maintain a sufficient valuation or if potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept shares of the company s common stock  then the company will be required to use more cash resources or other consideration to make acquisitions  if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash for acquisitions from existing operations  its ability to consummate acquisitions would be adversely affected  unless it is able to obtain additional capital through external financings  however  the company cannot assure investors that it would be able to consummate external financings on commercially reasonable terms or at all  funding future acquisitions through debt financing would result in additional leverage  and the agreements governing the company s debt include significant limitations or restrictions on its ability to borrow money for acquisitions and other purposes and as a result  the company may not be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities 
if the company acquires any companies in the future  they could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt the company s business or have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has in the past  and may in the future  engage in acquisitions to continue expansion of its laundry facilities management business 
for example  in each of january and  the company completed acquisitions of certain laundry facilities management assets 
while the company generally believes that the management team and business structure currently in place enables it to operate a significantly larger and more diverse operation  it may be exposed to the following risks in connection with finding  completing  and successfully integrating acquisitions the inability to effectively and efficiently integrate the assets of the acquired business  potential disruption of the company s ongoing business and distraction of management  unanticipated expenses related to equipment  maintenance and technology integration  exposure to unknown liabilities  including litigation against acquired companies  additional costs due to entering new geographic locations  potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies  the inability to achieve anticipated synergies  increase the revenue and profit of the acquired business  and the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of money and time integrating acquired businesses  particularly operations located in new regions and operations involving new lines of business 
failure to successfully integrate the business acquired from web service company  inc would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations on january  the company acquired the southern and western laundry facilities management assets of web service company  inc the majority of these assets are outside the company s existing geographical markets 
there can be no guarantee that a successful integration of these assets will occur 
failure to successfully complete the integration could adversely affect the overall results and financial strength of the company 
multi unit housing vacancy rates could affect revenue from the operations of laundry facilities management contracts 
consistency of revenue from the operations of vended laundry equipment  particularly in the multi unit housing industry  depends partially upon the level of tenant occupancy 
the number of apartments occupied in an apartment building with a vended laundry room directly affects the company s revenue 
extended periods of reduced occupancy in our customers buildings can adversely affect our revenue 
the level of occupancy can be adversely affected by many market economic conditions  all of which are beyond the company s control  including local economic recessions  and increases in the unemployment rate  oversupply of apartments  and lower mortgage interest rates which encourage apartment dwellers to purchase homes 
the company may be susceptible to product liability claims for which insurance may not be adequate 
through the microfridge segment  the company markets and distributes combination refrigerator freezer microwave ovens  or units  under the brand name microfridge 
in addition  the company acts as a third party distributor of maytag s and other suppliers equipment 
the sale and distribution of microfridge units  as well as other products  entails a risk of product liability claims 
further  although microfridge units are manufactured by third parties under contract with the company  the company may be subject to risks of product liability claims related to this manufacture 
potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of the company s product liability insurance coverage or may be excluded from that coverage 
the company cannot assure investors that it will be able to renew its existing product liability insurance at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that currently in effect  if at all 
in the event that the company is held liable for a claim for which it is not indemnified or for damages exceeding the limits of its product liability insurance coverage  the claim could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
reliance upon common law and contractual intellectual property rights may be insufficient to protect the company from adverse claims 
the company relies upon certain trademark  service mark  copyright  patent and trade secret  confidentiality provisions  employee and third party non disclosure and non solicitation agreements and other methods to establish and protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights 
the company cannot be certain that steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate any of its intellectual property or proprietary rights 
while the company has periodically made filings with the us patent and trademark office  the company has traditionally relied upon the protections afforded by contract rights and through common law ownership rights  and the company cannot assure investors that these contract rights and legal claims to ownership will adequately protect its intellectual property or proprietary rights 
any infringement or misappropriation of the company s intellectual property or proprietary rights could damage their value and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may have to engage in litigation to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights  which could result in significant litigation costs and require a significant amount of management s time 
the company has significant intangible assets  the value of which might not be realized in the event of a sale or liquidation of the company s businesses 
as of december   approximately million  or  of the company s total assets were intangible assets  consisting primarily of contract rights and goodwill 
in the event of a sale or liquidation  there can be no assurance that the value of these intangible assets would be realized 
the company faces risks associated with environmental regulation 
the company s business and operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of  and establish standards for the handling  generation  emission  release  discharge  treatment  storage and disposal of  certain materials  substances and wastes 
to the best of the company s knowledge  there are no existing or potential environmental claims against it  nor has the company received any notification of responsibility for  or any inquiry or investigation regarding  any disposal  release or threatened release of any hazardous material  substance or waste generated by us that is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
however  the company cannot predict with any certainty that it will not in the future incur any liability under environmental laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition 
certain stockholders  directors and executive officers could exercise control and prevent a sale or merger 
as of march   mac gray s directors  executive officers  and certain of its stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
this percentage ownership does not include options to purchase  shares of the common stock held by some of these persons  all of which are currently exercisable 
if these affiliates exercised any of their options  then the ownership of common stock would be further concentrated 
as a result of this concentration in ownership  these stockholders  acting together  have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of the election of directors and all other matters requiring approval by a majority of stockholders 
matters requiring stockholder approval include significant corporate transactions  such as mergers and sales of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
the concentration of ownership in affiliates  together  in some cases  with specific provisions of the company s charter and bylaws  as described below  and applicable sections of the corporate law of delaware  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of mac gray 
provisions of the company s charter  bylaws  delaware law  and the shareholder rights agreement could have the effect of discouraging takeovers 
specific provisions of the company s charter and bylaws  as described below  sections of the corporate law of delaware  the shareholder rights agreement  and powers of the board of directors may discourage takeover attempts not first approved by the board of directors  including takeovers which some stockholders may deem to be in their best interests 
these provisions and powers of the board of directors could delay or prevent the removal of incumbent directors or the assumption of control by stockholders  even if the particular removal or assumption of control would be beneficial to stockholders 
these provisions and powers of the board of directors could also discourage or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  even if these events would be beneficial  in the short term  to the interests of stockholders 
the anti takeover provisions and powers of the board of directors include  among other things the ability of the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to establish the voting rights  preferences and other terms of such preferred stock  a classified board of directors serving staggered three year terms  the elimination of stockholder voting by written consent  the absence of cumulative voting for directors  the removal of directors only for cause  the vesting of exclusive authority in the board of directors to determine the size of the board of directors and  subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock  if issued  to fill vacancies thereon  the vesting of exclusive authority in the board of directors  except as otherwise required by law  to call special meetings of stockholders  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board of directors  ownership restrictions  under the corporate law of delaware  with limited exceptions  upon acquirers including their affiliates and associates of or more of its common stock  and the company s entry into a shareholder rights agreement providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or more of the common shares unless the rights are redeemed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates on its borrowings 
in the normal course of its business  the company manages its exposure to these risks as described below 
the company does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rates the table below provides information about the company s debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the fair market value of long term debt approximates book value at december  expected maturity date in thousands december  thereafter total long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate on june   the company terminated its two  interest rate swap agreements  which had been in effect since february and january  respectively 
the january interest rate swap agreement was due to expire in february while the february interest rate swap agreement was due to expire in february the company paid  to terminate both the february and january swap agreements 
as the timing of the forecasted future interest payments did not significantly change as a result of the new credit facility  the accumulated other comprehensive losses related to the terminated interest rate swap agreements are reclassified against current period earnings in the same period the forecasted interest payments occur 
upon termination  there was  net of taxes of  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the associated with the january interest rate swap agreement was reclassified as an earnings charge through february and the  associated with the february interest rate swap agreement will be reclassified as an earnings charge through february the company has entered into standard international swaps and derivatives association isda interest rate swap agreements the swap agreements to manage the interest rate risk associated with its and credit facility 
the company has also elected to enter into a swap agreement to coincide with the amortizing mortgage loan 
the company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges 
the table below outlines the details of each swap agreement date of origin original notional amount fixed amortizing notional amount december  expiration date fixed rate jun   fixed  jun  jun   amortizing  jun  feb   fixed  feb  mar   amortizing  dec  in accordance with the swap agreements and on a quarterly basis  interest expense is calculated based on the floating day libor and the fixed rate 
if interest expense as calculated is greater based on the day libor  the financial institution pays the difference to the company  if interest expense as calculated is greater based on the fixed rate  the company pays the difference to the financial institution 
depending on fluctuations in the libor  the company s interest rate exposure and its related impact on interest expense and net cash flow may increase or decrease 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the swap agreement  however  nonperformance is not anticipated 
the fair value of the swap agreements is the estimated amount that the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the counter party 
at december   the fair value of the swap agreements  net of related taxes  was an unrealized gain of this amount has been included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   there was  outstanding under the term loan   outstanding under the revolving line of credit  in outstanding letters of credit and  outstanding under the mortgage loan 
the unused balance under the revolving line of credit was  at december  the average interest rate on the borrowings outstanding at december  was approximately  including the applicable spread paid to the banks
