overview nature of our business we are an energy services holding company whose principal business is the distribution of natural gas in six states florida  georgia  maryland  new jersey  tennessee and virginia 
our six utilities serve more than million end use customers  making us the largest distributor of natural gas in the eastern united states based on number of customers 
we are also involved in various related businesses  including retail natural gas marketing to end use customers in georgia  natural gas asset management and related logistics activities for our own utilities as well as for other non affiliated companies  natural gas storage arbitrage and related activities  operation of high deliverability underground natural gas storage  and construction and operation of telecommunications conduit and fiber infrastructure within select metropolitan areas 
we manage these businesses through three operating segments distribution operations  wholesale services and energy investments and a non operating corporate segment 
the distribution operations segment is the largest component of our business and is comprehensively regulated by regulatory agencies in six states 
these agencies approve rates that are designed to provide us the opportunity to generate revenues  to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to our customers and our fixed and variable costs such as depreciation  interest  maintenance and overhead costs  and to earn a reasonable return for our shareholders 
with the exception of atlanta gas light company atlanta gas light  our largest utility franchise  the earnings of our regulated utilities are weather sensitive to varying degrees 
although various regulatory mechanisms provide a reasonable opportunity to recover our fixed costs regardless of volumes sold  the effect of weather manifests itself in terms of higher earnings during periods of colder weather and lower earnings with warmer weather 
our georgia retail marketing business  southstar energy services llc southstar  also is weather sensitive  and uses a variety of hedging strategies to mitigate potential weather impacts 
all of our utilities and southstar face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on customer preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products and the price of those products relative to that of natural gas 
we derived approximately of our earnings before interest and taxes ebit during the year ended december  from our regulated natural gas distribution business and from the sale of natural gas to end use customers in georgia by southstar  which is part of our energy investments segment 
this statistic is significant because it represents the portion of our earnings that results directly from the underlying business of supplying natural gas to retail customers 
although southstar is not subject to the same regulatory framework as our utilities  it is an integral part of the retail framework for providing gas service to end use customers in the state of georgia 
for more information regarding our measurement of ebit and the items it excludes from operating income and net income  see results of operations agl resources 
the remaining of our ebit was principally derived from businesses that are complementary to our natural gas distribution business 
we engage in natural gas asset management and operation of high deliverability natural gas underground storage as adjunct activities to our utility franchises 
these businesses allow us to be opportunistic in capturing incremental value at wholesale  provide us with deepened business insight about natural gas market dynamics and facilitate our ability  in the case of asset management  to provide transparency to regulators as to how that value can be captured to benefit our utility customers through sharing arrangements 
given the volatile and changing nature of the natural gas resource base in north america and globally  we believe that participation in these related businesses strengthens our business vitality 
our competitive strengths we believe our competitive strengths have enabled us to grow our business profitably and create significant shareholder value 
these strengths include regulated distribution assets located in growing geographic regions our operations are primarily concentrated along the east coast of the united states  from florida to new jersey 
we operate primarily urban utility franchises in growing metropolitan areas where we can deploy technology to improve service delivery and manage costs 
we believe the population growth and resulting expansion in business and construction activity in many of the areas we serve should result in increased demand for natural gas and related infrastructure for the foreseeable future 
demonstrated track record of performance through superior execution we continue to focus our efforts on generating significant incremental earnings improvements from each of our businesses 
we have been successful in achieving this goal in the past through a combination of business growth and controlling or reducing our operating expenses 
we achieved these improvements to our operations in part through the implementation of best practices in our businesses  including increased investments in enterprise technology  workforce automation and business process modernization 
proven ability to acquire and integrate natural gas assets that add significant incremental earnings we take a disciplined approach to identifying strategic natural gas assets that support our long term business plan 
for example  our november purchase of nui corporation nui  a new jersey based energy holding company with natural gas distribution operations in new jersey  florida  maryland and virginia  provides us an opportunity to leverage and strengthen one of our core competencies the efficient  low cost operation of urban natural gas franchises 
the disparity between nui s pre acquisition utility operating metrics and cost structure and those of our other utilities provides us an opportunity to achieve significant improvements in nui s business in and beyond 
in addition  our acquisition in october of the natural gas storage assets of jefferson island storage hub llc jefferson island  as discussed below  added immediate incremental earnings to our business and  given the possibilities for expansion  should provide a stable earnings stream going forward 
business accomplishments in we increased net income to million and fully diluted earnings per share to from prior year amounts 
in addition to improvements in our base distribution business and energy investments businesses  we were able to capture additional incremental net income in the wholesale natural gas market through our sequent energy management  lp sequent asset management  producer services and storage arbitrage activities 
we strengthened our position as a leading operator of natural gas utility assets in the eastern united states by acquiring nui 
we acquired jefferson island  a high deliverability salt dome gas storage facility in louisiana  which allows us to migrate into the wholesale market and capitalize on the growing market of utility and large industrial customers  producers  financial intermediaries and marketers who compete to hold firm capacity rights to store natural gas 
for more information on our acquisitions of nui and jefferson island  see note we announced our plan to acquire miles of intrastate pipeline in our georgia service area from southern natural gas  a subsidiary of el paso corporation  which should close in the second quarter of we expect this acquisition to allow us to  over time  undertake economical reconfiguration of our georgia transmission grid  integrating gas flows from the gulf coast  imported liquefied natural gas lng and our own market area lng 
we began construction of a propane air facility in virginia that will provide needed peak day demand protection for the customers of our virginia natural gas  inc virginia natural gas utility 
we continued to support a strong balance sheet by issuing million shares of agl resources common stock in november  raising net proceeds of million primarily to fund the nui and jefferson island acquisitions 
we increased our dividend for the third consecutive year 
if the current amount per quarter of per share is in effect for all of  our indicated annual rate would be per share 
areas of strategic focus in our business strategy is focused on effectively managing our gas distribution operations  optimizing our return on our assets  selectively growing our gas distribution businesses through acquisitions and developing our portfolio of closely related  unregulated businesses with an emphasis on risk management and earnings visibility 
key elements of our strategy include enhance the value and growth potential of our regulated utility operations we will seek to enhance the value and growth of our existing utility assets by managing our capital spending effectively  pursuing customer growth opportunities in each of our service areas  establishing a national reputation for excellent customer service by investing in systems  processes and people  working to achieve authorized returns in each jurisdiction and  in those jurisdictions where we have performance based rates  sharing the benefits with our customers  and maintaining earnings and rate stability through regulatory compacts that fairly balance the interests of customers and shareholders 
rapidly integrate the nui assets and achieve the resulting strategic benefits we are working to integrate nui s assets into our portfolio of businesses and to provide the associated benefits to our customers and shareholders 
our integration plan includes applying enterprise wide technology solutions and business processes that are designed to improve the key business metrics we track on a regular basis and bringing nui s operations to a level of operational and service efficiency comparable to that of our other utility businesses 
as part of this process  we also will evaluate certain nui businesses for possible divestiture  consistent with our philosophy of exiting businesses that do not support our long term strategy 
focus on maintaining strong investment grade profile and high level of liquidity we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to capital spending and improving operating margins to optimize cash flow generation 
additionally  we seek to reduce in the near term our ratio of total debt to total capitalization in order to strengthen our balance sheet and allow us to respond to the capital needs of our operating businesses 
we understand the importance of maintaining strong  investment grade credit ratings in order to support our operating and investment needs  and we intend to execute our strategy in a way that enhances our ability to maintain or improve those ratings 
achieve appropriate regulatory outcomes that support stable utility earnings we currently are involved in regulatory proceedings in georgia and tennessee 
in georgia  atlanta gas light s rate case is in process and expected to be completed by april  in tennessee  we anticipate receiving a final ruling on our appeal of a chattanooga gas company chattanooga gas rate case in the first quarter 
achieving favorable outcomes in these cases  and any other formal or informal regulatory proceedings in which we may be involved  is integral to the achievement of our earnings targets 
selectively evaluate the acquisition of natural gas assets we will selectively examine and evaluate the acquisition of natural gas distribution  gas pipeline or other gas related assets 
our acquisition criteria include the ability to generate operational synergies  strategic fit relative to our core competencies  value from near term earnings contributions and adequate returns on invested capital  while maintaining or improving our investment grade credit ratings 
selectively expand our other energy businesses we intend to continue to expand our wholesale services and natural gas storage businesses to provide disciplined incremental earnings growth for shareholders 
sequent intends to continue providing credits to our utility customers through effective management of our affiliated utility assets 
in our asset management business  we intend to grow our business with non affiliated third parties  as well as the services we provide to our affiliated utilities  by providing producers with markets for their gas commodity  providing end users with gas supply  storage and asset management options  and arbitraging pipeline and storage assets across various gas markets and time horizons 
however  we intend to continue protecting our earnings at risk by maintaining our commitment to limited open position and credit risks and by providing transparency and visibility to regulators under our asset management agreements 
as our portfolio of assets and our ability to store more physical gas inventory grow  the volatility of reported earnings from this business may increase 
in our high deliverability underground storage business  we will seek to expand the operating capabilities of our existing facilities to provide more flexible and valuable injection and withdrawal capabilities for our customers 
pivotal jefferson island  llc is currently expanding its compression capabilities to increase the number of times a customer can inject and withdraw natural gas 
we will complete and begin operation of our propane peaking facility  and look for additional opportunities to provide economical peaking services in the regions in which our utilities operate 
acquire and retain natural gas customers we continue to focus significant efforts in our distribution operations business on improving our net customer growth trends  despite the industry wide challenges of rising prices for natural gas and competition from alternative fuels  declining natural gas usage per customer and declining regional load factors 
in each of our utility service areas  we will continue to implement programs aimed at emphasizing natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and maximizing the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional opportunities 
we also are focused on similar customer growth initiatives in our southstar retail marketing business in georgia 
in addition  we continue to improve the credit quality of our customers in the retail marketing business and will use those techniques to improve credit and collections activities within our regulated utilities 
continue to improve revenue and cash flow stability we have taken a number of actions in recent years to promote more stable and predictable revenues and cash flows in each of our business segments  as well as to moderate the effects of variable factors  such as weather and natural gas prices on our business results 
some of the improvements we have initiated include performance based ratemaking treatment in georgia  weather normalization adjustment programs in virginia and tennessee  more efficient cost management and cash recovery from our environmental response cost erc program in georgia and reduced credit losses from our retail marketing business 
we estimate that in our spending for property  plant and equipment will be million compared to million in our capital expenditures should decrease in successive years by reduced spending related to the pipeline replacement program prp  a mandated regulatory program that has required significant expenditures 
we expect to improve our net cash flow  which should provide enhanced financial flexibility around business investment opportunities and potentially a return of capital to investors to provide additional shareholder value 
regulatory environment we are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of various state and federal regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
we are committed to working cooperatively and constructively with the regulatory agencies in these states  as well as with federal regulatory agencies in a way that benefits our customers  shareholders and other stakeholders 
we believe the dynamic energy environment in which we operate demands that we maintain an open  respectful and ongoing dialogue with these agencies 
this posture is the best way to ensure we are working toward common solutions to the many issues our industry faces 
these issues include the changing nature of resource availability  pricing volatility  price levels and their effect on economic development in our service territories  the likelihood of increased importation of lng and the need for reasonably priced alternatives for our customers to meet their rapidly growing peak demands 
for more information regarding pending federal and state regulatory matters  see results of operations distribution operations and results of operations wholesale services 
technology initiatives we continue to make progress with regard to several of our strategic technology initiatives 
during the third quarter of  we implemented new technological tools that enable marketers of natural gas in georgia marketers to create and input service orders directly into atlanta gas light s systems  eliminating the need for duplicate data entry or three way calls between the customer  marketers and our customer call center 
this system allowed for a reduction in the number of customer service representatives servicing marketers in our call center  while providing enhanced service to the marketers 
it also allowed us to further develop our strategy for the replacement of our customer information system  which should result in less capital investment over time than previously estimated 
in addition  we implemented our new energy trading and risk management etrm system at sequent in the fourth quarter of the etrm system is designed to enhance internal controls and provide additional transparency into the activities of sequent s business 
we also anticipate the system will enable sequent to continue to grow its commercial business without significant growth in support staff 
internal controls section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox compliance sox and related rules of the sec require management of public companies to assess the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year 
this includes disclosure of any material weaknesses in the company s internal controls over financial reporting that have been identified by management 
in addition  sox requires the company s independent auditor to attest to and report on management s annual assessment of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
we have documented  tested and assessed our systems of internal control over financial reporting  as required under sox and public accounting oversight board standard no 
 an audit of internal control over financial reporting performed in conjunction with an audit of financial statements standard no 
 which was adopted in june  to provide the basis for management s report and our independent auditor s attestation on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  we estimate our sox compliance costs in were approximately million  which include million of external costs 
there are three levels of possible deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that can be identified during our assessment phase  which are an internal control deficiency  which exists when the design or the operation of a control does not allow management or employees  in the normal course of performing their functions  to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a significant deficiency  which exists when an internal control deficiency or a combination of internal controls deficiencies adversely affects our ability to initiate  authorize  record  process or report financial data in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap such that there is a more than remote likelihood that a misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected a material weakness  which exists when a significant deficiency or a combination of significant deficiencies results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected as a result  our assessment could result in two possible outcomes at our reporting date we could conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting were designed and were operating effectively  or we could conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting were not properly designed or did not operate effectively 
a material weakness that exists at the reporting date would require our assessment to be that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective  and we would be required to disclose such material weaknesses our independent auditor is now required to issue three opinions annually  beginning with our consolidated financial statements 
first  the auditor must evaluate and opine regarding the process by which we assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
a second opinion must be issued as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
finally  the independent auditor must issue an opinion  as is normally done  as to whether our consolidated financial statements are fairly presented  in all material respects 
the scope of our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting included all of our consolidated entities except those falling under nui  which we acquired on november   and jefferson island  which we acquired on october  in accordance with the sec s published guidance  we excluded these entities from our assessment as they were acquired late in the year  and it was not possible to conduct our assessment between the date of acquisition and the end of the year 
sec rules require that we complete our assessment of the internal control over financial reporting of these entities within one year from the date of acquisition 
we have completed the assessment of the effectiveness on our internal controls over financial reporting as of december   and have concluded that our controls are operating effectively 
our report on internal control over financial reporting is included in item a  controls and procedures  and our independent auditors reports are included in
