item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
we anticipate that future expenditures including operating expenses  interest expenses and recurring principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  recurring capital expenditures  dividends to stockholders in accordance with reit requirements and distributions to unitholders  will be provided by cash generated from operations and potential peripheral land sales 
we anticipate that future development and non recurring capital expenditures will be funded from cash from operations  proceeds from land sales  future borrowings  joint venture equity contributions and proceeds from issuances of preferred and or common equity 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
access to such future capital is dependent on many factors outside of our control 
we believe that we will have access to additional capital resources sufficient to expand and develop our business and to complete the projects currently under development 
if we fail to raise the necessary capital  our immediate and long term development plans could be curtailed 
development and redevelopment financing new development projects are typically financed with construction loans  tax increment financing  our line of credit and joint venture partner equity contributions 
for development projects  after project openings and project stabilization  the projects are typically refinanced with permanent non recourse mortgage debt 
the following is a description of our capital cycle and the various funding sources used construction financing 
we typically fund approximately to of the cost of a new development with a construction loan 
this financing is generally obtained after a substantial portion of the equity contributions to a project have been made and is based upon the achievement of certain pre leasing levels 
we have relationships with multiple lenders in the construction loan market 
our construction loans generally have terms of three years with extension options for an additional two years 
interest rates typically range from to basis points over libor or euribor 
construction loans are typically guaranteed by us 
when kanam discussed below in strategic relationships is a partner in a project  we guarantee kanam s portion of the construction debt in addition to our own portion 
guarantees and interest rates are generally reduced incrementally after completion of a project based upon the achievement of interest coverage ratios ranging from to and certain other criteria 
in addition to construction debt  we historically have obtained tax increment financing to fund infrastructure costs including roads  traffic signals and interstate on and off ramps 
this financing generally takes the form of bonds that are issued by the local municipality in which the project is located  with the capital advanced as the infrastructure improvements are constructed 
this type of financing is advantageous to us because debt service is typically paid from special tax assessments levied against the project that are passed on to the tenants as part of their contractual leases  or from tax revenues generated by the project and paid by shoppers 
we have been successful in obtaining this form of financial assistance because our projects typically create new jobs  generate tax revenue and are therefore beneficial to the municipality 
the remainder of the cost of a development project is funded with equity contributed by us and  if applicable  our joint venture partners 
see strategic relationships 
these equity contributions fund the initial development costs prior to the funding of the construction loan 
our share of required equity is funded with cash from operations  including proceeds from land sales  our line of credit  excess proceeds from refinancings  sales of joint venture interests or proceeds from issuances of preferred and or common equity 
similar to development projects  our redevelopment projects are funded with cash from operations  construction loans  refinancings  tax increment financing  our line of credit  joint venture partner equity contributions and proceeds from issuances of preferred and or common equity 
permanent financing 
after a new development project opens and stabilizes  which typically occurs within months of opening  we generally refinance the construction loan with permanent non recourse mortgage debt 
we have found that the financial stability of our tenants and the stable nature of property cash flows make our projects attractive collateral for a number of real estate lenders  including commercial banks  life insurance companies and investment banks in the form of commercial mortgage backed securitizations 
we intend to permanently finance our future projects  including our redevelopment projects  in a similar manner 
acquisition financing our acquisitions to date have been financed using our line of credit  proceeds from issuances of preferred and or common equity  permanent non recourse mortgage debt and joint venture partner equity contributions 
in the event we consummate future acquisitions  we anticipate using similar financing sources  although there can be no assurance that these sources of financing will be available to us on reasonable terms or at all 
strategic relationships we have formed strategic relationships with certain developers and equity partners 
historically  these relationships have served as a source of equity for development projects  mitigated development risk and competition and provided assistance in the identification of new development opportunities and the development and expansion of lender relationships 
the following is a brief description of our strategic partnerships 
see item properties our joint venture operating properties for a table that summarizes the material terms of each of the joint ventures discussed below 
kanam kanam grund we have a long standing relationship with kanam  a german syndicator of closed and open end real estate funds  and its affiliates  which we refer to collectively as kanam 
since its inception in  kanam has invested and managed a portfolio valued at approximately billion in the united states and europe on behalf of private and institutional investors through publicly offered real estate funds and private placements 
since  kanam has invested approximately billion in equity in various projects with us 
as of december   through closed end funds  kanam has investments in the following properties operating properties construction projects arundel mills meadowlands xanadu colorado mills pittsburgh mills concord mills discover mills grapevine mills katy mills st 
louis mills the block at orange in addition to these investments  as of december   kanam owned approximately of the common partnership units of mills lp 
each unit is exchangeable under specified circumstances for  at our option  the cash equivalent of a share of our common stock or a share of our common stock 
currently  three of the thirteen members of our board of directors are principals of kanam 
kanam grund  a kanam affiliate  manages german syndicated open end real estate funds  which typically invest in stabilized real estate properties as opposed to development projects 
pursuant to a written agreement  both kanam s closed end funds and kanam grund s open end funds currently make their retail real estate investments in the united states exclusively through us 
as of december   kanam grund held an approximate equity interest in each of great mall of the bay area and opry mills 
our kanam joint venture agreements typically provide for the following material economic terms and rights preferred returns of in limited instances on each partner s capital contribution  distribution of operating cash flow based on the partners residual sharing percentages after payment of preferred return  distribution of proceeds upon a major capital event such as a sale of the property or receipt of proceeds from a refinancing to the partners so that the partners will receive  in the following order  a their respective accumulated but unpaid preferred returns  b their unreturned capital contributions and c the remaining cash  if any  based on their residual sharing percentages  and management by us of the property  subject to kanam s approval on various major decisions such as the refinancing or sale of a property 
ivanhoe cambridge in november  we opened vaughan mills located near toronto  canada 
vaughan mills was the first project we developed jointly with ivanhoe cambridge pursuant to a master agreement entered into in october under this master agreement  we agreed to examine the feasibility of jointly acquiring  developing  constructing  owning and operating one or more mills landmark centers in the provinces of ontario  quebec  alberta and or british columbia or one or more block projects in any province in canada 
the agreement generally provides that when ivanhoe cambridge jointly develops a site with us  the parties will hold their interests as tenants in common having equal interests 
it also restricts either party from developing a mills landmark center in the four specified provinces or from developing a block project anywhere in canada without first offering to the other party the right to participate equally in the development 
the agreement also prohibits either party from developing a mills landmark center within a fifty mile radius of any project developed by the parties in canada  and from developing any project having a gla in excess of  square feet within a ten mile radius of any project developed by the parties unless the individually developed project is approved by the other party 
the term of this master agreement extends through december   unless otherwise agreed by the parties 
in january  we expanded our relationship with ivanhoe cambridge beyond north america by becoming a partner in the acquisition of st 
enoch centre in glasgow  scotland 
gm trusts in august  we purchased an approximate managing member llc interest in nine regional mall properties from gm trusts defined herein as comprised of gm hourly and gm salaried pension plans and certain current and formerly affiliated pension plans which through its affiliates  currently manages over billion in total assets for affiliated and unaffiliated clients 
the nine regional mall properties jointly owned are briarwood mall in ann arbor  michigan  columbus city center in columbus  ohio  the falls  miami  florida 
hilltop mall in west contra costa county  california  lakeforest mall in gaithersburg  maryland  the mall at tuttle crossing in columbus  ohio  marley station in glen burnie  maryland  meadowood mall  reno  nevada  and stoneridge mall in pleasanton  california 
our joint venture agreements with gm trusts provides for the following material economic terms and rights distributions of available cash flow at least once per calendar month paid in the following order of priority first  to repay any partner loans advanced to the joint venture in an amount equal to the partners percentage of total loans made  and second  to each partner in an amount equal to their percentage of contributed capital  management by us of the property subject to gm trusts approval of various major decisions  including  but not limited to  refinancing or sale of a property  as the managing member of the joint ventures  we receive leasing and property management fees in accordance with the management agreement  and funds required for any redevelopment at any property will be provided by both gm trusts and us  in proportion to our ownership interests in the relevant joint ventures 
competition we believe that our direct competitors are other publicly traded retail mall development and operating companies  various other private and public retail commercial property developers  retail real estate companies  and other owners of retail real estate that engage in similar businesses 
we compete with these companies for development opportunities  potential acquisition of properties  retail tenants and shoppers 
all of our properties are located in populous areas that have other shopping centers and retail facilities and  as a result  we often confront intense competition in attracting shoppers and retailers alike 
in addition  our properties compete with the same shopping alternatives that other retailers face  including full price malls  e commerce  outlet malls  discount shopping clubs or centers  catalog companies and home shopping networks 
the intense competition for development and acquisition opportunities  retailers and shoppers may materially adversely affect our acquisition and development strategies  level of rents we can obtain  operating results and financial condition 
we believe  however  that due to our size  management experience  operating experience  ability to attract key retailers and innovative mix of shopping and entertainment  we will be able to meet competition in the retail real estate industry 
seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales peaking in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season 
as a result  a substantial portion of percentage rent is not paid until the fourth quarter 
furthermore  most new lease up occurs towards the later part of the year in anticipation of the holiday season and most vacancies occur toward the beginning of the year 
in addition  the majority of temporary tenants take occupancy in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  cash flow and occupancy levels are generally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 
this seasonality also impacts the quarter by quarter results of net operating income and funds from operations  although this impact is largely mitigated by recognizing minimum rent on a straight line basis over the term of related leases 
environmental matters we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances 
prior to purchasing a property or starting ground up development  the relevant property is subjected to a phase i audit  which involves a review of publicly available information and general property inspections  but does not necessarily involve soil sampling or ground water analysis  completed by an environmental consultant 
when recommended by the phase i audits  we order a phase ii audit to further investigate any issues raised in the phase i audit 
in each case where phase i or phase ii audits resulted in specific recommendations for remedial actions required by law  we have either taken or scheduled the recommended action 
we are not aware of any environmental condition that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations before consideration of any potential insurance coverage 
nevertheless  it is possible that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
moreover  no assurances can be given that a future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or b the current environmental condition of our properties has not been or will not be affected by tenants and occupants of our properties  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our properties or by third parties unrelated to us 
see item business risk factors risks associated with our properties we could incur significant costs related to environmental issues 
segments we consider each of our properties a separate operating segment that are aggregated and reported as a single segment 
insurance we carry comprehensive liability  fire  flood  terrorism  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar properties 
we also carry comprehensive earthquake and pollution cleanup coverage on all our properties and we carry off premises power coverage for each of our mills projects 
in addition  for sawgrass mills  we carry sinkhole coverage 
although we believe our properties currently are adequately covered by insurance consistent with the level of coverage that is standard in our industry  we cannot predict at this time if we will be able to obtain adequate coverage at a reasonable cost in the future 
tax status we conduct our operations in a way intended to qualify us as a reit under the internal revenue code of the code 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on our net taxable income that we currently distribute to stockholders 
qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to meet certain share ownership requirements and various qualification tests including dividend distribution  asset ownership and income tests prescribed in the code 
notwithstanding our status as a reit  however  we have to pay certain taxes  including a certain state and local income taxes  because not all states and localities treat reits the same as they are treated for federal income tax purposes  and b certain foreign income and other taxes to the extent that we own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions 
moreover  each of our domestic taxable reit subsidiaries is subject to federal  state and local corporate income taxes on its net income  while each of our non us taxable reit subsidiaries may be subject to certain foreign corporate level income taxes 
capital stock and mlp unit ownership at december   tmc had the following number of common and preferred shares authorized and outstanding 
number of shares authorized number of shares outstanding common stock  par value non voting common stock  par value preferred stock series b cumulative redeemable  par value series c cumulative redeemable  par value series d cumulative redeemable  par value series e cumulative redeemable  par value series f convertible cumulative redeemable  par value undesignated preferred stock mills lp has  series d preferred units outstanding which are convertible on a one for one basis into tmc series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock  none of which were outstanding as of december  as of december   mills lp had  common partnership units outstanding of which tmc owned 
one percent of the aggregate number of units outstanding of all classes is required to be held by tmc as a general partner interest 
each common partnership unit of mills lp other than those owned by tmc is exchangeable in accordance with mills lp s partnership agreement for  in our sole discretion  the cash equivalent of a share of our common stock or for a share of our common stock 
to date  tmc has always issued shares of its common stock in exchange for the mills lp common partnership units redeemed 
in addition to the common partnership units  mills lp has issued preferred units in the same quantity and class as the corresponding series issued by tmc 
all of mills lp s preferred units  except for the series d preferred units  are currently held by tmc 
in each case  the preferred units have terms that substantially mirror the economic terms of the corresponding series of tmc s preferred stock 
state of incorporation tmc was originally incorporated in the commonwealth of virginia in and reincorporated in the state of delaware in mills lp was formed in the state of delaware in corporate headquarters we maintain our executive offices at wilson boulevard  suite  arlington  virginia our telephone number is in february  we entered into a lease for a new corporate headquarters located in chevy chase  maryland

you should consider carefully the following material risks  together with the other information contained in and incorporated by reference in this form k  and the descriptions included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
risks associated with real estate we face risks associated with numerous international  national  regional and local economic and real estate conditions that are not in our control  any or all of which could adversely affect our properties and our business 
we are subject to various economic conditions and trends that may adversely affect our business 
these conditions include slowdown of the us national economy or a recession  slowdown of the regional and local economic climate due to plant closings  industry slowdowns  natural disasters and other factors  and negative population trends 
in addition  we currently have operating properties in spain  canada and scotland  are pursuing opportunities in other countries and are therefore subject to similar risks as they relate to those countries and the international community 
furthermore  as a real estate company  any negative trends in the following may adversely affect our properties and business the attractiveness of our property as compared to our competitors properties based on considerations such as convenience of location  rental rates and safety record  increased operating costs  including increased real property taxes  insurance and utilities costs  slowdown of local real estate conditions  such as an oversupply of retail space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area  and changing trends in the demand by consumers for merchandise offered by retailers conducting business at our properties 
moreover  other factors may adversely affect us  including changes in government regulations and other laws  rules and regulations governing real estate  zoning or taxes  changes in interest rate levels  the availability of financing and potential liability under environmental and other laws and other unforeseen events  most of which are discussed elsewhere in these risk factors 
any or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our properties and our business 
because real estate investments are illiquid  we may not be able to sell our properties in response to economic changes 
real estate investments generally are relatively illiquid and as a result cannot be sold quickly in response to changes in the economy or other conditions when it may be prudent to do so 
this inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our properties could adversely affect our business and ability to meet our debt obligations and distribute earnings to our stockholders and unitholders 
we may be unable to compete with our competitors and other alternatives to our portfolio of properties 
the commercial retail real estate business is highly competitive 
we compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers  many of whom have significant financial resources  revenues and geographical diversity 
furthermore  we compete for tenants with other property owners 
our properties compete with a variety of shopping alternatives including full price malls  e commerce  outlet malls  discount shopping clubs or centers  catalog companies and home shopping networks 
we are subject to significant regulation that inhibits our activities 
local zoning and use laws  environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our development  expansion  redevelopment and reconstruction activities 
these regulations may prevent or delay us from taking advantage of economic opportunities 
we cannot predict what laws and regulations may be enacted nor their potential impact on us 
risks associated with our properties we may be unable to develop new properties or expand existing properties successfully 
we continue to develop new projects and expand existing properties  and may engage in the development of other retail or related mixed use projects  as opportunities arise 
however  there are significant risks associated with our development activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of established retail properties 
while we have policies in place designed to limit the risks associated with development  these policies do not mitigate all development risks associated with a project 
these risks include the following significant expenditure of money and time on projects that may be delayed or never be completed  higher than projected construction costs  shortage of construction materials and supplies  failure to obtain zoning  occupancy or other governmental approvals or to the extent required  tenant approvals  and late completion because of construction delays  delays in the receipt of zoning  occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control 
any or all of these factors may impede our development strategy and adversely affect our overall business 
we may be unable to lease new properties or renew leases or re lease space at our existing properties as leases expire  which may adversely affect our operating results 
our tenants generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from three to years 
as leases expire at our existing properties  tenants may elect not to renew them 
we may not be able to re lease the property on similar terms  if we are able to re lease the property at all  due to a variety of reasons  including competition from other retailers 
in addition  for new properties  we may be unable to attract enough tenants and the occupancy rates and rents may not be sufficient to make the property profitable 
if we are unable to re lease spaces at our existing properties on economically favorable lease terms or to lease spaces at our new properties  our operating results will be negatively affected 
in addition  our leases with a number of tenants contain covenants restricting the use of other space in our properties or requiring the presence of other specified co tenants 
our failure to rent vacant space on a timely basis or at all would likely adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
competition may cause the occupancy and rental rates of our properties to decrease 
we compete with other companies that are engaged in the development or ownership of retail properties for prime locations and for tenants who lease space in the retail properties that we and our competitors own or operate 
the development by our competitors of new super regional malls or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract our tenants to our competitors or may cause them to seek lease terms that are less favorable to us at or prior to renewal  and accordingly may adversely affect our business and the revenues that we derive from  and the value of  our properties 
we have been and may continue to be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and downturns in tenants businesses  which may adversely affect our operating results and reduce our cash flow 
a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition due to a slowing economy generally or a downturn in the retail sector 
a tenant s retail business may also be adversely effected by increasing competition from traditional full price malls  e commerce  outlet malls  discount shopping clubs and centers  catalog companies and home shopping networks 
as a result  our tenants may delay lease commencement  cease or defer making rental payments or declare bankruptcy 
in addition  the financial difficulty of a larger tenant  especially an anchor tenant  could materially adversely affect customer traffic in a property  thereby triggering  among other things  other tenants rights to terminate their leases or reduce their rental rates 
if a tenant files for bankruptcy  the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate its lease and we cannot be sure that it will affirm its leases and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
we also cannot be sure that we will be able to lease vacant space in our properties on economically favorable terms 
although in we were not materially affected by any bankruptcies of our in line or anchor tenants  any of these events occurring in the future may negatively affect our operating results and reduce our cash flows 
we may be unable to successfully integrate and effectively manage the properties we acquire 
we have acquired a number of properties since and  subject to the availability of financing and other considerations  we intend to continue to acquire properties or interests in properties that we believe will be profitable or will enhance the value of our portfolio 
the success of these acquisitions will depend  in part  on our ability to efficiently integrate the acquired properties and employees into our organization  and apply our business  operating  administrative  financial and accounting strategies and controls to the acquired properties 
in addition  we plan on expanding or redeveloping some of these recently acquired properties 
such expansion and redevelopment activities pose the same risks that are inherent in our development activities as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k and pose additional risks that are unique to expansion and redevelopment efforts  such as the uncertainty of obtaining tenant approvals 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the acquired properties into our operations  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we continue to pursue opportunities in non us markets that are subject to foreign currency risks due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have pursued and plan to continue to pursue opportunities in markets where the us dollar is not the national currency 
as a result  we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar 
for example  a significant depreciation in the value of the foreign currencies of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially adversely affect our performance 
we are evaluating hedging strategies to mitigate such effects  although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in mitigating all the risks 
we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from our acquisitions  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we will continue to acquire properties that we believe will enhance our future financial performance 
our belief is based on and is subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are forward looking and are uncertain in nature or are beyond our control 
in addition  some of these properties may have unknown characteristics or deficiencies or may not complement our portfolio of existing properties 
as a result  some properties may have less value or may generate less revenue than we believed at the time of the acquisition  negatively affecting our operating results 
we could incur significant costs related to environmental issues 
under some environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real property  and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of on real property  may be liable for the costs of investigating  and the remediation of  hazardous substances on or under or released from the property and for damages to natural resources 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation liability act  and similar state laws  impose liability on a joint and several basis  regardless of whether the owner  operator or other responsible party knew of or was at fault for the release or presence of hazardous substances 
in connection with the ownership or operation of our properties  we could be liable for costs associated with investigation and remediation in the future 
the costs of any required remediation and related liability as to any property could be substantial under these laws and could exceed the value of the property and or our aggregate assets 
the presence of hazardous substances  or the failure to properly remediate those substances  also may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral 
in addition  environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which we use our properties or operate our business  and these restrictions may require expenditures for compliance 
we cannot assure you that a material environmental claim or compliance obligation will not arise in the future 
the costs of defending against any claims of liability  of the remediation of a contaminated property  or of complying with future environmental requirements could be substantial and affect our operating results 
such expansion and redevelopment activities pose the same risks that are inherent in development activities 
uninsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition 
although we have commercial general liability insurance and property insurance  see item business insurance  there are some types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as wars or acts of god  which may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should a property suffer an uninsured loss  we could lose our invested capital in and anticipated profits and future revenues from that property 
additionally  in the case of recourse construction loans  we may remain obligated under those loans and any other financial obligations on that property 
an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits may negatively impact our financial condition 
risks associated with our indebtedness and financing we have substantial indebtedness and we require significant cash flow to make required payments on our indebtedness 
we rely heavily on debt financing for our business 
as of december   we had total consolidated debt of approximately billion 
we have also guaranteed selected outstanding unconsolidated joint venture debt  which guarantees expire upon the achievement of specified financial performance tests 
we expect to make similar guarantees in connection with our future developments and to continue to rely on debt to finance our future developments and acquisitions 
due to our high level of debt  our cash flow may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest 
if a property were mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we were unable to make mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose upon that property  appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies 
we may be unable to repay our existing indebtedness as it matures  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
most of our indebtedness does not require significant principal payments prior to maturity 
however  we will need to raise additional equity capital  obtain secured or unsecured debt financing  issue private or public debt  or sell some of our assets to either refinance or repay our indebtedness as it matures 
we cannot assure you that these sources of financing or refinancing will be available to us on reasonable terms or at all 
the potential inability to obtain financing or refinancing to repay our maturing indebtedness  and the potential inability to refinance existing indebtedness on reasonable terms  may require us to make higher interest and principal payments  issue additional equity securities  or sell some of our assets on disadvantageous terms  all or any of which may result in a partial or complete loss on our investment and otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operation 
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing  which would negatively impact our business 
as of december   our pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated borrowings totaled approximately billion and represented approximately of our total market capitalization 
total market capitalization represents the sum of the outstanding indebtedness  the total liquidation preference of all our preferred equity and the total market value of our common equity  based on the closing price of tmc common stock as of december  our leverage and any future increases in our leverage could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes which would negatively impact our business overall 
due to the significant amount of our variable rate debt  rising interest rates would adversely affect our results of operations 
as of december   we had billion of variable rate consolidated debt outstanding 
while we have sought to refinance our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or cap our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using interest rate swap agreements where appropriate  a significant increase in interest rates would adversely affect our results of operations 
we have entered into loan agreements that impose a number of restrictive covenants that may hinder our operational flexibility and violation of these restrictive covenants would carry serious consequences 
the agreements governing our line of credit and term loan impose numerous restrictive financial and operating covenants on us  including covenants that limit our ability to a incur additional debt  b sell assets  c repurchase our securities and d engage in mergers and consolidations 
for example  under the terms of our line of credit and term loan  the lenders may accelerate payment and may pursue standard remedies upon a violation of any covenant 
these restrictions may negatively impact our flexibility in conducting our operations and violations of these covenants may have adverse consequences to us 
we depend on third party financing for our development  expansion and acquisition activities 
as we continue to develop or acquire new retail properties or expand existing properties  we anticipate that we will finance these activities through lines of credit  other forms of secured or unsecured debt  including construction financing and permanent debt  and contributions from joint venture partners 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund new development  project expansions or our acquisition activities on terms favorable to us or at all 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our joint venture partners will make their required capital contributions 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient levels of third party financing to fund our growth  our business will be negatively impacted 
risks associated with our joint ventures our joint venture agreements contain various rights including put call  buy sell  redemption and guaranty provisions and obligations that could impose a significant financial burden on us 
many of our joint venture agreements with kanam include put call provisions  under which kanam may be entitled  under certain circumstances  such as a change in control of us  to require that we buy their interest in the joint venture 
further  one of our joint venture agreements with kanam contains obligations for us to redeem their interest in the venture if certain conditions have not been satisfied  such as securing construction or other loans by specified dates  or require us to guarantee the payment of specified priority returns 
in the case of our great mall and opry projects  kanam grund has the ability to cause the sale of the properties at any time 
if we are unwilling or unable to purchase their interest  we may be required to sell the properties at a time when we otherwise may not have wished to sell the projects and we will lose the revenues and profits that we otherwise would have earned on these properties 
additionally  many of our joint venture agreements include buy sell provisions under which  upon the occurrence of certain events or passage of time  we must either purchase the other partner s joint venture interest or sell our joint venture interest to our partner 
there is no assurance that we will be financially able to purchase the joint venture interests  and therefore we may be forced to sell our interests and lose the revenues and profits that we otherwise would have earned on these properties 
we must share decision making with our joint venture partners 
we have invested and expect in the future to invest as a co venturer or partner in the development of some of our new properties  instead of developing projects on our own 
these shared investments may involve risks not present in a wholly owned development project that stem from us not having control over the development  financing  leasing  management and other aspects of the project 
we may not have the right to take some significant actions without the approval of our joint venture partners  which approvals they may not grant  even if we think such actions would be in the best interests of the joint ventures and the properties 
for example  we generally need the other joint venturer s approval before selling or refinancing a joint venture s property  setting an annual budget  entering into specified transactions with affiliates and settling litigation above specified thresholds 
if they do not provide their consents to actions that we believe are necessary and in the best interests of the joint ventures  our joint venture properties and our overall business may suffer 
additionally  our co venturer might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and may take actions that are contrary to our instructions  requests or interests  or otherwise hinder us from accomplishing our goals 
our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent 
actions by a joint venture partner could subject the joint venture assets to additional risk 
risks associated with our capital stock and units the market value of tmc capital stock can be adversely affected by numerous factors 
partnership units of mills lp are redeemable for either cash or shares of tmc s common stock and as a result  the value of mills lp s common partnership units are closely tied to the value of tmc s capital stock 
as with any publicly traded company  the market value of tmc s capital stock may be negatively affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following general decline in the capital markets  level of institutional interest in our equity securities  perception of reits generally and reits with portfolios similar to ours  attractiveness of equity securities of reits generally compared to other publicly traded companies  the market s perception of our business and dividend growth potential  government action or regulation  our earnings and cash distributions  increases in market interest rates  which may make our stock less attractive to investors unless we increase our dividend rate  the relatively low daily trading volume of equity securities of reits in general  and our ability to invest the proceeds of offerings of securities in a manner that will increase earnings per share 
in addition  issuances of a substantial number of shares of tmc capital stock  or the mere perception that such issuances may occur  could adversely affect the market value of tmc s capital stock 
this is particularly true with tmc s common stock  a substantial number of shares of which we may issue in connection with the exercise of outstanding options  redemption of outstanding mills lp partnership units and for future financing needs 
during  we issued a number of shares of our common stock in connection with the redemption of partnership units by mills lp s unit holders and expect  although cannot state with certainty  that the unit holders of mills lp will continue to redeem their partnership units in the future 
we cannot predict what effect future issuances and sales of tmc capital stock  or the mere perception that such issuance may occur  will have on the value of such capital stock or common units 
a significant decrease in the market price of tmc s capital stock would make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of such capital stock 
we may not have sufficient cash flow or assets to make distributions to holders of one or more classes of our capital stock and or units 
our ability to make distributions to our equity holders depends on our ability first to cover our operating and related expenses and satisfy our obligations to our creditors 
in addition  we have different classes of capital stock and units outstanding  some of which have a different priority as to the distribution of dividends relative to others 
for example  holders of our outstanding preferred equity are entitled to receive their distributions prior to our common equity holders 
generally  the terms of each different class of our preferred equity prohibits us from making distributions and all other payments to holders of our common equity and all other equity securities junior in right to such class of preferred equity  unless we have paid all accrued distributions on such class of preferred equity or set apart funds for payment of the distributions due to holders of such class of preferred equity 
as a result  if we do not have sufficient cash remaining for our distributions  holders of one or more classes of our capital stock and units may not receive any distributions 
also  in the event of a bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization or similar proceeding  our creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from our assets before any assets are made available for distribution to our equity holders 
in every case  the holders of capital stock and units will have the right to participate in any distribution of our assets only after the claims of our creditors and holders of our priority capital stock and units are satisfied 
risks associated with our organization a number of our directors and significant stockholders may exert substantial influence over us 
as of december   kanam owned of the outstanding partnership units of mills lp and was our joint venture partner in eight operating properties and two development projects 
in addition  kanam grund is our joint venture partner in two additional operating properties 
three of our thirteen directors are affiliated with kanam 
these three directors may have significant influence over us as members of our board 
the interests of these directors may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders in connection with kanam s joint ventures with mills lp to develop  own  and operate additional properties  and they may use their voting influence contrary to our other stockholders interests 
the kanam entities may exchange all or a substantial portion of the units that they hold for shares of our common stock 
if they do so  they will increase their influence over us and over the outcome of any matters submitted to our stockholders for approval 
the influence and voting power of our other stockholders may diminish accordingly 
tmc is the sole general partner of mills lp and has fiduciary responsibilities to the other partners of mill lp 
as a result  we may be in a position where we have duties to others whose interests conflict with those of tmc s stockholders 
tmc  as the sole general partner of mills lp  may have fiduciary responsibilities to the other partners in mills lp that may conflict with the interests of tmc s stockholders  including decisions regarding the sale or refinancing of our properties and the timing and amount of distributions from mills lp 
in addition  individuals and entities  including certain of our executive officers and our directors including those who are affiliated with kanam and their respective affiliates that hold units of mills lp may have limited rights in decisions affecting mills lp that may conflict with the interests of tmc s common stockholders 
in particular  a holder of mills lp units may suffer different and or more adverse tax consequences than a tmc stockholder does on the sale or refinancing of some of our properties as a result of unrealized gain attributable to such properties that is allocable to such holder or the tax status of the unit holder 
these mills lp unit holders  therefore  may have objectives different from tmc s regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any sale or refinancing 
tmc s certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
in some instances  a change in control of tmc could give the holders of tmc common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of those securities 
provisions in tmc s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from trying to acquire tmc even if a change in control were in the best interests of tmc s stockholders 
under tmc s certificate of incorporation currently in effect  tmc s board of directors has the authority  without a vote of stockholders  to issue up to an additional  shares of tmc preferred stock and to establish the rights and preferences of any class or series of preferred stock to be issued  which rights and preferences could delay or prevent a change in control 
further  no holder  with limited exceptions  may beneficially own more than of tmc securities  which may have the effect of precluding a third party from acquiring control of tmc even if a change in control were in the best interests of tmc s stockholders 
in addition  tmc s board of directors is a classified board composed of three classes of directors with staggered terms 
directors for each class are elected for a three year term upon the expiration of the term of the current class 
a classified board of directors makes it more difficult to effect a change in control and may discourage an attempt by a third party even if a change in control were in tmc s stockholders best interests 
a number of our joint venture partnership agreements contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
our kanam joint venture agreements contain put call rights that may be exercised upon a change in control 
these rights allow kanam to require us to purchase their entire interest in the joint venture 
we are required to pay for any purchase of such partner s joint venture interests  at our option  in cash or with units of mills lp 
the required payments may have the effect of discouraging a third party from undertaking a change in control of tmc  even if a change in control were in the best interests of tmc s stockholders 
for the purpose of determining when put call rights may be exercised  each of the following events is a change in control unless such event is approved by the members of tmc s board of directors who are affiliates of kanam we participate in any consolidation  merger or corporate reorganization in which more than of tmc s outstanding voting securities are transferred  any person or group  other than kanam and its affiliates  becomes the beneficial owner  directly or indirectly  of more than of tmc s then outstanding combined voting securities  and a person  whose nomination for election as director was not recommended by the governance and nominating committee of tmc s board of directors  is elected as a director to tmc s board of directors 
risks associated with income tax laws and accounting pronouncements tmc s failure to qualify as a reit would have adverse tax consequences to us and our equity holders 
we believe that we have been organized and have conducted our operations in a manner so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the code  and we currently intend to continue to operate tmc as a reit in the future 
we cannot assure you  however  that tmc currently qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit 
many of the reit requirements are highly technical and complex and depend on various factual matters and circumstances that may not be completely within our control  such as actions taken by our joint venture partners 
if tmc fails to qualify as a reit and any available relief provisions do not apply it will not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing its taxable income  it will be subject to federal and state income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  and unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  it will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which its qualification was lost 
any determination that tmc does not qualify as a reit would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of tmc common stock  as the additional tax liability to us for the year or years involved would reduce our net earnings available for investment  debt service or distribution to our equity holders 
furthermore  we would no longer be required by the code to make any distributions to tmc s stockholders as a condition to reit qualification 
our failure to qualify tmc as a reit would cause all of our distributions to tmc stockholders  to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits  to be taxable as regular corporate dividends 
this means that tmc stockholders taxed as individuals currently would be taxed on those dividends at capital gains rates and corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such distributions  subject  in each case  to applicable limitations under the code 
if we make distributions to tmc stockholders in reliance on its continued qualification as a reit  we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay the taxes that would result from the actual failure to qualify tmc as a reit 
even if tmc currently qualifies as a reit  new tax rules or legislation may affect whether it continues to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification 
despite tmc s reit status  we remain subject to various taxes 
notwithstanding tmc s status as a reit  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign taxes on our income and property 
for example  we will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of our reit taxable income including capital gains 
additionally  we may have to pay some state or local income taxes because not all states and localities treat reits the same as they are treated for federal income tax purposes 
we may also have to pay some foreign taxes as a result of our ownership and operation of assets in foreign jurisdictions 
mills lp is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all taxes  and any related interest and penalties  incurred by us 
our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as corporations and pay federal  state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates  and pay foreign taxes to the extent they own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to special rules that may result in increased taxes 
for example  our taxable reit subsidiaries are limited in their ability to deduct interest payments made to us 
in addition  we will be required to pay a penalty tax on some payments that we receive if the economic arrangements between us  our tenants and our taxable reit subsidiaries are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties or if we receive payments for property held for sale in the ordinary course of business 
under existing law  whether property  including properties like the centers owned by mills lp  is held for sale in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular transaction 
we intend that we will hold our properties for investment  with a view to long term appreciation  to engage in the business of acquiring and owning properties that fit within our portfolio objectives and to make occasional sales of properties as are consistent with our investment objectives 
we cannot guarantee that sales of our properties  or portions of our properties  would not be subject to the penalty tax unless we comply with certain statutory safe harbor provisions 
the need to avoid prohibited transactions could cause us to forego or defer sales of our properties that we might otherwise have sold or that might otherwise be in our best interest to sell or to own and sell such properties through a taxable reit subsidiary 
a taxable reit subsidiary would be subject to a corporate level tax on its taxable income attributable to such sales 
to the extent that we or our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal  state  local or foreign taxes  we will have less cash available for investment  debt service and distribution to our equity holders 
if the internal revenue service  or irs  were to challenge successfully mills lp s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  tmc would cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences 
we believe that mills lp qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
as a partnership  it is not subject to federal income tax on its income 
instead  each of its partners  including tmc  is required to pay tax on its allocable share of mills lp s income 
we cannot assure you  however  that the irs will not challenge mills lp s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  or that a court would not sustain an irs challenge 
if the irs were successful in treating mills lp as a corporation for tax purposes  tmc would fail to meet the income tests and some of the asset tests applicable to reits and  accordingly  cease to qualify as a reit 
also  the failure of mills lp to qualify as a partnership would cause mills lp to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax  which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for investment  debt service and distribution to mills lp s unit holders  including tmc 
as a reit  tmc is subject to limitations on our ownership of debt and equity securities 
subject to certain exceptions  including the one discussed in this paragraph  a reit is generally prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer if the value of those securities exceeds of the value of the reit s total assets or the securities owned by the reit represent more than of the issuer s outstanding voting securities or more than of the value of the issuer s outstanding securities 
a reit is permitted to own securities of its taxable reit subsidiaries in an amount that exceeds the value test and the vote or value test  but the aggregate value of such securities may not represent more than of the value of the reit s total assets 
certain of our subsidiaries  including millsservices corp 
and each corporate subsidiary in which it owns at least of the outstanding voting securities or of the value of the outstanding securities  have elected to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries 
while we believe that we have satisfied these limitations on the ownership of securities during each of the taxable years that each such limitation applied to us  given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits which complexity is exacerbated when a reit owns its properties through partnerships  as we do and the ongoing importance of factual determinations  we cannot provide any assurance that the irs would agree with our determinations 
if you redeem your units  you may incur adverse tax consequences 
the exercise of your right to require the redemption of your units will be treated for tax purposes as a sale of your units 
this sale will be fully taxable to you  and you will be treated as realizing for tax purposes an amount equal to the sum of the cash or the value of the common shares received in the exchange plus the amount of our liabilities considered allocable to the redeemed units at the time of the redemption  including our share of the liabilities of certain entities in which we own an interest 
depending upon your particular circumstances  it is possible that the amount of gain recognized  or even the tax liability resulting from that gain  could exceed the amount of cash and the value of other property  such as the tmc common shares  received upon the disposition 
you may be subject to adverse consequences if you attempt to acquire shares in excess of of tmc capital stock  including through the redemption of units of mills lp 
for tmc to protect its qualification as a reit  ownership of its capital stock  directly or by virtue of the applicable attribution provisions of the code  by any person or persons acting as a group is limited to of its outstanding capital stock 
any transfer that would cause a violation of this ownership limit  including through the redemption of units of mills lp  will result in the immediate conversion of the excess shares into shares of excess stock that are non voting and that may not participate in distributions except for distributions in the event of tmc s liquidation 
the shares of excess stock would be immediately transferred to us as trustee of a trust for the exclusive benefit of beneficiaries that the person acquiring such shares may designate  subject to our right to purchase the shares for fair consideration 
you may be subject to adverse consequences if you are not a us person and you attempt to acquire shares of tmc s capital stock  including through the redemption of our units 
provisions in tmc s certificate of incorporation are intended to ensure that we maintain our status as a reit by rendering void transfers of tmc shares that will jeopardize our status as a reit and by eliminating rights of the shares of transferred stock 
under these provisions  if you are not a us person and you acquire shares of tmc s capital stock  including through the redemption of our units  the acquisition of which causes less than of tmc s capital stock to be owned by us persons  the shares that you acquire will convert immediately into shares of excess stock that will be non voting and that may not participate in distributions except for distributions in the event of our liquidation 
these shares of excess stock would be immediately transferred to us as trustee of a trust for the exclusive benefit of beneficiaries that you may designate  subject to our right to purchase the shares for fair consideration 
further instances of ineffectiveness in our internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on us 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and stock price 
we announced that we would restate our financial statements for the fiscal years ended december    and and for the quarters ended march  june and september  to correct accounting primarily relating to our treatment of equity in earnings from joint ventures  the capitalization of interest and certain other costs  and the timing of gains on sales of partnership interests 
in connection with our restatement  we have implemented new procedures  however  we cannot assure you that we will not discover that there have been further instances of ineffectiveness in our internal controls over financial reporting 
in the process of documenting and testing our internal control procedures over financial reporting to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  we identified that the control deficiency that resulted in the inappropriate selection  application and monitoring of accounting policies represented a material weakness 
we have implemented additional review procedures over the selection  application and monitoring of accounting policies 
if we fail to successfully address the identified weakness and implement an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
consequently  our financial results could be adversely affected causing investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the value of our stock could drop significantly

diversified tenant base because our properties contain various retail formats under one roof  we believe that our tenant base represents one of the more diversified mixes of retailers in the industry

as of december   we had an average of tenants per property and no single tenant accounted for more than of our base rent or of our aggregate gla

av associates will receive a construction period preference equal to and a priority return during operations equal to per annum on its qualifying initial capital contribution and per annum on its qualifying additional capital contributions 
mills kan am pittsburgh will receive a cumulative construction period preference equal to  a priority return during operations equal to per annum on its qualifying initial capital contributions and per annum on its qualifying additional capital contributions

item legal proceedings in march  hartz mountain industries  inc  or hartz  filed a lawsuit in the superior court of new jersey  law division  for bergen county  seeking to enjoin the new jersey sports and exposition authority  or njsea  from entering into a contract with us and mack cali for the redevelopment of the continental arena site 
in may  the court denied hartz s request for an injunction and dismissed its suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies 
in june  the njsea held hearings on hartz s protest  and on a parallel protest filed by another rejected developer  westfield  inc  or westfield 
on september   the njsea ruled against hartz s and westfield s protests 
hartz  westfield and four taxpayers thereafter filed appeals from the njsea s final decision 
in january  hartz and westfield also appealed the njsea s approval and execution of the formal redevelopment agreement with the mills lp 
by decision dated may   the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey rejected hartz s contention that the njsea lacks statutory authority to allow retail development of its property 
the supreme court of new jersey has declined to review the appellate division s decision 
several appeals filed by hartz  westfield and others  including certain environmental groups  that challenge certain approvals received by the mills lp from the njsea  the new jersey meadowlands commission and the new jersey department of environmental protection remain pending before the appellate division 
the appellate division  in a decision rendered on november   completed its review of hartz s open public records act appeal and the remand proceeding it earlier ordered and upheld the findings of the law division in the remand proceeding 
hartz has petitioned the supreme court of new jersey to review the appellate division s decision and that petition remains pending 
the njsea held further hearings on december and   at hartz s request to review certain additional facts in support of its bid protest 
the njsea conducted further hearings on the bid protest of hartz and westfield on december and  on march   the hearing officer rendered his supplemental report and recommendation to the njsea  finding no merit in the protests presented by hartz and westfield 
the njsea accepted the hearing officer s supplemental report and recommendation on march  on march   the sierra club  the new jersey public interest group citizen lobby  inc and the new jersey environmental federation filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey  challenging a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers in connection with the project and seeking a preliminary injunction to stop certain fill activities on the project site 
we believe that mills lp s proposal and the planned project fully comply with applicable laws  and intend to continue our vigorous defense of our rights under the executed redevelopment agreement and recently executed ground lease 
we do not believe that the pending appeals will have any material affect on our ability to develop the project

we have made consecutive quarterly distributions since our initial public offering in high low dividends first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in february  our board of directors approved an increase in tmc s quarterly dividend rate and mills lp quarterly distribution rate to per share of common stock or unit commencing with the first quarter of payable in may our ability to make dividend distributions depends on a number of factors  including net cash provided by operating activities  financial condition  capital commitments  debt repayment schedules and other factors 
holders of tmc common stock and mills lp common partnership units are entitled to receive distributions when  as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose 
in order to qualify as a reit  tmc is required to make dividend distributions to its stockholders 
the amount of these distributions must equal at least the sum of a of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and b of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus the sum of certain non cash income items over of our reit taxable income computed without regard to dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain 
for federal income tax purposes  dividend distributions may consist of ordinary income  capital gains  nontaxable return of capital or a combination of those items 
dividend distributions that exceed tmc s current and accumulated earnings and profits calculated for tax purposes constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend  which reduces a stockholder s basis in the shares of common stock and will not be taxable to the extent that the dividend distribution equals or is less than the stockholder s basis in the stock 
to the extent a dividend distribution exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder s basis in the stock  that dividend distribution will be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder s stock

restatement we announced on february   that we would restate our audited financial results for the fiscal years ended december  and  and our unaudited quarterly results for the first three quarters of to correct our accounting treatment of various items to conform with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the following describes the significant aspects of the restatement 
equity in earnings 
we changed our method of computing our equity in the earnings of our joint ventures and have applied the change retroactively to the origination of our involvement in each of these joint ventures 
previously  we used an estimate of our economic ownership in the joint venture based on projected cash flows 
the method reflected in the restatement  allocates income to equity participants based on the terms of the respective partnership agreements upon an assumed liquidation of the joint venture at its depreciated book value as of the end of the reporting period 
capitalized interest 
we changed our method for capitalizing the interest on borrowings made to fund our development and other construction projects 
previously  we capitalized interest using computed rates on excess proceeds from refinancing various loans based on an incremental interest cost approach 
the amount we now capitalize is based on the stated interest rates  including amortization of deferred financing costs 
the calculation includes interest costs that theoretically could have been avoided  based first on project specific borrowings then on an assumed repayment of our highest rate debt  had the underlying development and construction activities not been undertaken 
other capitalized costs 
we changed our accounting for leasing and financing overhead to expense these costs as incurred to the extent of our partners interests in the underlying entities 
we previously capitalized these costs and expensed them as the related fees were recognized 
we also corrected our accounting for lease inducements to amortize them against revenue over the life of the lease 
gain on sale of joint venture interests 
in the third quarter of  we reported a sale of partial interests in three joint ventures and recognized an aggregate gain of million 
due to our continuing involvement in the joint ventures  statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for sales of real estate  or sfas  precluded us from recognizing the transactions as sales in in the restatement  we recorded the sales and related gains in the second quarter of when the underlying joint venture agreements were amended to remove the terms comprising the continuing involvement 
promotion funds 
under our lease agreements  tenants are required to fund costs associated with promoting the property 
the restatement reflects amounts received from tenants as recoveries from tenants and the associated expenses are reflected as recoverable from tenants 
these amounts had previously been presented on a net basis 
currently  revenues in excess of expenses are deferred until the associated costs are incurred and promotion costs are expensed as incurred 
other 
in conjunction with the restatement  we also made adjustments to our accounting for various other miscellaneous items  including i calculating straight line rent from the date the tenant takes control of the space  rather than our previous practice of recognizing rent as of the lease commencement date  ii the correction of some purchase price adjustments  and iii restating gains on residual land sales from joint ventures to expense capitalized interest upon sale 
in addition  we have grossed up our income statement to no longer net certain fees and the costs incurred to earn those fees 
adoption of fin in our form q for the period ended march   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin and applied it prospectively 
at that time  we did not include all of our joint ventures with kanam in the consolidation 
we have since determined that our joint ventures with kanam and its affiliates are variable interest entities and that we are the primary beneficiary of each of these joint ventures based on a comparison of our voting rights relative to our obligation to absorb expected losses or right to receive residual returns 
as a result  we have consolidated twelve previously excluded kanam joint ventures effective march  in total the joint ventures consolidated upon the adoption of fin had total assets of  million and total liabilities of  million 
the fin adoption also resulted in the recordation  as of march   of a cumulative effect adjustment to increase earnings by million  net of minority interest of million  reflecting additional capitalized interest as if the entities had been consolidated during their respective construction periods  some of which began in the following presents the pro forma impact of fin on our income had we adopted its provisions retroactively

such forward looking statements include  among others  statements regarding development and construction costs  lease expirations and extension of loan maturity dates 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in risk factors contained elsewhere in this report 
as more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we have restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements to correct our accounting treatment of certain items  including the methodology we used to determine our equity in joint venture earnings and the rates applied in our capitalized interest calculations 
all financial information contained herein has been revised to reflect the restatements 
overview we are a fully integrated  self managed real estate investment trust reit engaging in the ownership  development  redevelopment  leasing  acquisition  expansion and management of a portfolio of retail and entertainment oriented centers 
as of march   we owned or had an interest in properties  consisting of seventeen super regional mills landmark centers  twenty two regional st century retail and entertainment centers and two international retail and entertainment centers 
through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary  we provide development  management  leasing and financial services to entities owned by certain of our joint ventures 
executive summary we are engaged in the development  acquisition and operation of retail and entertainment real estate 
our primary source of revenue is tenant leases and therefore we endeavor to provide an environment where consumers are drawn to our properties providing tenants the ability to achieve success through high sales volumes 
properly defining the market area and its demographics  along with evaluating trends in where and how people shop  are key elements both in identifying properties for acquisition and sites which can be successfully developed 
in  we articulated a three prong strategy of expanding beyond our super regional mills landmark centers to encompass regional st century retail and entertainment centers and international retail and entertainment centers 
through december   this strategy has resulted in the acquisition of all  or a portion  of the ownership interests in nineteen st century retail and entertainment centers  two mills landmark centers and the opening of madrid xanad  our first international  ground up development 
at the same time  our historical development pipeline produced two additional mills landmark centers 
we anticipate continuing this strategy of expansion through property acquisition and ground up developments in the us and elsewhere 
operating results at our individual operating properties are impacted by the supply and demand for retail space  the strength or weakness of consumer demand and the financial health of retail tenants 
key measures used in evaluating the performance of our individual operating properties include in line tenant sales volume  in line tenant sales per square foot  average rents  re leasing spreads and occupancy rates  individual operating property performance is also monitored and evaluated using certain non gaap financial measures  specifically funds from operations ffo and net operating income noi 
ffo is a metric widely used in our industry and is used by us both as means to evaluate the performance of our properties and as one of several criteria to determine performance based bonuses 
noi affords us the opportunity to assess the results of an individual property before considering its unique capital structure and historical asset base 
ffo and noi are supplemental measures of operating performance and should not be considered as measures of liquidity  alternatives to net income or any other performance measure determined in accordance with gaap 
further  ffo and noi measures presented by us may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
we urge the users of our financial statements  including investors and potential investors in our securities  to carefully review the reconciliations of these measures to comparable gaap measures contained below 
interest rates are a critical factor in all facets of our business 
consistent with the real estate industry  we finance our projects with significant amounts of debt so fluctuations in interest rates could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using long term fixed rate or hedged to maturity debt on our stabilized properties and by hedging a portion of our floating rate construction debt 
in acquiring a property we evaluate the property s historical tenant sales levels  average rents and re leasing spreads 
our ability to finance the investment through debt and or the sale of partnership interests is also a factor 
additional considerations include expansion and or redevelopment opportunities afforded by the property and the potential to add value to the existing property by enhancing the tenant mix and or adding dining and entertainment options 
for foreign investments  we evaluate additional factors such as the ability to work with local partners and financiers  the stability of the local economy  costs associated with foreign taxes  currency hedging strategies  statutory requirements  and local customs 
operating portfolio data as noted above  we use a number of key measures to evaluate the performance of our individual operating properties 
we also use these measures in reviewing the performance of our combined portfolio of comparable properties 
comparable properties for this purpose are defined as stabilized wholly owned and or joint venture operating properties that we have owned and or that have been open for at least two years 
key measures for our comparable operating portfolio in relative to were as follows in line tenant sales increased in all categories gross sales per square foot rose to  same space sales rose and same center tenant sales per square foot rose to total average rent per square foot increased to average rent per square foot for in line tenants rose to while average rent per square foot for anchor tenants remained relatively constant increasing to 
re leasing spreads  excluding properties in the initial lease up period  rose for in line spaces and for same space anchors 
comparable occupancy rose to  an overall occupancy rate of was maintained in both periods despite redevelopment efforts at various centers 
comparable noi increased to million 
operating income increased to million 
the general improvement in our key operating metrics reflects a strengthening us economy in and the continuing achievements of our remerchandising efforts 
re leasing spreads illustrate that when leases terminate we are able to re lease the space to retailers at higher rents but even more importantly to tenants that may generate much higher sales volumes thereby attracting more consumers to our properties and benefiting all of the retailers at the property 
noi is a non gaap measure which we believe provides us the opportunity to better assess the results of our operating properties before considering each property s unique capital structure and historical asset base 
for our purposes  noi is comprised of property revenue minimum rent  percentage rent  recoveries from tenants and other property revenue less recoverable expenses and other operating expenses 
other operating expense includes bad debt expense but excludes interest expense  management fees and depreciation and amortization 
noi measures presented by us may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
operating income  a component of net income  is considered by management to be the most comparable gaap measure relative to noi 
reconciliations between operating income and noi follow in millions years ended december  restated restated consolidated operating income add deduct general and administrative cost of fees depreciation and amortization management and other fee income consolidated noi results of operations the comparability of our operating results over the past three years has been significantly impacted by changes in our consolidated property portfolio 
as discussed under liquidity and capital resources  during this three year period  we have acquired all or a portion of properties  we have sold or conveyed a portion of six properties  and we have opened or re opened four properties 
in addition  as described under critical accounting policies  on march   we adopted the provisions of fin which resulted in consolidating the results of operations of previously unconsolidated joint ventures effective april  our partners equity in the results of these consolidated joint ventures and the attribution to us  as primary beneficiary  of the elimination of interest and fees against the results of the consolidated joint ventures are classified as minority interest in consolidated joint ventures in our income statement 
in evaluating our results of operations on a consolidated basis  it is important to isolate the impact of properties opened  acquired and sold during either period 
in the following discussions we focus on our comparable operations which we define as properties that we have owned  that are stabilized  and which were open during the periods being compared 
compared to mills lp net income rose to million from million in the overall increase reflects gains on the sale or conveyance of joint venture interests million in versus million in  decreased interest expense due to the capitalization of interest related to joint ventures consolidated upon adoption of fin  and million of development fees and interest income related to our meadowlands xanadu development project 
these increases were partially offset by foreign currency exchange gains of million in compared to gains of million in other factors contributing to the change are discussed below 
tmc net income increased to million from million in reflecting the increase in mills lp net income and the impact of tmc s increased ownership of mills lp as compared to that as of december  tmc s ownership in mills lp increased to as of december  from at december  primarilly due to redemption of mills lp units 
portfolio results of operations the following reconciles portfolio operating results to our consolidated amounts 
our discussion and analysis focuses principally on comparable operating results which does not distinguish between wholly and partially owned properties 
non comparable includes the results of recently opened and or acquired properties 
comparable non comparable total less unconsolidated joint ventures consolidated minimum rent other revenue property revenue property operating costs net operating income mills proportionate share restated minimum rent other revenue property revenue property operating costs net operating income mills proportionate share included above as comparable are the results of joint venture operations that were consolidated under fin beginning april   and that were owned and whose properties were open and stabilized during the periods presented 
operating data for both comparable and non comparable joint ventures consolidated under the provisions of fin for the nine months ended december  was as follows in millions property revenue property operating costs depreciation and amortization expense interest expense other income  net net income comparable noi rose million or in compared to mainstreet  our pushcart operation  contributed over half of the overall increase in minimum rent while the remainder resulted principally from the increases noted in re leasing spreads and average rents discussed previously under operating portfolio 
the change in other revenue was primarily due to tenant lease buy out income 
corporate the following compares the components of our corporate operations in millions change restated management and other fee income cost of fee income general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization management and other fee income in does not include fees from joint ventures that have been consolidated since march  under the provisions of fin cost of fee income for includes the amounts that were previously netted against management and other fee income 
in  the associated revenues are classified both in management and other fee income and in the attribution to mills of the elimination of fees included in minority interest 
cost of fees represented approximately the same percentage of gross fee revenues in both years 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in which reflects the incremental costs and our ongoing efforts to recruit  retain and reward the human resources necessary to manage a larger and more complex portfolio as well as costs incurred in to implement the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and the impact of changes in our capitalization of costs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to non comparable operations  higher capital expenditures for space alterations for tenants whose leases commenced during or late in  and our new software systems which came on line july  other the following compares components of other income expense in to in millions change restated interest expense foreign currency exchange losses gains interest income other  net gain on sales of joint venture interests interest expense increased on a consolidated basis 
of this  million is attributable to the joint ventures consolidated upon the adoption of fin offset in part by additional capitalized interest relating to these joint ventures 
the remaining increase was due principally to higher average balances on our line of credit 
minority interest in consolidated joint ventures is the result of our consolidation of joint ventures pursuant to the provisions of fin the results of these joint venture operations are included in our consolidated results from april  equity in earnings of consolidated joint ventures represents our partners share in the results of these operations 
the elimination of intercompany interest and fees against the results of these operations is attributed to us  as primary beneficiary  and includes development fees of million and interest income of million 
foreign currency exchange gains result principally from re measuring our non us investment and advance balances which are denominated in local currencies into the us dollar for reporting purposes 
foreign currency exchange losses recorded during the first half of were recovered in the second half of as the us dollar weakened relative to the euro and canadian dollar 
interest income declined by since million is reflected as attribution to us of the elimination of interest and fees in whereas the comparable amount of million was reflected as interest income in additionally  there was a lower advance to madrid xanad in resulting in lower interest income 
these decreases were partially offset by million of income earned by our consolidated joint ventures during the last nine months of other  net increased million primarily due to additional land sale income of million  of which million relates to joint ventures consolidated upon the adoption of fin this increase was partially offset by additional abandoned project costs of million 
gain on sales of joint venture interests reflects gains on the sale or conveyance of joint venture interests in six properties during compared to one in as more fully described under liquidity and capital resources 
compared to results of operations in evaluating our results of operations on a consolidated basis from year to year  it is important to isolate the impact of properties opened  acquired or sold during either period 
since for our consolidated portfolio  over of the increase in each property related line item is related to the growth in the portfolio  our discussion will focus on the portion of the increase or decrease related to our stabilized properties that we have owned and or that have been open for at least two years comparable operations 
the acquisitions and developments are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources portion of this discussion 
the line items shown in the following tables are the items we think are important in understanding our operations and which had significant changes from year to year 
comparison of years ended december  and the following table reflects key items from our audited statements of income in millions change restated restated revenues property revenue management and other fee income total operating revenues operating expenses property operating expenses general and administrative expenses cost of fee income depreciation and amortization total operating expenses interest income interest expense  net foreign currency exchange gains  net income before minority interest in mills lp increased million or in primarily due to properties acquired in late and during  properties developed and placed in service in late and during and foreign currency exchange gains 
property revenue property revenue increased million or from to of the increase  or million  was contributed by our comparable operations and is attributable to a million increase in minimum rent 
nearly half of the increase in minimum rent was contributed by mainstreet  our push cart operation

partially offsetting these increases was an increase in capitalized interest 
gain on foreign currency transactions gain on foreign currency transactions increased million or from to the benefit results primarily from higher investment balances remeasured based on the weakening us dollar against the euro

funds from operations ffo ffo is a recognized metric by the real estate industry  in particular  reits 
accounting for real estate assets using historical cost accounting under gaap assumes that the value of such assets diminishes predictably over time 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit stated in its april white paper on funds from operations  since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  the concept of ffo was created by nareit 
as defined by nareit  ffo is net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
for management analysis purposes  we adjust the nareit defined ffo to exclude the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflected in net income arising primarily through the re measurement process of translating foreign investment and advance accounts for inclusion in our us dollar financial statements 
although we believe this adjustment presents ffo on a more comparable basis to ffo presented by other reits  it is important to realize that our ffo computation may be significantly different from that used by other reits and  accordingly  may  in fact  not be comparable 
tmc conducts all of its operations through mills lp 
in addition  if initiated by a holder of units of mills lp  the minority interest in mills lp is exchangeable in specified circumstances for either  in tmc s sole discretion  shares of its common stock on a one for one basis or the cash equivalent 
accordingly  we present ffo data for both tmc and mills lp 
management uses ffo to measure operating performance of our business and as one of several criteria to determine performance based bonuses 
we offer this measure to assist the users of our financial statements in analyzing our performance  however  this is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a measure of liquidity  an alternative to net income or an indicator of any other performance measure determined in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any gaap measure  including net income 
the following reconciles income from continuing operations  which is considered to be the most comparable gaap measure  to ffo 
we urge the users of our financial statements  including investors and potential investors in our securities  to carefully review the following reconciliation in millions 
years ended december  restated restated tmc income from continuing operations add deduct depreciation and amortization equity in depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures partners share of depreciation and amortization from consolidated joint ventures gain on sales of joint venture interests foreign currency exchange gains equity in foreign currency exchange gains from unconsolidated joint ventures mills lp common unit holders share of above adjustments tmc ffo add minority interest reflected as equity in mills lp mills lp ffo less preferred unit distributions ffo available to mills lp common unit holders liquidity and capital resources our consolidated cash flow was as follows in millions years ended december  restated restated net cash flows provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the year cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year our cash flow data for the fiscal years ended and is not wholly analogous due to our prospective adoption of fin  which resulted in the consolidation of the cash flows from previously unconsolidated joint ventures as of march  included in cash flows provided by investing activities for is million attributable to the cash balances of these joint ventures at march  distributions from our joint ventures are not subject to any significant restrictions but are governed by the underlying joint venture documents which specify how cash is distributed to each partner 
distributions to us from these joint ventures subsequent to march   amounted to million 
at december   our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million 
this amount includes million of consolidated joint venture cash balances 
cash and cash equivalents exclude restricted cash of million which is used to pay operating and capital expenditures of operating properties that serve as collateral for secured loan facilities 
in addition  at december   our unconsolidated joint ventures had combined cash and cash equivalents totaling million  excluding restricted cash balances of million 
our primary sources of short term liquidity are tenant leases that generate positive net cash flow from operations and cash distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures 
historically the net cash provided by operating activities and distributions from joint ventures have been sufficient to fund annual debt service payments  recurring capital expenditures and distributions to stock and unit holders 
we anticipate such funds will continue to be available to fund these payments 
we also have a billion unsecured line of credit  of which million was available at december  cash needed for acquisitions  development activities and major capital improvements are often funded initially by our line of credit facility 
initial funding of these capital investments has historically been repaid with the proceeds of construction loans  debt refinancing  common and or preferred equity issuances and proceeds from the sale of partnership interests 
since december   we have made additional draws on our line of credit aggregating million 
our ability to draw on our line of credit is subject to the maintenance of the financial ratios specified in the line of credit agreement 
while we believe we will be able to maintain a capital structure that will enable us to have access to the line of credit  it is possible that certain of the financial ratios could constrain our ability to access the entire committed amount 
the following ratios are used by us as indicators of our overall liquidity and  as such  are computed based on our proportionate share of both consolidated and unconsolidated operations and debt years ended december  restated restated coverage ratios interest coverage ratio fixed charge ratio leverage ratio debt to market capitalization ratio debt indicators weighted average maturity in years weighted average interest rate fixed rate debt percentage fixed rate debt percentage  including swaps in place through december   and  respectively financing activities we use various financing vehicles to fund capital investments including construction loans  debt refinancing and common and or preferred equity issuances 
proceeds from the sale or conveyance of partnership interests are also available to supplement this funding 
over the last three years  we and our joint ventures have completed several such transactions 
in february  the pittsburgh mills joint venture secured a construction loan with a total commitment of million 
the interest only loan matures in february and provides for two one year extensions 
the loan is fully guaranteed by us and has an interest rate of libor plus 
the libor margin and our guaranty are reduced as certain performance measures are achieved 
the following sections provide greater detail of the debt and equity transactions completed by us and our joint ventures during debt transactions line of credit 
in december  we refinanced our existing million unsecured line of credit and million secured term loan with an unsecured billion credit facility the facility which includes a revolving credit commitment of billion and a term loan of million 
borrowings under the facility may be used to acquire or develop real property  make various permitted investments  repay indebtedness and fund other working capital needs 
at our option  borrowings under the facility bear interest at libor or a base rate plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio 
the margin on libor rate loans varies between and and between and on base rate loans 
we also pay a facility fee  based on our leverage ratio and ranging from to basis points on the aggregate loans and unused commitments 
at december  the weighted average interest rate on the aggregate outstanding borrowings was 
the facility is scheduled to expire in december and contains a one year extension option 
the various covenants in the facility are generally consistent with the types of covenants that were applicable under our previous revolving credit and term loan agreements prior to amendment and restatement 
these operational restrictions include  among other things  customary restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness or grant liens  pay dividends or make stock repurchases  make investments  acquire businesses or assets or enter into joint ventures  make expenditures on construction assets that are not leased  engage in business other than those that acquire  develop  lease  re develop or manage retail real property and business incidental thereto  enter into transactions with partners and affiliates  and merge  consolidate or dispose of assets 
we are also required to comply with various ongoing financial covenants  including with respect to maximum leverage and secured leverage ratios  minimum combined equity value determined according to the difference between our capitalization value and our outstanding indebtedness  and minimum interest coverage ratio 
if we do not comply with the various financial and other covenants and requirements in the facility  the lenders may  subject to various customary cure rights  require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the facility 
on february   we entered into a waiver agreement with respect to our facility 
the waiver agreement waives any potential event of default or event of default under the facility that we expect would have been caused by our restatement of financial results 
as a result of the restatement  among other things  we would no longer be able to make the representations under the facility concerning the conformity with gaap of our previously delivered financial statements  or confirm our prior compliance with certain obligations concerning the maintenance of our books and records in accordance with gaap 
because the restatement was not expected to result in our having breached any of the financial covenants in the facility  the waiver agreement did not waive or modify any such financial covenants 
contemporaneously with the filing of this form k  we satisfied all conditions contained in the waiver agreement  and therefore the facility continues to remain available and in full force and effect

lauderdale  fl

future capital requirements we anticipate that future expenditures including operating expenses  interest expenses and recurring principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  recurring capital expenditures  dividends to stockholders in accordance with reit requirements and distributions to common unitholders  will be provided by cash generated from operations and potential peripheral land sales 
we anticipate that future development and non recurring capital expenditures will be funded from cash from operations  proceeds from land sales  future borrowings  joint venture equity contributions and proceeds from issuances of preferred and or common equity 
access to such future capital is dependent on many factors outside of our control 
we believe that we will have access to additional capital resources sufficient to expand and develop our business and to complete the projects currently under development 
if we cannot raise the necessary capital  our immediate and long term development plans could be curtailed 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   our material off balance sheet commitments were as follows we had provided letters of credit totaling million  of which million relates to meadowlands xanadu  million relates to pittsburgh mills and million relates to vaughan mills 
as of december  no amounts had been drawn on the letters 
we had guaranteed million of our unconsolidated joint venture debt  which will be reduced as certain performance criteria are met 
we generally guaranty our share of any construction loan and our joint venture partners share of the construction loan until permanent financing is obtained 
we generally guarantee a preferred return on kanam s equity balance in our consolidated joint ventures until permanent financing is obtained 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes projected payments due under our contractual obligations  in millions  as of december  total less than one year one to three years three to five years over five years debt obligations capital lease obligation operating lease obligations capital expenditure commitments includes the meadowlands xanadu ground lease obligation 
a substantial portion of our capital expenditures is expected to be financed by construction loans 
the table below summarizes our proportionate share of projected payments due under the contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures  in millions  as of december  total less than one year one to three years three to five years over five years debt obligations total amount guaranteed by us capital lease obligation capital expenditure commitments critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
the following briefly describes those accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our business and the preceding discussion and analysis consolidation 
we consolidate the accounts of tmc  mills lp and all subsidiaries that we control 
we do not consider ourselves to be in control of an entity when major business decisions require the approval of at least one other partner 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
we also consolidate entities that are considered to be variable interest entities vie s under the provisions of fin and for which we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary 
the determination of whether an entity is a vie requires an in depth knowledge of the structure of the economics and governance of the entity  and judgment is necessary in how this knowledge is applied to the rules described by fin at march  the results of applying this judgment to our situation was to consolidate joint ventures with total assets of  million and total liabilities of  million 
the effects of the elimination of interest and fees revenue and expense due to intercompany transactions with consolidated joint ventures are attributable to us as primary beneficiary 
revenue recognition 
minimum rent from income producing properties is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases and includes amortization of deferred revenue resulting from acquired leases and the amortization of lease inducements 
judgment is required to determine when a tenant takes control of the space  and accordingly when to commence the recognition of rent 
as a part of the restatement of our financial statements  we revised our previous practice of recognizing rent beginning with the lease commencement date to recognizing income from the date the tenant has control of the space 
the impact of this on retained earnings was million and it had an immaterial impact on net income for the periods presented 
percentage rent is recognized when tenants sales have reached certain sales levels as specified in the underlying lease 
recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
reit status 
in order to maintain our status as a reit  we are required to distribute of our taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests in addition to other requirements 
we monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact our reit status 
if we fail to meet our reit status we would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate rates for a period of four additional years before we could reapply for reit status 
acquisition of income producing real estate 
the cost of acquired income producing property represents the allocation of purchase price to such assets based on appraisals and other valuation methods used in accounting for the acquisition and includes  if material  an allocation to identifiable intangible assets such as above below market leases and at market leases in place at date of acquisition based on their fair values 
external costs directly related to acquisition opportunities we are actively pursuing are capitalized 
if we are successful in completing the acquisition  such costs are allocated to the acquired property as part of the purchase price 
if not  such costs are expensed in the period it becomes likely the acquisition will not be completed 
income producing properties are individually evaluated for impairment when various conditions exist that may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows from a property is less than its historical net cost basis 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of historical cost basis over fair value 
in addition  we write off costs related to predevelopment projects when we determine it is no longer probable that we will develop the project 
determining the fair value of an asset  and accordingly the impairment change  if any  to record  requires making judgmental estimates of the future cash flows and operations of the item  together with the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
equity method 
equity in the income or loss of joint ventures is recorded on the equity method of accounting 
we allocate income to equity participants based on the terms of the respective partnership agreements upon an assumed liquidation of the joint venture at its depreciated book value as of the end of the reporting period 
this requires an in depth understanding of our joint ventures  many of which are complex 
it is necessary to understand the implications of particular transactions during the year on the calculations 
foreign currency translation 
the functional currency for entities operating or projects in development outside the united states is the currency of the country in which the entity or project is located 
the financial statements of such entities are translated from the functional currency into us dollars for inclusion in our financial statements 
in addition  our foreign investment and related advances are denominated in the foreign entity s functional currency and re measured to our functional currency of the us dollar 
we expect to settle these amounts in the foreseeable future through distributions from the foreign entity 
accordingly  gains or losses resulting from the re measurement are included in the determination of net income 
capitalization of development and leasing costs 
we capitalize the costs of development and leasing activities of our properties 
these costs are incurred both at the property location and at the regional and corporate office level 
the amount of capitalization depends  in part  on the identification and justifiable allocation of certain activities to specific projects and leases 
differences in methodologies of cost identification and documentation  as well as differing assumptions as to the time incurred on projects  can yield significant differences in the amounts capitalized 
capitalization of interest 
interest is capitalized on real estate and development assets  including investments in joint ventures  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 capitalization of interest cost  and sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost in financial statements that include investments accounted for by the equity method 
the capitalization period commences when development begins and continues until the asset is ready for its intended use or is abandoned 
the calculation includes interest costs that theoretically could have been avoided  based first on project specific borrowings then on an assumed repayment of our highest rate debt  had the underlying development and construction activities not been undertaken 
judgment is necessary to determine specifically when to commence and to cease capitalization  particularly in situations involving our redevelopment projects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we and our joint ventures are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
to limit this exposure  we follow established risk management policies and procedures including the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
derivative instruments used for hedging must be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure 
changes in the hedging instrument s fair value related to the effective portion of the risk being hedged are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs 
hedges that meet these criteria are formally designated as cash flow hedges at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is marked to market with the change included in net income in each period until the derivative instrument matures 
any derivative instrument used for risk management that becomes ineffective is marked to market through earnings 
depending on the underlying exposure  interest rate swaps  caps and floors  options  forwards or a combination thereof  may be used to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps and collars are contractual agreements with third parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments periodically without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts notional amounts 
in the unlikely event that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of an interest rate swap contract or collar agreement  the exposure is limited to the interest rate differential on the notional amount 
we do not anticipate non performance by any of our counterparties 
net interest differentials to be paid or received under a swap contract and or collar agreement are accrued as interest expense as incurred or earned 
interest rate hedges  designated as cash flow hedges  hedge the future cash outflows on debt 
interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments  interest rate caps  floors  collars and forwards are cash flow hedges 
the unrealized gains or losses in the fair value of these hedges are reported on the balance sheet and included in accounts payable and other liabilities or in investment in unconsolidated joint ventures with a corresponding adjustment to either accumulated other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the hedging relationship 
if the hedging transaction is a cash flow hedge  then the offsetting gains losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent of the effective portion of the risk being hedged 
some derivative instruments are associated with the hedge of an anticipated transaction 
over time  the unrealized gains losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be reclassified to earnings consistent with when the hedged items are recognized in earnings 
this type of reclassification reduced net income by million for the year ended december  as of december   we and our joint ventures were party to interest rate swap agreements that hedge the impact of the variability of libor on cash outflows 
under the agreements  we  or the joint venture  receive libor and pay a fixed rate 
the following summarizes the current and deferred start swap terms of the derivative instruments and provides a reconciliation of their fair values and adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss wholly owned joint ventures hedge type cash flow cash flow description swap swap range of notional amounts millio n million range of interest rates range of deferred effective start dates range of maturity dates accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  change in other comprehensive loss accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  the following disclosures of estimated fair value of financial instruments were determined by management  using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies based on pertinent information available to management at december  and considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could realize on disposition of the financial instruments 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the reasonable fair value amounts  such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these consolidated financial statements since december   and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein 
the following table  in millions of dollars  presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates  including the effect of interest rate swaps currently in effect  for our consolidated mortgages  notes and loans payable that may be sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate thereafter total estimated fair value at december  at december  we had fixed rate debt aggregating  million with an estimated fair value of  million and variable rate debt totaling million which approximated its fair value 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign joint venture investments and advance balances that are denominated in foreign currencies and thus require re measurement into the us dollar 
the exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to translating the income and expenses of our equity investments is minimal due to the fact that most transactions occur in the functional currency of that entity 
we currently have not hedged the foreign joint venture investments and advance balances 
based on our investments and advances at december   a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in an approximate impact of million to income before minority interest
