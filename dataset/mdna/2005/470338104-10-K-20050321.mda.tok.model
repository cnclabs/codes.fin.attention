item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis and other portions of this report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including statements of goals  intentions  and expectations as to future trends  plans  events or results of company operations and policies and regarding general economic conditions 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by use of such words as may  will  anticipate  believes  expects  plans  estimates  potential  continue  should  and similar words or phases 
these statements are based upon current and anticipated economic conditions  nationally and in the company s market  interest rates and interest rate policies  competitive factors  government agencies and other third parties  which by their nature are not susceptible to accurate forecast  and are subject to significant uncertainty 
because of these uncertainties and the assumptions on which this discussion and the forward looking statements are based  actual future operations and results in the future may differ materially from those indicated herein 
readers are cautioned against placing undue reliance on any such forward looking statement 
introduction this management s discussion and analysis reviews the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended december   and some tables cover more than these periods to comply with securities and exchange commission disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends over a period of time 
when reading this discussion  reference should be made to the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear herein and to our consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year ended december  critical accounting policies there were no changes to the company s critical accounting policies in the fourth quarter of critical accounting policies are those applications of accounting principles or practices that require considerable judgment  estimation  or sensitivity analysis by management 
in the financial service industry  examples  albeit not an all inclusive list  of disclosures that may fall within this definition are the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of mortgage servicing rights  valuation of derivatives or securities without a readily determinable market value  and the valuation of the fair value of intangibles and goodwill 
except for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the company does not believe there are other practices or policies that require significant sensitivity analysis  judgments  or estimations 
allowance for loan losses 
the company has developed a methodology to determine  on a quarterly basis  an allowance to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans  historical loss experience  peer bank loss experience  delinquency trends  economic conditions  portfolio composition  and specific loss estimates for loans considered substandard or doubtful 
all commercial and commercial real estate loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
if necessary  reserves would be allocated to individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow 
any reserves for impaired loans are measured based on the present rate or fair value of the underlying collateral 
the company evaluates the collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
a composite allowance factor that considers the company s and other peer bank loss experience ratios  delinquency trends  economic conditions  and portfolio composition are applied to the total of commercial and commercial real estate loans not specifically evaluated 
a percentage of this composite allowance factor is also applied to the aggregate of unused commercial lines of credit which the company has an obligation to honor but where the borrower has not elected to draw on their lines of credit 
homogeneous loans  such as consumer installment  residential mortgage loans  home equity loans  and smaller consumer loans are not individually risk graded 
reserves are established for each homogeneous pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs from a current trend in delinquencies  losses or historical experience and general economic conditions 
the company has no material delinquencies in these types of loans  and has not  since inception  had a trend or an indication of a trend that would guide the company in expected material losses in these types of homogeneous pools of loans 
the company s allowance for loan losses is determined based upon a methodology developed by management as described above and is approved by the board of directors each quarter 
company highlights since december  are o average assets grew million 
o average loans grew million 
o average deposits grew million 
o net interest margin was for the full year compared to for the full year o asset quality remained strong as nonperforming assets decreased thousand to thousand 
the allowance for loan losses totaled of total loans outstanding at december  o the company ended the year with excellent liquidity and adequate capital to support further growth 
o the company opened a sixth banking office in chantilly  virginia on july  in addition to the branch site  the company leased  square feet of space on the second floor of the branch building to accommodate expanding administrative  operational support and mortgage services departments 
the move into the new operations space was accomplished on july  enabling the bank to maintain its focus on excellent customer service while continuing to grow at a rapid rate 
o the company opened a seventh banking office in manassas  virginia on september  the bank has hired three lenders who have spent a significant part of their banking careers working in the manassas market 
o the company s expansion into the chantilly and manassas markets  along with the opening of the new operations center  are growth oriented initiatives taken after additional capital was raised in the fourth quarter of while these pro active initiatives have increased operating expenses  as evidenced by the rise in the bank s efficiency ratio to for the full year  the company s focus remains on a long term strategy of expanding our franchise throughout the northern virginia market 
o the company effected a three for two stock split for shareholders of record on may   paid on june  balance sheet year ended december  vs 
year ended december  total assets increased by million from december  to december   ending the period at million 
during this period  the company emphasized the importance of becoming the primary banker for our customers with the goal of providing both lending and deposit services 
these efforts resulted in deposit growth of million and loan growth of million 
the securities portfolio grew during the year by million  ending the period at million 
the company s liquidity position improved by million as overnight investments totaled million at year end 
stockholders equity increased million as a result of the million of earnings retention for the year  and  in proceeds from the issuance of shares upon the exercise of options and the sale of shares in the company s ksop plan  offset by a  decrease in the unrealized gains on securities available for sale 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  total assets increased by million from december  to december   ending the period at million 
the increase in assets was funded by deposit growth of million  issuance of common stock of million  million in proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred capital notes and million in short term borrowings 
these funding mechanisms enabled the company to fund an increase in loans of million and the addition of million to the securities portfolio 
to minimize exposure to historically low short term interest rates the company became a net purchaser of overnight funds during the fourth quarter of stockholders equity increased million as a result of the million of earnings retention for the year  the million  net of commissions and expenses  from the sale of common stock in the public offering  and  from the exercise of options and sale of shares in the company s ksop plan  offset by a million decrease in the unrealized gains on securities available for sale 
results of operations for the year ended december   the company earned million  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share  compared with million  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share  for the year ended december  and million  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share  for the year ended december  the comparable earnings per share are impacted by the  shares issued in november  coupled with the for stock split this year  resulting in approximately  more shares outstanding in computing earnings per share 
return on average assets was 
and return on average equity was for the year ended december  compared to a 
return on average assets and return on average equity for the year ended december  and a 
return on average assets and a return on average equity for the year ended december during  the company continued to focus on managing its net interest margin  especially in light of the low interest rate environment 
beginning in through june  the federal reserve reduced the federal funds target rate an aggregate of basis points 
these dramatic reductions over a relatively short period continued to impact the loan and investment portfolios in and  as loans repriced on a delayed basis or renewed at lower interest rates  and as investment securities matured or were called  and were reinvested at lower rates 
this was partially offset by continued repricing upon renewal of certificates of deposit 
while the federal reserve began to reverse the rate reductions  through a series of five increases aggregating basis points  beginning on june   and continuing in august  september  november and december  the rate reductions and continuing low rate environment has resulted in a reduction in the net interest margin throughout the period  from in to in to in to in to in despite these reductions  the company s practice of managing its interest rate risk process has mitigated the negative effect of such a severely declining and low rate environment 
the company expects that continued increases in the federal funds target rate will contribute to an increased margin as earning assets reprice  while repricing of deposits lags 
however  as discussed further under liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management  as a result of competitive factors  market conditions  customer preferences and other factors  the company may not be able to benefit from further increases in market interest rates 
although the company has continued to grow in asset size since its inception in it has been able to control its operating efficiency 
during the third and fourth quarters of the company expanded into the chantilly and manassas markets and opened a new operations center 
these are growth oriented initiatives taken after additional capital was raised in the fourth quarter of while these pro active initiatives have increased operating expenses  as evidenced by the rise in the efficiency ratio to for the year as compared to in  the company s focus remains on a long term strategy of expanding our franchise throughout the northern virginia market 
the efficiency ratio is a non gaap financial measure  which we believe provides investors with important information regarding our operational efficiency 
we compute our efficiency ratio by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income  which includes securities gains or losses and gains or losses on the sale of mortgage loans 
comparison of our efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible  because other companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently 
net interest income  average balances and yields net interest income is the difference between interest and fees earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is one of the major determining factors in the bank s performance as it is the principal source of revenue and earnings 
unlike the larger regional or mega banks that have significant sources of fee income  community banks  such as james monroe bank  rely on net interest income from traditional banking activities as the primary revenue source 
table provides certain information relating to the company s average consolidated statements of financial condition and reflects the interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense of interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december   and and the average yields earned and rates paid during those periods 
these yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average daily balance of the related asset or liability for the periods presented 
the company did not have any tax exempt income during any of the periods presented in table nonaccrual loans have been included in the average balances of loans receivable

as the table shows  the increase in net interest income of million for the year ended december   as compared to the twelve months ended december   is due to the growth in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
while the decrease in interest rates has  to date  affected total interest income  and to a lesser extent  total interest expense  management has controlled its exposure to changes in interest rates such that the negative effect of the decline in interest rates and the decline in loan yields  as adjustable rate loans have repriced downward over the past several years  resulted in a modest  reduction of net interest income  whereas the growth in earning assets and deposits resulted in an increase of million to net interest income 
interest income over the past year increased million 
as shown in the table  million of this increase is the result of the company s strong growth in earning assets  particularly in loans  while changes in rates resulted in a  reduction in interest income 
interest expense during this comparable period increased million or  from million in interest expense in to million in interest expense in of this increase  million is due to growth in interest bearing liabilities  and  is attributable to declining rates 
similar to changes in  the increase in net interest income of million for the year ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  is due to the growth in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
of this increase  million is attributable to strong growth in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  whereas  declining rates resulted in a  reduction in net interest income 
interest income increased million from million in to million in of this increase  million is the result of growth in earning assets whereas million is attributable to declining interest rates 
interest expense was virtually the same in as in at million  however  increased balances of million resulted in an increase in interest expense of million while at the same time management of interest rates paid on these liabilities reduced interest expense by a similar amount

a potential loss factor is applied to these loans which considers the historical charge off history of the company and its peer group  trends in delinquencies and loan grading  current economic conditions  and factors that include the composition of the company s loan portfolio 
at december   the company had impaired loans on nonaccrual status totaling  the company had no other loans over days past due and had no other loans on nonaccrual status as of december  the provision for loan losses increased primarily due to reserves required on new loans

lending activity is largely confined to our market of northern virginia 
we do not engage in highly leveraged transactions or foreign lending activities 
loans in the commercial category  as well as commercial real estate mortgages  consist primarily of short term five year or less final maturity and or floating or adjustable rate commercial loans made to small to medium sized companies 
we do not have any agricultural loans in the portfolio 
there are no substantial loan concentrations to any one industry or to any one borrower 
virtually all of the company s commercial real estate mortgage and development loans  which account for approximately of our total loans at december   relate to property in the northern virginia market 
as such  they are subject to risks relating to the general economic conditions in that market  and the market for real estate in particular 
while the region has experienced some decline in economic activity during and  the local real estate market remains generally strong  and the company attempts to mitigate risk though careful underwriting  including primary reliance on the borrower s financial capacity and ability to repay without resort to the property  and lends primarily with respect to properties occupied or managed by the owner 
the company s family residential real estate loans are generally not the typical purchase money first mortgage loan or refinancing  but are loans made for other purposes and the collateral obtained is a first deed of trust on the residential property of the borrower 
the underlying loan would have a final maturity much shorter than the typical first mortgage and may be a variable or fixed rate loan 
as reflected in table  of the company s loans are fixed rate loans and of the company s loans reprice or have a maturity date that falls within five years 
consumer loans consist primarily of secured installment credits to individuals  residential construction loans secured by a first deed of trust  home equity loans  or home improvement loans

increases in the portfolio have occurred whenever deposit growth has outpaced loan demand and the forecast for loan growth is such that the investment of excess liquidity in investment securities as opposed to short term investments such as federal funds is warranted 
in general  our investment philosophy is to acquire high quality government agency securities or high grade corporate bonds  with a maturity of five to six years or less in the case of fixed rate securities 
in the case of mortgage backed securities  the policy is to invest only in those securities whose average expected life is projected to be approximately five to six years or less 
mortgage backed securities with a maturity of ten years or more are either adjustable rate securities or the expected life of the mortgage pool is generally no more than five or six years 
to the extent possible  we attempt to ladder the one time call dates for all our securities 
the company s investment policy is driven by its interest rate risk process and the need to minimize the effect of changing interest rates to the entire balance sheet

off balance sheet arrangements credit related financial instruments 
the company is a party to credit related financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit 
such commitments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in consolidated balance sheets 
the company s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments 
the company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
at december  and  the following financial instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit   stand by letters of credit   commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitments amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by the company  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit  revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
these lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually do not contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the company is committed 
commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements 
essentially all letters of credit issued have expiration dates within one year 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the company generally holds collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary 
with the exception of these off balance sheet arrangements  and the company s obligations in connection with its trust preferred securities  the company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources  that is material to investors

the company also had million of time deposits  exclusive of interest  the maturity distribution of which is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements

liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management the primary objectives of asset and liability management are to provide for the safety of depositor and investor funds  assure adequate liquidity  and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers  who may be depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
we define liquidity for these purposes as the ability to raise cash quickly at a reasonable cost without principal loss 
the primary liquidity measurement we utilize is called the basic surplus  which captures the adequacy of our access to reliable sources of cash relative to the stability of our funding mix of deposits 
accordingly  we have established borrowing facilities with other banks federal funds and the federal home loan bank as sources of liquidity in addition to the deposits 
the basic surplus approach enables us to adequately manage liquidity from both tactical and contingency perspectives 
at december   our basic surplus ratio net access to cash and secured borrowings as a percentage of total assets was approximately compared to the present internal minimum guideline range of to 
financial institutions utilize a number of methods to evaluate interest rate risk 
methods range from the original static gap analysis the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  measured at a specific point in time  to running multiple simulations of potential interest rate scenarios  to rate shock analysis  to highly complicated duration analysis 
one tool that we utilize in managing our interest rate risk is the matched funding matrix 
the matrix arrays repricing opportunities along a time line for both assets and liabilities 
the longer term  more fixed rate sources are presented in the upper left hand corner while the shorter term  more variable rate items  are at the lower left 
similarly  uses of funds  such as assets  are arranged across the top moving from left to right 
the body of the matrix is derived by allocating the longest fixed rate funding sources to the longest fixed rate assets and shorter term variable sources to shorter term variable uses 
the result is a graphical depiction of the time periods over which we expect to experience exposure to rising or falling rates 
since the scales of the liability and assets sides are identical  all numbers in the matrix would fall within the diagonal lines if we were perfectly matched across all repricing time frames 
numbers outside the diagonal lines represent two general types of mismatches liability sensitive in time frames when numbers are to the left of the diagonal line and asset sensitive in time frames when numbers are to the right of the diagonal line 
at december   we were modestly liability sensitive in the short term and then we become asset sensitive out beyond two years 
this is primarily caused by the assumptions used in allocating a repricing term to nonmaturity deposits demand deposits  savings accounts  and money market deposit accounts 
the actual impact due to changes in interest rates is difficult to quantify in that the administrative ability to change rates on these products is influenced by competitive market conditions in changing rate environments  prepayments of loans  customer demands  and many other factors 
these products may not reprice consistently with assets such as variable rate commercial loans or other loans that immediately reprice as the prime rate changes 
while the traditional gap analysis and the matched funding matrix show a general picture of our potential sensitivity to changes in interest rates  it cannot quantify the actual impact of interest rate changes 
thus  the company manages its exposure to possible changes in interest rates by simulation modeling or what if scenarios to quantify the potential financial implications of changes in interest rates 
in practice  each quarter approximately different what if scenarios are evaluated which include the following scenarios static rates  most likely rate projection  rising rate environment  declining rate environment  ramp up bp and bp over months  and ramp down bp and bp over months scenarios 
in addition  rate shock scenarios are modeled at bp up and bp down increments but not below zero 
at december   the following month impact on net interest income is estimated to range from a positive impact of in a rising rate scenario  to a negative impact of if rates decline basis points from current levels 
the company believes these ranges of exposure to changes in interest rates to be well within acceptable range given a wide variety of potential rate change scenarios 
this process is performed each quarter to ensure the company is not materially at risk to possible changes in interest rates 
the following are the projected potential percentage impact on the company s net interest income over the next months for the most likely to occur scenarios  but measured against a static interest rate environment as of december  the company is positioned to improve earnings if rates continue to rise 
with respect to further reductions in rates  the company would experience further negative implications on margins and earnings  however  the company does not believe that a basis point decline is realistic given that interest rates remain near historically low levels  and in light of the federal reserve s indications with respect to the interest rate environment 
thus management believes the exposure to further changes in interest rates would not have a material negative effect on the results of operations

to date  the company has not been required to pay any premiums for deposit insurance 
to the extent that deposit premiums may become required  the company s results of operations will be adversely affected 
table the categories of noninterest income that exceed of operating revenue are as follows december  dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts cash management fee income gain on sale of securities gain on sale of mortgages other fee income total noninterest income   the increases in noninterest income for the each period shown are the result of the continued growth of the company and the expansion of products resulting in fee income
