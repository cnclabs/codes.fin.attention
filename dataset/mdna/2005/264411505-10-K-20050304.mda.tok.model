business overview we are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust that began operations through a related entity in as of december   we owned or jointly controlled industrial  office and retail properties including properties under development  consisting of over million square feet primarily located in states  and owned or jointly controlled more than  acres of land with an estimated future development potential of more than million square feet of industrial  office and retail properties 
we provide the following services for our properties and for certain properties owned by third parties property leasing  property management  construction  development  and other tenant related services 
management philosophy and priorities our key business and financial strategies for the future include the following our business objective is to increase funds from operations ffo by i maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing properties  ii expanding existing properties in our existing markets and by entering new markets  iii developing and acquiring new properties for rental operations in our existing markets  iv using our construction expertise to act as a general contractor in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis  v developing properties in our existing markets and other markets which we will sell through our merchant building development program and vi providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties 
see the year in review section below for further explanation and definition of ffo 
we intend to continue our capital recycling program whereby we pursue opportunities to dispose of investment properties and land held for development that no longer meet our long term growth strategies 
we intend to recycle the capital from these transactions to retire outstanding debt and invest in properties with better long term return potential for us 
our financing strategy is to actively manage the components of our capital structure including common and preferred equity and debt to maintain a conservatively leveraged balance sheet and investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies 
this strategy provides us with the financial flexibility to fund both development and acquisition opportunities 
we seek to maintain a well balanced  conservative and flexible capital structure by i extending and sequencing the maturity dates of debt  ii borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than  iii pursuing current and future long term debt financings and refinancing on an unsecured basis  iv maintaining conservative debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios  and v issuing attractively priced perpetual preferred stock for of our total capital structure 
year in review year presented a combination of economic and market challenges affecting the broader real estate industry as well as our company 
in the face of these challenges  we achieved steady operating results while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
net income available for common shareholders for the year ended december  was million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted for the year ended the decrease is primarily attributable to a significant increase in depreciation expense resulting from significant capital expenditures during and related to re leasing existing space and the effects of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas in recording acquisitions  particularly the recognition of short lived in place lease intangible assets 
see further discussion of this policy under the critical accounting polices section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
through increased leasing activity  we achieved a growth in rental revenues in over as our in service portfolio year end occupancy increased from in to at the end of we also experienced an increase in our development and construction of new properties for both owned investments and third party construction projects in as compared to as an important performance metric for us as a real estate company  ffo available to common shareholders increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in  or ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust reit 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  improves the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and makes comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management considers ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  ffo assists in comparing the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
the following table summarizes the calculation of ffo for the years ended december in thousands net income available for common shares add back deduct depreciation and amortization share of adjustments for unconsolidated companies earnings from depreciated property sales minority interest share of add backs funds from operations throughout  we continued to maintain a conservative balance sheet and investment grade debt ratings from moody s baa  standard poors bbb and fitch bbb 
our debt to total market capitalization ratio total market capitalization is defined as the total market value of all outstanding common and preferred shares and units of limited partner interest in our operating partnership plus outstanding indebtedness of at december  compared to at december  continues to provide us financial flexibility to fund new investments 
highlights of our debt financing activity in are as follows in january  we issued million of unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of  due in february  we renewed our million unsecured credit facility and in the process reduced the stated interest rate by basis points to libor basis points and extended the maturity to in august  we issued million of unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of  due a portion of the proceeds was used to retire million of existing debt that had a blended effective interest rate of 
in december  we issued million of floating rate unsecured debt at basis points over libor 
the debt matures in  but is callable at our option after six months 
we issued preferred stock during allowing us to redeem existing higher rate preferred stock and continue to utilize preferred stock as a key component of our capital structure 
highlights of preferred stock transactions in are as follows in february  we issued million of series k preferred stock at a dividend rate of 
this issuance was in conjunction with the redemption of our million series e preferred stock in january  which had a dividend rate of 
although the redemption resulted in certain non cash charges that were dilutive to earnings in  the lower dividend rate will reduce our future cost of capital 
in march  we called for the redemption of our series d convertible preferred stock 
prior to the redemption  nearly all outstanding preferred d shares were converted into common shares 
the series d shares carried a dividend rate of 
in november  we issued million of series l preferred stock at a dividend rate of 
in addition to steady operating performance and prudent balance sheet management during  we continued to effectively execute our capital recycling program and began several key initiatives and projects to leverage our development and construction capabilities as follows we disposed of nearly million of older  non strategic properties and used the proceeds to help fund over million of acquisitions 
the acquisitions were predominantly suburban office properties totaling million square feet with an expected return of 
we increased our investment in undeveloped land to provide greater opportunities to use our development and construction expertise in the improving economic cycle 
the new land positions included the exercise of purchase options to acquire million of land in our newly announced  acre  multi year anson mixed use development project in suburban indianapolis 
additionally  we acquired over million of land to develop a suburban office park with retail amenities in a vibrant north dallas suburb  thus allowing us to enter the dallas suburban office market and leverage our development and construction plan 
we formed our national development and construction group in to pursue opportunities with companies that have a national presence and seek to expand in multiple locations  including those outside our core markets 
this group combines our multiple disciplines including property development  legal and construction management to provide a range of development options for customers 
also  saw the creation of a strategic agreement with a developer of medical office and healthcare related facilities to jointly develop and sell medical facilities throughout the united states 
our partner will develop  lease and manage the facilities while we provide construction financing and general contractor services 
we will share in the profits upon sale of the projects 
this initiative allows us to further leverage our construction capabilities in a significantly growing industry 
finally  we will continue to develop long term investment assets to be held in our portfolio  develop assets to be sold upon completion and perform third party construction projects 
with over million in our development pipeline at december   we are encouraged about the long term growth opportunities in our business 
key performance indicators our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our office  industrial and retail properties rental operations 
the following highlights the areas of rental operations that we consider critical for future revenue growth all square footage totals and occupancy percentages reflect both wholly owned properties and properties in joint ventures occupancy analysis as discussed above  the ability to maintain occupancy rates is a principal driver of our results of operations 
the following table sets forth occupancy information regarding our in service portfolio of rental properties as of december  and in thousands  except percent occupied total square feet percent of total square feet percent occupied type industrial service centers bulk office retail total we experienced occupancy improvement in our industrial bulk and office properties during as business fundamentals improved moderately during the year 
lease expiration and renewals our ability to maintain and grow occupancy rates primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re lease expiring space 
the following table reflects our in service lease expiration schedule as of december   by product type 
the table indicates square footage and annualized net effective rents based on december rental revenue under expiring leases in thousands total portfolio industrial office retail year of expiration square feet dollars square feet dollars square feet dollars square feet dollars and thereafter total portfolio square feet percent occupied we renewed and of our leases up for renewal totaling approximately million and million square feet on which we attained a and a growth in net effective rents in and  respectively 
the relatively flat growth in rental rates is indicative of excess vacancies in many of our markets requiring competitive pricing strategies to retain current tenants 
our lease renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively consistent at a success rate despite the relatively weak market conditions 
we do not expect this renewal percentage in to differ from that experienced in the average term of renewals increased to years in from years in the increase in the average term is due to competitive market conditions with tenants seeking longer leases at attractive rates 
future development another source of growth in earnings is the development of additional rental properties 
these properties should provide future earnings through service operations income upon sale or from rental operations growth as they are placed in service 
we had million square feet of property under development with total project costs of million at december   compared to million square feet and total project costs of million at december  the increase in volume is attributable to a general increase in leasing activity and speculative and preleased developments in in  we specifically limited the development of speculative properties due to the weakened economy 
our speculative development levels are still below historical levels  however  as certain sectors of the economy begin to improve  our level of speculative development may increase

through this program  we are continually improving the overall quality of our investment portfolio

we will continue to pursue both disposition and acquisition opportunities that arise in results of operations a summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three year period ended december   follows in thousands  except number of properties and per share amounts rental operations revenues from continuing operations service operations revenues from continuing operations earnings from continuing rental operations earnings from continuing service operations operating income net income available for common shares weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common and dilutive potential common shares basic income per common share continuing operations discontinued operations diluted income per common share continuing operations discontinued operations number of in service properties at end of year in service square footage at end of year under development square footage at end of year comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental income from continuing operations rental income from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the following table reconciles rental income from continuing operations by reportable segment to total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended december  and in thousands office industrial retail other total our three reportable segments comprising rental operations office  industrial and retail are all within the real estate industry  however  the same economic and industry conditions do not necessarily affect them 
the primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below our in service occupancy increased from at december   to at december  improving occupancy continues to be a key management goal in during the year ended  we acquired new properties and placed development projects in service 
these acquisitions and developments are the primary factors in the overall million increase in rental revenue for the year ended  compared to the same period in the property acquisitions totaled million on million square feet and were leased at december  the two largest acquisitions were office buildings in atlanta and cincinnati 
the acquisitions provided revenues of million 
revenues from acquisitions that occurred during were million in compared to million in developments placed in service in provided revenues of million  while revenues associated with developments placed in service in totaled million in compared to million in the rental income shown above includes lease termination fees 
lease termination fees relate to specific tenants that pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
lease termination fees totaled million in  compared to in the decrease in termination fees corresponds with fewer corporate downsizings due to improving market conditions 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies 
these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
these earnings decreased from in to million in despite overall occupancy remaining relatively flat around 
the decrease in earnings is due to the following a tenant filed for bankruptcy in one joint venture property resulting in occupancy for the property at the end of being versus in we sold our interest in one joint venture in december and  as a result  no earnings were recorded in rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statement of operations for the years ended december  and in thousands rental expenses office industrial retail other total real estate taxes office industrial retail other total the increased rental and real estate tax expenses for  as compared to  were primarily the result of our increase in average in service square feet and occupancy 
these increases resulted from our acquisition activities and developments placed in service as noted above 
interest expense interest expense increased from million in to million in we issued new debt to fund debt maturities  new developments and acquisitions and to take advantage of the favorable interest rate environment 
the following is a summary of debt activities for in january  we obtained a million floating rate term loan and immediately fixed the rate at with two interest rate swaps 
we expect to pay off this loan in the first quarter of also in january  we issued million of unsecured debt with a four year maturity at 
in august we issued million of unsecured debt with a ten year maturity at an effective rate of 
in december we issued million of unsecured floating rate debt at basis points over libor 
the debt matures in two years  but is callable at our option after six months 
in august  we paid off million of a million secured floating rate term loan 
we also assumed million of secured debt in conjunction with a property acquisition in atlanta 
the average balance and average borrowing rate of our million revolving credit facility were slightly higher in than in at the end of we were not utilizing our credit facility 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in as a result of increased capital spending associated with increased leasing  the additional basis resulting from acquisitions  development activity and the application of sfas as described below 
the points below highlight the significant increase in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense on tenant improvements increased by million 
depreciation expense on buildings increased by million 
lease commission amortization increased by million 
the amortization expense associated with acquired lease intangible assets increased by approximately million 
the acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with sfas  which requires the allocation of a portion of a property s purchase price to intangible assets for leases acquired and in place at the closing date of the acquisition 
these intangible assets are amortized over the remaining life of the leases generally years as compared to the building basis portion of the acquisition  which is depreciated over years 
service operations service operations primarily consist of our merchant building sales and the leasing  management  construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties 
these operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy as leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on businesses expanding operations 
service operations earnings increased from million in to million in the increase reflects higher construction volumes partially offset by increased staffing costs for our new national development and construction group and construction jobs in certain markets 
other factors impacting service operations are discussed below 
we experienced a decrease in our overall gross profit margin percentage in our general contractor business in as compared to  due to continued competitive pricing pressure in many of our markets 
we expect margins to increase in as economic conditions improve 
however  despite this decrease  we were able to increase our net general contractor revenues from million in to million in because of an increase in volume 
this volume increase was attributable to continued low financing costs available to businesses  thereby making it more attractive for them to own instead of lease facilities 
we have a substantial backlog of million for third party construction as of december   that will carry into our merchant building development and sales program  whereby a building is developed by us and then sold  is a significant component of construction and development income 
during  we generated after tax gains of million from the sale of six properties compared to million from the sale of four properties in profit margins on these types of building sales fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold  the strength of the underlying tenant and nature of the sale  such as a pre contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in the increase was a result of increased staffing and employee compensation costs to support development of our national development and construction group 
we also experienced an increase in marketing to support certain new projects 
other income and expenses earnings from sales of land and ownership interests in unconsolidated companies  net of impairment adjustments  is comprised of the following amounts in and in thousands gain on sale of joint venture interests gain on land sales impairment adjustment total in the first quarter of  we sold our interest in a joint venture that owned and operated depreciable investment property 
the joint venture developed and operated real estate assets  thus  the gain was not included in operating income 
gain on land sales are derived from sales of undeveloped land owned by us 
we pursue opportunities to dispose of land in markets with a high concentration of undeveloped land and in those markets where the land no longer meets our strategic development plans 
the increase was partially attributable to a land sale to a current corporate tenant for potential future expansion 
we recorded  and  of impairment charges associated with contracts to sell land parcels for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   only one parcel on which we recorded impairment charges is still owned by us 
we anticipate selling this parcel in the first quarter of discontinued operations we have classified operations of buildings as discontinued operations as of december  these buildings consist of industrial  office and five retail properties 
as a result  we classified net income from operations  net of minority interest  of million  million and million as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  of the properties classified in discontinued operations were sold during  properties were sold during  two properties were sold during and one operating property is classified as held for sale at december  the gains on disposal of these properties  net of impairment adjustment and minority interest  of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  are also reported in discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   a million loss on disposal of properties  net of impairment adjustments and minority interest  is reported in discontinued operations due to impairment charges of million recorded on three properties in that were later sold in and comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental income from continuing operations rental income from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the following table reconciles rental income by reportable segment to our total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended december  and in thousands office industrial retail other total although our three reportable segments comprising rental operations office  industrial and retail are all within the real estate industry  they are not necessarily affected by the same economic and industry conditions 
for example  our retail segment experienced high occupancies and strong overall performance during  while our office and industrial segments reflected the weaker economic environment for those property types 
the primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below during  in service occupancy improved from at the end of to at the end of the second half of was highlighted by a significant increase in the industrial portfolio occupancy of along with a slight increase in office portfolio occupancy of 
lease termination fees totaled million in compared to million in most of this decrease was attributable to the office segment  which recognized million of termination fees in as compared to million in lease termination fees relate to specific tenants that pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
the high volume of termination fees in was reflective of the contraction of the business of large office users during that year and their desire to downsize their use of office space 
the decrease in termination fees for was indicative of an improving economy and a more stable financial position of our tenants 
during the year ended  we acquired million of properties totaling million square feet 
the acquisitions were primarily class a office buildings in existing markets with overall occupancy near 
revenues associated with these acquisitions totaled million in in addition  revenues from acquisitions totaled million in compared to million in this significant increase is primarily due to a large office acquisition that closed at the end of december developments placed in service in provided revenues of million  while revenues associated with developments placed in service in totaled million in compared to million in proceeds from dispositions of held for rental properties totaled million in  compared to million in these properties generated revenue of million in versus million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies 
these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
these earnings decreased from million in to million in this decrease is a result of the following significant activity in  a million gain was recognized on a property that was developed and sold upon completion to a third party 
in  our total investment in joint ventures decreased 
this decrease was the result of our acquiring our partner s interest in three joint ventures  selling our interest in two and one venture being dissolved in while the number of joint ventures decreased  the joint ventures occupancy increased from to in rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statement of operations for the years ended december  and in thousands rental expenses office industrial retail other total real estate taxes office industrial retail other total the increased rental and real estate tax expenses for  as compared to  was primarily the result of our increase in average in service square feet and occupancy 
these increases resulted from our acquisition activities and developments placed in service in interest expense our interest expense increased from million in to million in although we benefited from significantly lower interest rates during  interest expense increased because of increased borrowings during the year and a decrease in the amount of interest that was capitalized 
the increased borrowings reflected the funding of our developments during the year and the excess of properties acquired over those disposed 
interest capitalized for was significantly lower than as development activity for was substantially slower than prior years 
development starts for totaled only million compared to approximately million for other significant factors impacting interest expense for are summarized as follows we continued to replace secured debt financing with unsecured debt  and paid off over million of secured loans throughout the payoffs included secured loans due in and those due in and beyond for which we were able to take advantage of expired or negotiated lower pre payment penalties and utilize lower financing costs from unsecured debt offerings or the unsecured line of credit 
approximately million of new unsecured debt was issued in we issued million of seven year debt in january at an effective interest rate of  million of ten year debt in may at an effective interest rate of and million of four year debt in november at an effective interest rate of 
we retired million of debt in june that had an effective interest rate of we utilized our million unsecured line of credit more heavily in than during in order to take advantage of the historically low borrowing costs 
the balance on the line of credit was million at december  compared to million at december  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for increased by approximately million compared to because of an increase in tenant improvements and leasing costs 
as discussed earlier  we experienced higher overall occupancy and more acquisition activity in  which resulted in increased capital expenditures for tenant improvements and deferred lease commissions as well as increases in held for investment property basis 
the following highlights the significant changes in depreciable and amortizable property during the basis of the held for investment property portfolio increased by million as a result of our development and acquisition activity 
we incurred tenant improvement costs of million in we incurred lease commissions of million in the amortization associated with the acquired lease intangible assets recorded on acquisitions totaled million 
the acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with sfas  which requires the allocation of a portion of a property s purchase price to intangible assets for leases acquired and in place at the closing date of the acquisition 
these intangible assets are amortized over the remaining life of the leases generally years as compared to the building basis portion of the acquisition  which is depreciated over years 
service operations service operations primarily consist of leasing  management  construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties 
these operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy as leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on businesses expanding operations 
the following highlights the significant components of revenues in service operations we experienced more than a decrease in overall gross profit margin percentage in our general contractor business in because of more competitive pricing in many of our markets 
however  despite this decrease  we were able to increase net general contractor revenues from million in to million in because of a significant increase in volume 
this volume increase was attributable to the low cost of financing available to businesses  thereby making it more attractive for them to own instead of lease facilities 
property management  maintenance and leasing fee revenues have remained fairly constant between and  as the number of properties we managed has not changed significantly 
construction management and development activity income represents construction and development fees earned on projects where we act as the construction manager along with profits from our merchant building program under which we develop property with the intent to sell upon completion 
the decrease in revenues from million in to million in is primarily due to fewer properties being sold from the program in during  we sold eight properties for a net gain of million compared to the sale of four properties in for a net gain of million in profit margins on these types of transactions fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold  the strength of the underlying tenant and the nature of the sale  such as a pre contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased from million in to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in construction volume for third party projects resulting in a greater allocation of overhead to service operations operating expenses 
other income and expenses earnings from sales of land  depreciable property dispositions and ownership interests in unconsolidated companies  net of impairment adjustments  is comprised of the following amounts in and in thousands gain on sales of depreciable properties gain on sale of joint venture interests gain on land sales impairment adjustment total gain on sales of depreciable properties represent sales of previously held for investment rental properties which did not qualify to be classified as discontinued operations under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
there were no such sales in in  we sold our interests in two joint ventures that owned and operated depreciable investment property 
we owned of each of these joint ventures 
gain on land sales represents sales of undeveloped land we owned 
we pursue opportunities to dispose of land in markets with a high concentration of undeveloped land and those markets where the land no longer meets our strategic development plans 
we recorded  of impairment charges on three land parcels that were sold in the million adjustment recorded in was associated with three properties determined to be impaired 
other revenue and expenses are comprised primarily of the write off of contract development costs for abandoned development projects and gains on terminations of interest rate swaps 
in  we recorded contract development expenses of million compared to million in we accumulate costs of potential projects as an asset until such time as the costs are capitalized into a new project or expensed for a failed project 
in  we terminated four forward starting interest rate swap agreements for a net gain of  the swap agreements were entered into as hedges for future anticipated debt issuances 
these agreements were terminated as a result of our capital needs being met through the issuance of the series j preferred stock in lieu of the contemplated debt issuances 
in  a million gain was recognized in connection with a swap that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
see discussion of our use of derivative instruments in the footnotes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based upon available information and experience 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors 
the following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements  degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions accounting for joint ventures we analyze our investments in joint ventures under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation 
we have equity interests ranging from in joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or substantial participating rights 
control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day to day operations  refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner 
we use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial polices 
under the equity method of accounting  our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet  however  the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet 
cost capitalization direct and certain indirect costs  including interest  clearly associated and incremental to the development  construction  leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property 
the following discusses the significant categories of costs we incur within our rental operations  direct and indirect costs are capitalized under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects sfas  and interest costs are capitalized under the guidelines of sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost sfas 
we capitalize these project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
we believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry 
the interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt 
in addition  we capitalize costs  including interest costs  on vacant space during extended lease up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use 
if costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease  then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed 
once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space  project costs are no longer capitalized 
we cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease up periods after the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains a occupancy 
we follow guidelines in sfas and sfas in determining the capitalization of project costs during the lease up period of a property and believe that this treatment is consistent with real estate industry standards for project cost capitalization 
all direct construction and development costs associated with the development of a new property are capitalized 
in addition  all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
a portion of our indirect costs considered directly related and incremental to construction development and leasing efforts are capitalized 
in assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized  we first allocate payroll costs  on a department by department basis  among activities for which capitalization is warranted ie  construction  development and leasing and those for which capitalization is not warranted ie  property management  maintenance  acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions 
to the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non capitalizable activities  the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity 
once the payroll costs are allocated  the non payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs 
the capitalized cost pool does not include any costs allocable to our executive officers 
to ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized  the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed 
these standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease 
these standards are derived after considering both the amount of costs that would need to be paid by us if the services were performed by third parties  and the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity 
the use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized by us 
impairment of real estate investments we evaluate our real estate investments upon occurrence of significant changes in the operations  but not less than annually  to assess whether any impairment indications are present that affect the recovery of the recorded value 
if any real estate investment is considered impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we utilize the guidelines established under sfas to determine if impairment conditions exist 
under sfas  we review the expected undiscounted cash flows of each property in our held for rental portfolio to determine if there are any indications of impairment of a property 
the review of anticipated cash flows involves subjective assumptions of estimated occupancy and rental rates and ultimate residual value 
in addition to reviewing anticipated cash flows  we assess other factors such as changes in business climate and legal factors that may affect the ultimate value of the property 
these assumptions are subjective and the anticipated cash flows may not ultimately be achieved 
real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value amount or the fair value less estimated cost to sell 
acquisition of real estate property 
in accordance with sfas  we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
the allocation to tangible assets buildings  tenant improvements and land is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above or below market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values  based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
valuation of receivables we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  we perform in house credit review and analysis on major existing tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
we have established the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables and record allowances we maintain a tenant watch list containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk 
various factors such as late rent payments  lease or debt instrument defaults  and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list 
as a matter of policy  we reserve the entire receivable balance  including straight line rent  of any tenant with an amount outstanding over days 
straight line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long term risk  regardless of the status of rent receivables  are reviewed and reserved as necessary 
revenue recognition on construction contracts we recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method 
using this method  profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts 
a portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
this revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes 
with regards to critical accounting policies  management has discussed the following with the audit committee criteria for identifying and selecting  methodology in applying  and impact on the financial statements 
the audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies we identified 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we expect to meet our liquidity requirements over the next twelve months  including payments of dividends and distributions as well as recurring capital expenditures relating to maintaining our current real estate assets  primarily through the following working capital  and net cash provided by operating activities although we historically have not used any other sources of funds to pay for recurring capital expenditures on our current real estate investments  the use of borrowings or property disposition proceeds may be temporarily needed to fund such expenditures during periods of high leasing volume 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage debt maturities  preferred stock redemptions  the retirement of unsecured notes and amounts outstanding under the unsecured credit facility  property acquisitions  financing of development activities and other non recurring capital improvements  primarily from the following sources issuance of additional unsecured notes  issuance of additional preferred stock  undistributed cash provided by operating activities  if any  and proceeds received from real estate dispositions 
rental operations we believe our principal source of liquidity  cash flows from rental operations  provides a stable source of cash to fund operational expenses 
we believe this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition except for periodic straight line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition 
we are subject to risks of decreased occupancy through market conditions as well as tenant defaults and bankruptcies  and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re letting of properties  which would result in reduced cash flow from operations 
however  we believe that these risks are mitigated by our strong market presence in most locations and the fact that we perform in house credit review and analysis on major tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
credit facilities we had one unsecured line of credit available at december   described as follows in thousands description borrowing capacity maturity date interest rate outstanding at december unsecured line of credit january libor 
the stated interest rate under the line is libor plus sixty basis points 
however  the facility provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line  at rates lower than the stated interest rate  subject to certain restrictions 
at december   we were not using this facility 
the line of credit facility also contains financial covenants that require us to meet defined levels of performance 
as of december   we are in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
debt and equity securities we currently have on file with the sec an effective shelf registration statement that permits us to sell up to an additional million of unsecured debt securities and an additional million of common and preferred stock as of december  from time to time  we expect to issue additional securities under these registration statements to fund development and acquisition of additional rental properties and to fund the repayment of the credit facility and other long term debt upon maturity 
the indenture governing our unsecured notes also requires us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations 
we are currently in compliance with all such covenants and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
sale of real estate assets we utilize sales of real estate assets as an additional source of liquidity 
we pursue opportunities to sell real estate assets and prune our older portfolio properties when beneficial to our long term strategy 
uses of liquidity our principal uses of liquidity include the following property investments  recurring leasing capital costs  dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders  long term debt maturities  and other contractual obligations 
property investments we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon market outlook  supply  and long term growth potential 
recurring expenditures a summary of our recurring capital expenditures is as follows for the year ended december in thousands tenant improvements leasing costs building improvements totals the increase in recurring capital expenditures is the result of higher leasing activity during our lease renewal percentage increased from in to in dividends and distributions in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must currently distribute at least of our taxable income to shareholders 
we paid dividends per share of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to distribute taxable earnings to meet the requirements to maintain our reit status 
however  distributions are declared at the discretion of our board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution  our financial condition  capital requirements and such other factors  as our board of directors deems relevant 
debt maturities debt outstanding at december   totaled billion with a weighted average interest rate of maturing at various dates through we had billion of unsecured debt and million of secured debt outstanding at december  scheduled principal amortization of such debt totaled million for the year ended december  following is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at december  in thousands future repayments weighted average year scheduled amortization maturities total interest rate of future repayments thereafter historical cash flows a comparison of our historical cash flows for  and is as follows in millions years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities operating activities cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational requirements of our rental operations and merchant building activities 
the receipt of rental income from rental operations continues to provide the primary source of our revenues and operating cash flows 
in addition  we also develop buildings with the intent to sell  which provides another significant source of operating cash flow activity 
during the year ended december   we incurred merchant building development costs of million compared to million for the year ended december  the difference is reflective of the timing of activity in the held for sale pipeline as we had significant sales of these properties during the fourth quarter of  thus  the development costs were much higher for the pipeline of held for sale projects under construction as of december  has anticipated costs of million 
we sold six merchant buildings in  for a net after tax gain of million as compared to four in for a net after tax gain of million 
investing activities investing activities are one of the primary uses of our liquidity 
development and acquisition activity typically generates additional rental revenues and provides cash flows for operational requirements 
highlights of significant cash uses are as follows development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase reflects the overall improvement in the development climate during we anticipate development volume to increase in through new initiatives such as our  acre  mixed use project referred to as the anson project and our national development and construction group 
in the year ended december   we have significantly increased our costs associated with the acquisition of land held for development 
we acquired million of land in as compared to million in the significant increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of over acres of land at a cost of over million in our indianapolis market 
this initial acquisition is part of our  acre  mixed use anson project  which we anticipate will be developed over a year period 
recurring costs for tenant improvements  lease commissions and building improvements have continued to increase 
management anticipates that these costs will remain high as overall portfolio occupancy continues to increase 
sales of land and depreciated property provided million in net proceeds in  compared to million in sales of non strategic and older properties will continue to be utilized as part of our capital recycling program to fund acquisitions and new development while improving the overall quality of our investment portfolio 
financing activities we raised capital by borrowing from banks  utilizing the public debt markets and issuing preferred stock in in order to enhance our flexibility with respect to properties  we have continued to replace secured debt with unsecured debt 
our low leverage provides us with the opportunity to borrow funds at very attractive rates 
highlights of significant financing activities are as follows in february  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of our series k preferred stock 
these preferred shares were issued at a favorable dividend yield of 
the series k preferred shares issuance corresponded with the redemption of million of series e preferred shares in january  which carried an dividend rate 
we took advantage of the low interest rate environment in january when we issued million of unsecured debt at with a four year term 
the net proceeds from this unsecured offering were used to decrease the amounts outstanding under our unsecured line of credit 
in february  we called for the redemption of all the series d convertible preferred shares as of march  the redemption price of each depository share of the series d stock was  whereas each depository share was convertible into 
shares of our common stock 
since the value of our common stock was well in excess of the strike price per share during the redemption period  the vast majority of the series d shareholders elected to convert their shares into common stock 
prior to the redemption date   series d convertible preferred depositary shares were converted into  common shares  with the remaining  series d convertible preferred depositary shares redeemed for million on march  we paid million in cash to a group of warrant holders in exchange for the cancellation of their warrants in march 
the price paid represented the in the money value of the warrants based upon the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the price of the our common stock at the exercise date 
in august  we issued million of unsecured notes due in the notes were issued as part of an exchange of securities for million principal amount of our unsecured debt 
the remaining cash proceeds were used to finance costs associated with the offering and exchange of debt  and to reduce amounts outstanding under our unsecured line of credit 
in november  we issued our series l preferred stock and received approximately million in net proceeds 
these preferred shares were issued at a dividend yield of 
the proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under our unsecured line of credit that had partially increased as a result of the maturity and payment of million of medium term notes carrying an interest rate of 
in december  we issued million of unsecured floating rate debt at basis points over libor 
the debt matures in two years but is callable after six months 
the proceeds were used to pay off our credit line  which was not being utilized at december  credit ratings we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on senior unsecured notes from fitch ratings  moody s investor service and standard and poor s ratings group 
currently  fitch and standard and poor s have assigned a rating of bbb and moody s investors has assigned a rating of baa to the senior notes 
we also received investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock 
fitch and standard and poor s have assigned a preferred stock rating of bbb and moody s investors has assigned a preferred stock rating of baa these senior notes and preferred stock ratings could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
financial instruments we are exposed to capital market risk  such as changes in interest rates 
in order to manage the volatility relating to interest rate risk  we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we account for derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas 
during the first quarter of  we funded a million note receivable secured by a first mortgage on a portfolio of office properties owned by a third party located in atlanta  georgia 
the note receivable had a maximum two year term with an interest rate of for the first months and thereafter 
in order to fund the note receivable  we borrowed million under a variable interest rate term loan 
the loan bears interest at the rate of libor basis points  has a maturity date of january  and contains two six month renewal options 
to hedge our variable interest rate risk on the loan  we entered into two interest rate swaps totaling million that effectively fixed the rate at through maturity 
the hedge accounting rules are being used for the swaps  which allow for changes in market value of the swaps to be recorded through other comprehensive income oci in equity versus earnings in the statement of operations 
in the third quarter of  the million note receivable was repaid in connection with our acquisition of the properties that secured the note 
however  our million note payable and related interest swaps were not retired 
as of december   the fair value of the hedge was  which was reflected through an increase in other assets and oci on our balance sheet 
in june  we simultaneously entered into three forward starting interest rate swaps aggregating million  which effectively fixed the rate on financing expected in at  plus our credit spread over the swap rate 
the swaps qualified for hedge accounting under sfas  therefore  changes in the fair value were recorded in oci 
in august  we settled these three swaps when we issued million of unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of  due in we paid million to unwind the swaps  which will be amortized from oci into interest expense over the life of the new notes 
in december  we simultaneously entered into two million forward starting interest rate swaps as a hedge to effectively fix the rate on unsecured debt financings expected in then again in february  we simultaneously entered into two additional million forward starting interest rate swaps as a hedge to effectively fix the rate on unsecured debt financings expected in all four swaps qualified for hedge accounting under sfas  therefore  changes in fair value were recorded in other comprehensive income 
in july  we terminated the swaps for a net gain of  which is included in other revenue in the statements of operations 
the swaps were terminated because our capital needs were met through the issuance of the series j preferred stock in lieu of the previously contemplated issuance of debt 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million gain associated with an interest rate contract that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
the contract expired on december  in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and otherwise is effective july  we include the operations of one joint venture in our consolidated financial statements 
this joint venture is partially owned by unaffiliated parties that have noncontrolling interests 
sfas requires the disclosure of the estimated settlement value of these noncontrolling interests 
as of december   the estimated settlement value of the noncontrolling interest in this consolidated joint venture was approximately million as compared to the minority interest asset recorded on our books for this joint venture of  off balance sheet arrangements investments in unconsolidated companies we have equity interests ranging from in unconsolidated companies that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
the equity method of accounting is used for these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over operating and financial policies 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet 
our investment in unconsolidated companies represents less than of our total assets as of december  these investments provide several benefits to us  including increased market share  tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects 
the following tables presents summarized financial information for unconsolidated companies for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentages dugan realty  llc dugan texas  llc dugan office  llc other industrial and office joint ventures total land  buildings and tenant improvements  net land held for development other assets property indebtedness other liabilities owners equity rental income net income total square feet percent leased company ownership percentage off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities  which are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other specific purposes 
contractual obligations as of december   we are subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt line of credit share of mortgage debt of unconsolidated joint ventures ground leases operating leases development and construction backlog costs future land acquisitions service contracts other total contractual obligations our long term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at december  our unsecured line of credit matures in we were not using our line of credit at december  our share of unconsolidated mortgage debt includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at december  represents estimated remaining costs on the completion of held for rental  held for sale and third party construction projects 
these land acquisitions are subject to the completion of due diligence requirements  resolution of certain contingencies and completion of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing conditions 
if we were to terminate these contracts  we would forfeit our total escrow amount of  and would have no further contractual obligations 
service contracts defined as those which cover periods greater than one year and are not cancelable without cause by either party 
represents the contracted purchase price of a building 
related party transactions we provide property management  leasing  construction and other tenant related services to properties in which former executive officers and current directors have ownership interests 
we received fees totaling approximately  million  and million in  and  respectively  for services provided to these properties 
the fees we charged for such services are equivalent to those charged to unrelated third party owners for similar services 
we had an option to acquire the executive officers interests in these properties 
two of these properties  the bank one towers office buildings in cincinnati  ohio  were acquired in august at a price of million 
the terms of this acquisition were reviewed and approved by the independent members of our board of directors 
the options on the remaining properties expired in october  as the independent members of our board of directors determined that it was not in our best interest to exercise the options 
we provide property management  leasing  construction and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have an equity interest 
for each of the years ended december   and  we received management fees of million from these unconsolidated companies 
in addition  for each of the years ended december   and  respectively  we received from these entities leasing fees of million  million and million and construction and development fees of million  million and million 
these fees were charged at market rates and we eliminated our ownership percentage of these fees in the consolidated financial statements 
in  we received lease termination fees totaling million from a tenant that is a subsidiary of progress energy  inc at that time  william cavanaugh iii was president and chief executive officer of progress energy  inc and a member of our board of directors 
our independent directors approved the transaction and management believes that the amount received approximates a value that would have been charged to tenants with similar lease terms and commitments 
commitments and contingencies in and  certain members of management and the board of directors purchased million of common stock in connection with an executive and senior officer stock purchase plan 
the purchases were financed by five year personal loans at market interest rates from financial institutions 
as of december   the outstanding balance on these loans was approximately million as some participants have extended their involvement in the program beyond the original five years 
these loans were secured by common shares with a fair market value of approximately million purchased through this program and owned by the remaining plan participants at december  as a condition of the financing agreement with the financial institution  we guaranteed repayment of principal  interest and other obligations for each participant  but are fully indemnified by the participants 
in the opinion of management  it is not probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees 
in october  we sold or contributed industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair value of million to a joint venture dugan realty llc in which we have a interest and recognized a net gain of million 
this transaction expanded an existing joint venture with an institutional real estate investor 
as a result of the total transactions  we received million of proceeds 
the joint venture partially financed this transaction with million of secured mortgage debt  the repayment of which we directly or indirectly guaranteed 
the guarantee associated with million of such debt expired in december without us being required to satisfy the guarantee 
the remaining million of such debt is still guaranteed by us 
in connection with this transaction  the joint venture partners were given an option to put up to a million interest in the joint venture to us in exchange for our common stock or cash at our option  subject to certain timing and other restrictions 
as a result of this put option  we deferred million of gain on sale of depreciated property and recorded a million liability 
we have guaranteed the repayment of million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments 
we will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service 
management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees 
we have also guaranteed the repayment of a million mortgage loan encumbering the real estate of one of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
management believes that the value of the real estate exceeds the loan balance and that we will not be required to satisfy this guarantee 
we evaluated our guarantees under fasb interpretation fin in order to determine the amount of potential liability we may incur resulting from the guarantees 
for this evaluation we used discounted cash flow projections for expected incremental financing to be generated from anticipated development 
based upon these projections  no liability was recorded at december  we have entered into agreements  subject to the completion of due diligence requirements  resolution of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing conditions  for the future acquisition of land totaling million 
we have also entered into an agreement to acquire a single building for million  which is expected to close in we renewed all of our major insurance policies in these policies include coverage for acts of terrorism for our properties 
we believe that this insurance provides adequate coverage against normal insurance risks and that any loss experienced would not have a significant impact on our liquidity  financial position  or results of operations 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and is effective july we are currently evaluating the impact on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long term debt borrowings 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques
