such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the reader should be aware that  should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  the actual plan of operations  business strategies  operating results and financial position of sport haley  inc could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  such forward looking statements 
our business in general is subject to certain risks including the following the demand for our products may decrease if the popularity of golf decreases or if other factors  such as adverse business conditions  a sluggish economy or inclement weather  cause golfers not to patronize golf professional shops 
we must continue to successfully anticipate fashion trends  design apparel that is accepted by consumers as fashionable and stylish and maintain an adequate product mix thereof in order to continue to have market acceptance 
our sales are seasonal  and historically sales from july through december  which comprise our first and second fiscal quarters  are weaker than sales from january through june  which comprise our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the market for golf apparel is extremely competitive  price competition or industry consolidation could weaken our competitive position 
in order to maintain our competitive position  we must effectively advertise and communicate within the marketplace and successfully penetrate our chosen distribution channels 
we maintain a significant level of finished goods inventories to support our sales volume and our limited corporate apparel program 
disposal of excess prior seasons inventories at reduced margins is an inherent characteristic within the golf apparel industry  but a significant amount of sales at the lower margins dictated by the disposition of excess inventories may impair our financial condition and the results of our operations 
write downs with regard to obsolete inventories could also continue to adversely affect our financial condition 
we depend on timely delivery of finished garments from our suppliers 
the loss of certain suppliers  and or delays in receiving garments from suppliers caused by various factors  including lost or reduced manufacturing capacity of significant suppliers  labor shortages  timely performance of third parties  and transportation difficulties  and others  could adversely affect our ability to make timely delivery of finished garments to our customers 
our significant reliance on foreign suppliers enhances the risk that revenues might be adversely affected if a foreign shipment were lost or significantly delayed 
we maintain insurance for risk of loss including those relating to raw materials inventories shipped between foreign vendors and finished goods inventories shipped from foreign suppliers to our distribution facilities in denver  colorado 
however  significant reliance on foreign suppliers heightens the risk that we would be left with inadequate or unsatisfactory recourse should the goods received from the foreign suppliers be nonconforming 
our significant reliance on foreign suppliers sustains the risk that revenues might be adversely affected by changes in international trade quota systems for apparel or by deterioration in political and international trade relations between the united states of america and the foreign countries where the suppliers are located 
we purchase significant amounts of finished apparel from several separate foreign suppliers 
while we believe that we could obtain finished apparel from numerous other suppliers  if we were to lose or terminate the services of any of these significant suppliers  our short term ability to fulfill customers orders on a timely basis could be substantially impaired  thereby negatively affecting our financial position and the results of our operations 
we maintain a close working relationship with a certain foreign person who is responsible for maintaining relationships with and monitoring the performance of certain of our foreign suppliers 
while we believe that we could utilize other such persons to perform similar services  if we were to lose or terminate the services of this individual  our short term ability to fulfill customers orders on a timely basis could be substantially impaired  thereby negatively affecting our financial position and the results of our operations 
our significant reliance on foreign suppliers requires that we maintain satisfactory relationships with a commercial banking institution in order to have adequate access to capital to finance inventory purchases from the foreign suppliers via import letters of credit 
while we believe that we could obtain access to capital from other sources  if the commercial banking institution were to terminate or not to renew the line of credit agreement that we maintain with the institution  our short term ability to purchase finished goods inventories from foreign suppliers could be substantially impaired  thereby negatively affecting our financial position and the results of our operations 
an ever increasing percentage of our net sales are derived from sales related to the license agreement with callaway to market and distribute ben hogan apparel 
while we believe that we maintain a satisfactory relationship with callaway  an early termination of the license agreement could negatively impact our financial position and results of our operations significantly 
as previously reported  sport haley  inc  our late chairman and our former controller  have been named in a civil enforcement action by the securities and exchange commission the sec 
we have incurred a significant amount of legal and other expenses defending the sec action 
subject to the terms of applicable insurance coverage  we may incur additional expenses  including company resources and executive time  in responding to and defending the action  which could negatively impact our financial position and the results of our operations 
we have submitted a settlement proposal to the sec  but  if the settlement proposal is not approved by the full commission  sport haley  inc and the named individuals could be subject to certain civil penalties and disgorgement  if the sec action were successful  which could negatively impact our financial position and the results of our operations 
the increased threats of terrorist activities in the united states  the conflict in iraq and other international conflicts may have adversely affected our sales 
business trends of the golf apparel industry closely follow trends in the travel and leisure sectors of the united states economy 
international conflicts and other geopolitical conditions resulting from threats or acts of war or terrorism and responses thereto may have continued to affect the travel and leisure sectors that had already been negatively impacted by the general economic downturn experienced during previous years 
our sales could decrease if the usa economy weakens due to these or other factors 
we may experience an increase in the number and magnitude of delinquent or uncollectible customer accounts during periods of economic downturn 
businesses in general are ever increasingly dependent upon computer information systems 
we must continually establish and sustain controls with regard to maintaining the integrity of our technology and information systems in order to adequately manage business activities and control costs and expenses 
on a limited basis  we advance monies to certain of our independent wholesale sales representatives under agreements whereby the sales representatives reimburse us as they earn monthly sales commissions 
our financial results may be adversely affected should the sales representatives not generate wholesale sales sufficient to justify the amounts advanced to them under the agreements 
there may be other factors not mentioned above  in the discussion below or included in our other securities and exchange commission filings that may cause actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statements 
neither the company nor any of its corporate officers or key employees assumes any obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or developments  except as required by applicable securities laws 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in the footnotes to the financial statements included in this report on k 
the estimates used by management are based upon our historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of our operations and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
inventories  predominately comprised of finished goods  are generally valued at the lower of cost weighted average or market 
costs include amounts paid to suppliers for packaged apparel and or materials and labor  import costs  such as customs duties  freight in and other miscellaneous costs  and allocated overhead 
after we implemented our operations software in january  we discovered certain programming and human errors within the new system that adversely affected the software s ability to accurately compute the valuation of our finished goods inventories using a weighted average method 
we consider the programming and human errors  which caused us to use a standard cost method  to be a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting with respect to inventory valuation 
the system was designed to utilize a series of complex valuation computations  and we determined that a manual reconstruction of the numerous amount of transactions affected by the programming and human errors was impracticable 
this weakness in our controls prevented us from relying upon the system recorded transactions with respect to inventory valuations during fiscal and based upon analyses performed to compare the landed cost components of our finished goods inventories with respect to our standard cost components and analyses of the allocated overhead portion of our standard costs  we concluded with reasonable assurance that recomputing the value of our finished goods inventories using a standard cost method yielded a fair estimation of the value of our finished goods inventories 
we used the standard cost method to value our finished goods inventories from the fiscal quarter ended march   through the fiscal quarter ended march  at june   certain inventory items remained on hand that had been valued using the standard cost method 
the methods we use to determine the standard costs of our finished good inventories have not changed since our initial analyses of such costs were performed in fiscal had we been able to rely upon the system to properly compute the cost of our finished goods inventories using the weighted average method  we believe that the weighted average method would not have yielded a materially different computation of the value than the standard cost method that we applied 
the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting with respect to inventory valuation impaired our ability to rely upon information created by our computer system to fairly present  in all material respects  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for fiscal and the inability of our computer system to properly calculate the valuation of our finished goods inventories using a weighted average cost assumption also affected the system recorded amounts within our cost of goods sold during fiscal and costs associated with invoiced sales and returns as well as inventory adjustments are natural components of our cost of goods sold 
because we concluded with reasonable assurance that our using a standard cost assumption yielded a fair estimation of our finished goods inventories during fiscal and  and because we consistently recorded adjustments to inventories as components of cost of goods sold  we believe with reasonable assurance that our cost of goods sold are fairly stated for fiscal and therefore  we believe that the procedures we applied to value our finished goods inventories in fiscal and provide us with reasonable assurance that our financial statements and the notes thereto fairly state  in all material respects  our financial condition  the results of our operations and our cash flows 
based upon tests we performed subsequent to june   we believe that the computer software has been properly programmed  and employees have been adequately trained to utilize the system procedures  to accurately compute our finished goods inventory valuations using a weighted average cost assumption beginning in fiscal excess finished goods inventories are a natural component of a seasonal apparel business 
while certain finished goods items will sell out in any particular selling season  quantities of other finished goods items will remain at the end of each selling season 
we market previous seasons finished goods inventories at reduced wholesale prices to our customers in the normal course of business 
remaining excess inventories are liquidated through other markets 
in the ordinary course of business  we maintain reserves for inventory write downs due to the obsolescence of discontinued or aging merchandise 
we perform analyses on a quarterly basis to identify unsold discontinued or aging merchandise and adjust our reserves for inventory obsolescence to reduce the carrying value of discontinued or aging merchandise to its estimated net realizable value 
the net realizable value of the discontinued or aging merchandise is estimated based on management s disposition plans and historical experiences 
during fiscal  we recorded finished goods inventories write downs of  including a write down of  during the fourth fiscal quarter 
while management believes that our processes produce fair valuations of obsolete inventories  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional allowances may be required 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts  based upon enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
our significant deferred tax assets are related to net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes  stock based compensation and an unrealized loss for tax purposes on a common stock investment 
governing regulations require that our operating losses be carried forward for income tax purposes 
we have established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount expected to be recovered in future periods 
the estimates for deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance require us to exercise complex judgments 
we periodically review and adjust those estimates based upon the most current information available 
in accordance with sfas and based upon a review at june   of our utilization of deferred tax assets  we maintained a valuation allowance that effectively reduces our net deferred tax assets to zero 
while we continue to explore various strategies to return the company to profitability  we cannot be certain that our efforts will result in the generation of future profits 
because the recoverability of deferred tax assets is directly dependent upon future operating results  actual recoverability of deferred tax assets may differ materially from our estimates 
our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects a reserve that reduces our customer accounts receivable to the net amount estimated to be collectible 
estimating the credit worthiness of customers and the recoverability of customer accounts requires us to exercise considerable judgment 
in estimating the reserve for uncollectible accounts  we consider factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions  historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance 
from time to time  we also identify delinquent customer accounts for which a specific reserve is required 
at june   our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  including specific reserves approximating  with respect to certain delinquent customer accounts 
while we consider our processes to be adequate to effectively quantify our exposure to doubtful accounts  changes in economic  industry or specific customer conditions may result in recoverability of our doubtful accounts that differs materially from our estimates 
we record allowances for sales returns as net adjustments to customer accounts receivable 
when recording an allowance  the net method reduces customer accounts receivable and net sales by the estimated gross margin effect of the anticipated sales return 
generally  our selling terms preclude return of our products subsequent to the sale 
however  we have traditionally maintained limited programs that offer some customers the right to return certain finished goods items under predefined conditions  which we include as a component within our estimate of allowance for sales returns 
we review historical data and consider factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions and anticipated customer performance when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
at june   the company s allowance for sales returns was  significant changes in general economic or industry conditions may yield sales returns that differ materially from our estimates during fiscal  we began offering our independent wholesale sales representatives the right to return sample garments  at the end of the related marketing period for such merchandise  at no charge to the sales representative 
previously  we invoiced the sales representatives for sample garments at discounted wholesale prices 
the right to return offered to the representatives caused us to adopt a policy to account for the sample garments in a manner consistent with our accounting for consigned inventories  whereby we capitalize the cost of sales of such shipments 
further  we record an allowance to completely offset the amount receivable from the representatives for the garments and reverse the corresponding revenue effect of the sale 
the sales representative s accounts receivable balance  the related allowance and inventory costs are adjusted and a sale is recorded when the sales representative reimburses us for the cost of sample garments or the term for which the right of return was granted  expires 
upon return of the garments to us  the sales representative s accounts receivable balance and the related allowance are adjusted accordingly  the corresponding revenue effect of the return is reversed and the inventory items are returned to stock 
during  we discontinued the program that granted our independent sales representatives the right to return sample garments 
at june   our allowance for returns of sales representatives sample garments was  because the shipments and returns of sample garments made under the right to return policy must be tracked and adjusted manually  actual shipments and returns made in accordance with that policy may differ from our estimates 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in or derived from our statements of income for its fiscal years ended june   and  and fiscal year ended june  and consolidated net sales cost of goods sold gross profit other operating costs impairment of fixed assets loss from operations other income and expenses  net loss from operations before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for fiscal were  an increase of  or  as compared with net sales of  for fiscal we attribute the difference in net sales to factors such as the continued growth in sales of ben hogan apparel collections offset by the discontinuance of our haley reserve men s fashion apparel and a continued decrease in sales of sport haley women s fashion apparel 
for fiscal  our net sales of ben hogan apparel collections were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the increase in net sales between the fiscal years is indicative of the growth we have achieved with our ben hogan collections within the premium priced golf apparel market 
ben hogan is marketed in accordance with a license agreement we maintain with callaway golf company callaway 
the growth we have achieved with the ben hogan collections since the inception of the license agreement far exceeds the minimum calendar year sales requirements of the agreement  and we consider the license agreement with callaway to be a key component of our overall business strategies 
while we believe that we have a strong working relationship with callaway  our trend of continuing increases in sales of licensed apparel since the introduction of ben hogan golf apparel collections  sustains a risk of loss should the license agreement with callaway be terminated by either party 
as previously reported  we discontinued our haley reserve men s fashion apparel beginning with our spring selling season  in part because of its diminishing sales and in part because we had expected to introduce top flite branded apparel in its place within our distribution channels 
we began shipping our spring apparel collections during november we believe that the discontinuance of our haley reserve men s fashion apparel negatively impacted our fiscal sales by at least  the total of our net sales for such apparel during our spring selling season 
historically  sales within our haley branded apparel have been disproportionately comprised of greater sales of women s apparel than of men s apparel 
overall  net sales of our haley branded apparel decreased by  or  from net sales of  for fiscal to net sales of  for fiscal the continued decline in sales of our sport haley women s fashion apparel appears to be related to a shrinking market for women s golf apparel  because our customers appear to be placing less importance on women s fashion golf apparel within their shops 
in fiscal  we consolidated our network of independent wholesale sales representatives to allow our representatives to market both our sport haley women s collections and our ben hogan men s collections simultaneously 
we believe that the natural synergies between the two brands will assist us with mitigating the negative effects on our operations associated with a shrinking of the women s golf apparel market 
for fiscal  ben hogan branded apparel revenues accounted for  haley branded apparel revenues accounted for and embroidering and shipping revenues accounted for of our net sales  respectively 
comparatively  for fiscal  ben hogan branded apparel revenues accounted for  haley branded apparel revenues accounted for and embroidering and shipping revenues accounted for of our net sales  respectively 
gross profit for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  as compared with  in fiscal the difference in gross profit between the fiscal years was primarily attributable to the following factors i as previously reported  during fiscal  we revised our procedures used to assess the recoverability of our finished goods inventories by using an improved method that calculates the estimated sales value based upon the quantities and mix of inventories that are expected to remain at the end of the selling season  rather than an estimate based upon the total number of units on hand that we used previously 
using the new recoverability assessment method  the net effect of inventory write downs negatively impacted our gross profit for fiscal by  comparatively  in fiscal  inventory write downs negatively impacted our gross profit by  ii in fiscal  we disposed of a significant portion of our excess finished goods inventories relating to our fall and prior selling seasons 
as we previously reported  in december  we sold substantially all of our discontinued or aging finished goods inventories from the spring and earlier selling seasons to a major retailer 
while we had previously estimated the recoverability of those inventories  we recognized an additional loss of  upon their disposition in december because we have not recognized a material loss on additional dispositions of aging or obsolete finished goods inventories after december  we believe that the methods we now use to estimate the recoverability of our finished goods inventories produce a fair estimate of their respective value 
iii as previously reported  in conjunction with performing procedures recommended by the developer of our software that were designed to correct a prior system malfunction  we performed a physical count of our finished goods inventories and performed a detailed review of our component inventories at december  the physical inventory caused us to reduce the value of our finished goods inventories by  and the detailed review caused us to reduce the value of our component inventories by  at december  the reductions in value similarly increased our cost of goods sold at december   thereby negatively impacting our gross profit for the period 
gross margin for fiscal was  a decrease of  from in fiscal our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies within the golf apparel industry 
we have consistently included the cost of merchandise sold  including import charges  in bound freight  allocated overhead and other charges  custom embroidery costs and freight out in our cost of goods sold 
amounts invoiced to our customers for custom embroidery as well as shipping and handling charges are included as components of our net sales 
our overhead allocation includes certain of our distribution costs  such as receiving  inspection and shipping costs  but we include some of the other costs of distribution  such as a portion of our warehousing and other handling costs  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we include royalty payments  relating to sales of licensed apparel  in other operating costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from  in fiscal the increase between fiscal years was due to a combination of several separate factors 
subsequent to the death of our chairman in september  we paid  in severance and other compensation expense to the late chairman s estate 
similarly  upon the departure of our former chief executive officer in october  we accrued  in severance and other compensation that is generally payable to the former executive over a three year period ending in march the death of our former chairman and the departure of our former chief executive officer contributed to a decrease in our total salary and other payroll expenses for fiscal salary and other payroll expenses  net of severance costs  totaled  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  from  in fiscal as we previously reported  near the end of december  we performed a detailed analysis of the individual categories of our selling  general and administrative expenses  and we used our evaluation as a tool to streamline our operations further 
we are continuing to focus our efforts to find additional ways to decrease our overall operating expenses 
as a percentage of sales  our selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
royalty expense for fiscal was  an increase of  or  from  for fiscal the increase in royalty expense between the fiscal years was directly related to the increase in net sales of our ben hogan apparel collections 
total other income  net  for fiscal was  an increase of  or  from  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the difference between the fiscal years in the amounts of and the rates of interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
during fiscal  interest rates earned on our near risk free investments improved slightly over the nearly all time lows earned on such investments in fiscal cash equivalents and marketable securities are purchased from time to time in accordance with guidelines  which our board of directors previously approved  designed to maximize the rates of return achieved on near risk free investment balances 
loss from operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal was  a difference of  or  from  for fiscal net loss for fiscal was  a difference of  or  from  for fiscal the proportional disparity between the difference in losses from operations before provision for income taxes and the difference in net loss arose because of the differences in the financial statement effects of our valuations with respect to net deferred tax assets between the fiscal years 
the valuation of net deferred taxes between years may cause variations in effective tax rates that can vary significantly due to differences between the methods of recording certain transactions for financial statement purposes versus the methods for recognizing those transactions for tax purposes within the same fiscal period 
certain expenses recorded for financial statement purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes and certain deductions for tax purposes may not be recorded for financial statement purposes within the same fiscal year 
for fiscal  our provision for income taxes was  primarily because we increased a valuation allowance to effectively reduce our net deferred tax assets to zero 
we periodically review and adjust our valuation for deferred tax assets based upon the most current information available 
because of our trend of net losses in the current and most recent prior years  we believe that it is more probable than not that none of our deferred tax assets will be recovered  and  in fiscal  we maintained the valuation allowance that effectively reduces our deferred tax assets to zero 
while we continue to explore strategic alternatives to return the company to profitability  we cannot be certain that our efforts will result in the generation of future profits 
because the recoverability of deferred tax assets is directly dependent upon future operating results  actual recoverability of our deferred tax assets may differ materially from our estimates 
income tax expense for the period equals taxes payable for the period plus the change during the period in our net deferred tax assets 
in fiscal and  we paid  and in applicable federal and state income taxes  respectively 
basic and diluted losses per share were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
due to the net losses for the respective fiscal years  all outstanding options were anti dilutive and therefore excluded from the loss per share calculations 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for fiscal were  an increase of  or  as compared with  for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a continued increase in the sales of ben hogan apparel combined with a continued decline in the sales of sport haley apparel 
the increase in ben hogan apparel sales exhibits growth we achieved within the premium price market for such apparel and is indicative of our effective strategies to maximize revenues associated with the callaway license agreement 
the continued decline in sales of sport haley apparel greatly concerned us 
we believed that the generally flat united states economy throughout fiscal contributed greatly to the depressed sales of sport haley apparel 
the sluggish economic conditions especially adversely affected sales of women s golf apparel throughout fiscal since women s apparel comprises a predominant portion of sport haley apparel sales  we may have been more significantly affected by the sluggish economic conditions than other competitors within the golf apparel industry 
while the golf apparel market is basically comprised of men s apparel and women s apparel  historically  our sport haley apparel sales have typically been comprised of men s apparel and women s apparel 
sales of sport haley men s apparel steadily declined for several years and were considerably less in fiscal than in previous years 
management spoke with a few long time customers that have indicated they were beginning to place less of an importance on stocking women s golf apparel collections 
therefore  we expected that the trend of increasing sales of ben hogan apparel and declining sales of sport haley apparel may continue into the foreseeable future 
we believe that there are natural synergies common to ben hogan men s apparel and sport haley women s apparel 
thus  during fiscal  we continued to consolidate our independent wholesale sales forces  and approximately of our independent sales representatives marketed both brands at june  by marketing ben hogan men s apparel in conjunction with sport haley women s apparel  we attempt to maintain our market share with current women s apparel customers and to expand the distribution channels for women s apparel into markets that we had previously only been able to penetrate via the marketing of ben hogan men s apparel  which has broader appeal within the golf apparel markets 
for fiscal  the sport haley men s and women s lines accounted for and of total net sales  respectively 
the sport haley elements line accounted for of total net sales  and ben hogan apparel accounted for of total net sales 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues 
for fiscal  the sport haley men s and women s lines accounted for and of total net sales  respectively 
the sport haley elements line accounted for of total net sales  and ben hogan apparel accounted for of total net sales 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues plus sales at the retail factory outlet store  which we used to sell prior seasons and other inventories at discounted retail prices 
the retail factory outlet store was closed in january gross profit for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  as compared with  in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the continued build up of excess and obsolete finished goods inventories during fiscal while excess and obsolete inventories are common within any apparel business  maintaining a minimum level of such inventories is a critical factor to the success an apparel business 
obsolete inventories are an especially critical factor to our success  because a significant portion of our inventories is comprised of women s apparel 
while obsolete men s golf apparel may be disposed of through several different outlets  market options available for the disposal of women s golf apparel are very limited 
therefore  our obsolete women s inventories are much more sensitive to devaluation than are our men s inventories 
our management performs quarterly analyses of our obsolete inventories and adjusts our reserve for inventory obsolescence to reduce the carrying value of obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
adjustments to the inventory valuation allowance are included as a component of our cost of goods sold 
an increase in obsolete inventories in fiscal affected cost of goods sold by  while a decrease in obsolete inventories in fiscal affected cost of goods sold by  respectively 
gross margin for fiscal was  a decrease of  from in fiscal the margin erosion in fiscal was primarily attributable to the effects of our build up in excess and obsolete finished goods inventories 
our management was extremely concerned about the continued build up 
in april  we performed an extensive evaluation of the processes we used for merchandise planning  product forecasting and excess inventory disposal 
the evaluation spawned inventory reduction initiatives for the disposal of excess inventories that utilized both current channels of distribution and large discount retail chains 
management expected that the inventory reduction initiatives and enhancements to our software systems would enable us to significantly reduce the levels of our finished goods inventories throughout fiscal management expected to reduce our finished goods inventories to approximately  by december   and to further reduce them to around  by june  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  an increase of  or  as compared with  in fiscal a significant portion of the increase was attributable to operating costs associated with ben hogan apparel 
selling  general and administrative expenses with respect to ben hogan for fiscal were approximately  an increase of  or  from  in fiscal contributing factors included in the increased ben hogan selling  general and administrative costs were higher amount of royalties paid to callaway and commissions paid to independent sales representatives on a corresponding increase in sales of ben hogan apparel  and  other increases in general expenses necessary to support the continued increase sales of ben hogan apparel 
another contributing factor to the total increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was an increase in total personnel expenses  a significant portion of which was attributable to severance compensation of  payable to the company s former president upon his termination at march  legal defense costs with respect to a securities and exchange commission investigation and civil enforcement action and a class action lawsuit filed against sport haley  inc and certain of its current and former officers and directors continued to contribute to increased selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal such legal costs approximated  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in september  the company received a reimbursement of approximately  from one of its insurance carriers relating to legal costs associated with the securities and exchange commission civil action and class action matters 
the company recorded the  as a receivable at june   and offset fiscal legal expenses by the same amount 
subject to the terms of the applicable insurance policies  we expected to receive further reimbursements for the costs of defense of the securities and exchange commission action as we had met the applicable retention amount 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for both fiscal and total other income  net  for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  as compared with  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the difference between the fiscal years in the amounts of  and the rates of interest earned on  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
during fiscal  interest rates on virtually risk free investments continued at or near all time lows 
we continued to search for investment alternatives available within the guidelines approved by our board of directors in order to maximize the rates of return achieved on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
income loss from operations before provision for benefit from income taxes for fiscal was  a decline of  or  as compared with  in fiscal net loss for fiscal was  a decline of  or  as compared with  in fiscal the proportional disparity between the difference in losses from operations before provision for income taxes and the difference in net losses between the fiscal years arose because of the differences in effective tax rates for financial statement  as opposed to tax  purposes 
the effective tax rate in any fiscal year can vary significantly from the effective tax rate in another year due to differences between the methods of recording certain transactions for financial statement versus the methods of recognizing those transactions for tax purposes 
certain deductions recognized for tax purposes may not be recorded for financial purposes in the same fiscal year  and certain expenses recorded for financial statement purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes in the same fiscal year 
the proportional disparity in provision for benefit from income taxes between fiscal and fiscal was primarily caused by differences in the valuation of net deferred tax assets 
because of the company s trend of net losses in the current and most recent prior years  management believed that it was more probable than not that none of our net deferred tax assets would be recovered 
therefore  we increased our valuation allowance at june   to effectively reduce our net deferred tax assets to zero 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are derived from our available cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and a working capital line of credit with a commercial bank 
we require cash for our general working capital purposes 
we do not anticipate requiring material amounts of cash for capital expenditures over the next months 
to the extent our cash balance is insufficient to finance our working capital needs  we may also make periodic borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
our working capital requirements are highly seasonal in nature  with greater requirements from approximately august through october and february through april of each fiscal year due to the purchases of finished goods inventories for the spring summer and fall holiday selling seasons  respectively 
working capital was  and  at june  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents plus marketable securities totaled  and  at june  and  respectively 
for purposes of the statements of cash flows  we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and present an insignificant risk of change in value due to changes in interest rates  to be cash equivalents 
net cash provided by used in operating activities totaled   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary components of adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash provided by used in operating activities were changes between fiscal years relating to impairments and write downs  deferred taxes  provisions for doubtful accounts and sales returns  accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes receivable  accounts payable  and accrued commissions and other expenses 
adjustments for impairments and write downs affected net cash provided by used in operating activities by  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the effects on net cash provided by used in operating activities caused by impairments and write downs represent the expense effects of recording impairments and write downs in the respective fiscal years 
because of the seasonal nature of the apparel business  excess inventories left over at the end of each selling season previous seasons inventories are common within the industry 
throughout each fiscal year  we market previous seasons inventories through our ordinary marketing channels 
at or near the end of each fiscal quarter  we identify and revalue obsolete inventories  primarily consisting of previous seasons inventories  to estimated disposition values 
write down charges relating to excess inventories have adversely affected our earnings and cash flows for the last several years 
in fiscal  we enacted initiatives directed to significantly reduce the levels of finished goods inventories in order to minimize the future adverse financial effect associated with the devaluation of obsolete inventories 
in fiscal  we sold a significant portion of our previous seasons inventories and refined our procedures to better estimate the recoverability our finished goods inventories  and we established new procedures for purchasing finished goods inventories designed to minimize the quantities expected to remain at the end of each selling season 
the effects on net cash provided by operating activities caused by changes in deferred taxes primarily represent the change in expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts 
we maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the net amount expected to be recovered in future periods 
in fiscal  because of the company s trend of net losses in the current and most recent prior years  we determined that it was more probable than not that none of our deferred tax assets would be recovered 
accordingly  since june   we have maintained a valuation allowance that effectively reduces our net deferred tax assets to zero 
while we continue to explore various strategies to return the company to profitability  we cannot be certain that our efforts will result in the generation of future profits

during fiscal  we discontinued the policy that granted the representatives the right to return sample garments 
as of june  our allowances for sample garments were  in fiscal   in fiscal and in fiscal the relative decrease in the allowance in fiscal  as compared with the allowance in fiscal  was due to our discontinuance of the right to return policy effective with the spring marketing season
