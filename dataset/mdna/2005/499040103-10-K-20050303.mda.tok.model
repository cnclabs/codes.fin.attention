item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we provide an estimate of the impact from a change in the discount rate used in the valuation of our pension plans 
competition and customer consolidation 
we are subject to aggressive competition in all areas of our business 
our newspapers compete for advertising and readers with other newspapers  broadcast  satellite and cable television  the internet and other computer services  radio  magazines  suburban newspapers  free shoppers  billboards and direct mail 
we could also be adversely affected by continued customer consolidation in the retail and national sectors  where we have experienced increased merger activity 
circulation 
the newspaper publishing industry was widely affected this past year by the enacted do not call rules and a series of circulation copy count restatements  which were isolated to certain other newspaper companies  but affected the credibility 
table of contents of our industry 
moreover  the newspaper publishing industry has experienced difficulty in recent years in sustaining circulation copy and revenue growth 
a prolonged decline in circulation copies could have a material effect on the rate and volume of advertising revenue 
we have implemented and strengthened various actions aimed at compliance with industrywide accepted practices in accounting and reporting of circulation copies and revenue 
we have also established a companywide circulation and content task force to find solutions to reverse industry trends 
self insurance and deductibles on casualty insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our health insurance costs  including claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
we also have deductibles of up to million on various casualty insurance programs  which we have determined to be adequate for the type of risk 
we estimate the liability under our health insurance and casualty programs on an actuarial undiscounted basis using individual case based valuations and statistical analysis that are based upon judgment and historical experience 
the final cost of many of these claims may not be known for several years  however 
we rely on the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
at december  and december   self insurance and casualty insurance accruals totaled million and million  respectively 
in connection with our insurance program  letters of credit totaling million are required to support certain projected workers compensation obligations 
we continuously review the adequacy of our insurance coverage

item legal proceedings knight ridder s wholly owned subsidiary  mediastream  inc mediastream  was named as one of a number of defendants in two separate class action lawsuits that have been consolidated with one other similar lawsuit by the judicial panel on multi district litigation under the caption in re literary works in electronic databases copyright litigation  mdl docket no 
the multi district litigation 
the two lawsuits originally filed against mediastream in september were the authors guild  inc et al 
v 
the dialog corporation et al  and posner et al 
v 
gale group inc et al 
these lawsuits were brought by or on behalf of free lance authors who allege that the defendants have infringed plaintiffs copyrights by making plaintiffs works available on databases operated by the defendants 
the plaintiffs are seeking to be certified as class representatives of all similarly situated free lance authors 
in the multi district litigation  plaintiffs seek actual damages  statutory damages and injunctive relief  among other remedies 
the two lawsuits were initially stayed pending disposition by the us supreme court of new york times company et al 
v 
tasini et al  no 
on june   the supreme court ruled that the defendants in tasini did not have a privilege under section of the copyright act to republish articles previously appearing in print publications absent the author s separate permission for electronic republication 
the judge has ordered the parties in the multi district litigation to 
table of contents try to resolve the claims through mediation  which commenced november  and the parties have agreed to a limited stay to respond to the complaint during such mediation  which may be terminated by the plaintiffs upon days prior written notice 
in september  the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint  which named knight ridder as an additional defendant and made reference to knight ridder digital 
settlement discussions that originally commenced during the mediation are continuing  and plaintiffs and defendants in the multi district litigation are in the process of obtaining and exchanging signatures to a proposed settlement agreement 
in the event that the foregoing parties are unable to finally settle this matter and the litigation resumes  knight ridder and mediastream intend to contest liability and vigorously defend their positions in the litigation  including opposing class certification 
in addition  mediastream has indemnity agreements from various content providers supplying articles to mediastream s databases that could mitigate its potential exposure 
if the settlement agreement is not finally concluded and the litigation resumes  there can be no assurance that we will prevail in the above legal proceedings and management cannot estimate the exposure if we do not prevail 
in such case  a ruling against us in the proceedings described above may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
in addition to the matters described above  we are also involved in litigation and administrative proceedings  primarily libel and copyright infringement actions  bankruptcy proceedings involving the company s advertisers  and environmental and other legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  except as set forth above  our liability  if any  under any other pending litigation or administrative proceedings  will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates general 
management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flows and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to incentives  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing arrangements  restructurings  long term service contracts  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this form k  for a detailed description of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition varies by source 
advertising revenue is recognized when advertisements are published 
circulation revenue is recognized when the newspaper is delivered to the customer 
other revenue is recognized when 
table of contents the related product or service has been delivered 
revenue is recorded net of estimated incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowance for bad debts 
we maintain a reserve account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we use a combination of the percentage of sales  specific identification and the aging of accounts receivable methods to establish allowances for losses on accounts receivable 
payment in advance for some advertising and circulation revenue and credit background checks  have assisted us in maintaining historical bad debt losses of less than of revenue 
barter transactions 
we enter into barter transactions with other businesses and we exchange our advertising and circulation for advertising products and distribution rights for our newspapers 
we also donate space to nonprofit organizations as part of our community outreach commitment 
the barter transactions  typically with terms of one year or less  are valued at fair market value based on our advertising rates for the particular type of advertisement 
at december   we had approximately million of future media advertisement  products and services arising from bartered transactions in net accounts receivable  which will be charged to expense as they are used 
we also have as of year end million in deferred advertising and circulation revenue arising from bartered transactions  which will be recorded as revenue when the advertisements are published and or the copies are delivered  respectively 
during the fiscal years ended  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  in bartered advertising and circulation revenue 
we periodically assess the recoverability of our barter credits and receivables 
factors considered in evaluating recoverability include management s plans with respect to advertising  circulation and other expenditures for which barter credits and receivables can be used 
any impairment losses are charged to operations  as they are determined 
equity and cost method investment valuation and accounting 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus and we record these investments at cost 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments 
in these cases  an impairment charge could be required in the future 
goodwill and other identified intangible asset impairment 
goodwill and other identified intangible assets arising from our acquisitions are subjected to periodic review for impairment 
sfas no 
requires an annual evaluation at the reporting unit level of the fair value of goodwill and compares the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to its book value to determine whether an impairment has occurred 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill or other identified intangible asset exceeds its implied fair value 
any impairment charge would be based on the most recent estimates of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangibles balances 
if the remaining book value assigned to goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition is higher than the amounts we currently would expect to realize based on updated financial and cash flow projections from the reporting unit  we would write down these assets 
we also record our share of impairment charges recorded by our equity method investees 
no impairment charges have been recorded to date relating to goodwill and other identified intangibles  except for an impairment recorded in for careerbuilder  one of our equity method investee 
pension and postretirement benefits 
we have significant pension and postretirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
these valuation assumptions include health care cost trend rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical results of the portfolio and management s expectation of the current economic environment 
the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields on aa rated corporate long term bond yields 
actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future life of the plan participants 
for an explanation of these assumptions  see note pension and other postretirement benefit plans on pages through while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect the pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
self insurance and deductibles on casualty insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our health insurance costs  including claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
we also have deductibles of up to million on various casualty insurance programs  which we have determined to be adequate for the type of risk 
we estimate the liability under our health insurance and casualty programs on an actuarial undiscounted basis using individual case based valuations and statistical analysis and are based upon judgment and historical experience  however  the final cost of many of these claims may not be known for several years 
we also rely on the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
at december  and december   self insurance and casualty insurance accruals totaled million and million  respectively 
in connection with our insurance program  letters of credit totaling million are required to support certain projected workers compensation obligations 
we continuously review the adequacy of our insurance coverage 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas accounting for income taxes  which 
table of contents requires the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are revalued to reflect new tax rates in the period changes are effective 
we file a federal consolidated income tax return and state consolidated  combined or separate income tax returns depending upon state requirements 
each of these filing jurisdictions may audit the tax returns filed and propose adjustments 
we maintain a liability to cover the cost of additional tax exposures on the filing of federal and state income tax returns 
adjustments arise from a variety of factors  including different interpretation of statutes and regulations 
legal 
we are involved in certain claims and litigation related to our operations  including ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business 
see note commitments and contingencies on pages through for further information 
our management reviews and determines which liabilities  if any  arising from these claims and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  liquidity  results of operations or properties 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
determination of the amount of reserves required for these contingencies is made after analysis and discussion with legal counsel 
commitments and contingencies 
we have ongoing purchase commitments with sp newsprint and ponderay  our two newsprint mill investments 
these future commitments are for the purchase of a minimum of million and million of newsprint in with sp newsprint and ponderay  respectively  at current market prices 
we also have a sales commitment with detroit newspapers to supply of their newsprint requirements  which in will be approximately million 
we have the resources necessary to fulfill these commitments in business summary we report two operating business segments newspaper and online 
the newspaper segment represented of total operating revenue 
advertising revenue within this segment represented of total operating revenue 
retail  classified and national advertising revenue represented  and  respectively  of total advertising revenue 
circulation revenue comprised of total operating revenue 
for further information  please refer to note business segments under the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
advertising revenue is primarily determined by the linage  rate and mix of advertisement 
the advertising rate depends largely on our market reach  primarily through circulation  and competitive factors 
circulation revenue is based on the number of copies sold and the subscription rate charged to customers 
our overall circulation makes us the second largest newspaper company in the united states 
we operate in several large metropolitan areas  and ours are the leading newspapers in most of the locations we serve 
to expand our core revenue sources we launched a revenue task force in to identify new sources of revenue 
we have been implementing those initiatives that we believe best fit our strategy and have the highest return 
we focused on the following areas national  automotive and help wanted  sales force staffing  paid content  niche publications  retail majors and rop zoning 
we also established a national marketing group in response to the rapidly evolving retail and national environments 
together  these initiatives added over million of advertising revenue in from through  our larger markets were particularly hard hit in the classified employment category  the result of the nationwide downturn in hiring 
in  classified employment revenue was up 
the major increases compared to were in contra costa  st 
paul  san jose  miami and fort worth 
our retail category increased compared to last year 
department store advertising was soft 
traditional department stores  like macy s and dillard s face strong competition from large department stores and they are working hard to realign and redefine their business strategies 
national advertising increased compared to the prior year 
the largest increase was in telecommunications  up for the year 
telecommunications was up in and its only real strength was a increase in the fourth quarter of national auto  the second largest segment  was up slightly 
entertainment  computers  airlines and travel were soft 
pharmaceuticals  a relatively small segment  was up 
during  we expect advertising revenue to grow in the mid single digits  with half of this increase coming from core business and the other half from new initiatives 
we expect national and classified revenue to be somewhat stronger than retail revenue 
retail revenue is generally healthy  with the exception of department stores 
national revenue continues to be solid 
classified revenue assumes some rebound in auto revenue and sustained strength in employment and real estate revenue 
in recent years  many newspapers nationwide have experienced declines in circulation copies 
increased competition  particularly from the internet  has caused the decline in copies 
we have increased discounting as a primary tactic to grow circulation  which caused our revenue to decline 
nevertheless  growing both circulation copies and growing revenue remains a challenge to our industry and us 
our plans for the coming year include telemarketing and selective discounting  along with increased use of crew sales  kiosks  single copy insert coupons and direct mail promotions 
telemarketing rules adopted by the federal trade commission and federal communications commission  including the national do not call registry and regulations  have had an impact on our ability to source subscriptions through telemarketing  but we have expanded our use of other sources of new subscribers to offset much of that impact 
there are two favorable factors a not everyone elected to be included on the register  and b our newspapers will still be able to contact persons with whom they have an established business relationship or from whom they obtained express consent 
in response to the economic downturn  newspapers have focused attention on cost reduction 
in  we implemented a work force reduction program 
in  we launched an operations task force to identify savings that could be applied companywide 
the task force teams investigated opportunities for cost reductions throughout the company in content  production  technology  people  administration  vendor 
table of contents management  smaller papers and circulation 
we began implementing their recommendations in to date  we have realized incremental savings of more than million 
in  overall operating costs were up  due to a rise in newsprint  ink and supplement costs and a increase in labor and employee benefits 
ftes were down in  following declines of and in and  respectively 
for the coming year  we anticipate increases in newsprint and benefits primarily pension and postretirement benefits in the low double digits 
during  we expect health care costs to be up and we anticipate an increase in pension costs due to a lower discount rate 
ftes should be down about  despite additions for various revenue task force initiatives 
during  we expect the price of newsprint to rise in the low double digits  but we expect the newsprint  ink and supplements line will increase only in the high single digits due to decreases in consumption and lower increases in ink and supplements 
our online segment performed very well in revenue of million was up and operating income of million was up from krd unique visitors averaged million per month  up 
the strong results reflect increases in all of krd s revenue streams 
krd management is focused on growing revenue  expanding product offerings  managing costs and increasing unique visitors 
the team is also focused on maximizing the benefit of the recent aol and msn traffic agreements with careerbuilder 
we project a solid trajectory of growth for online in we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to adjust the mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
our weighted average cost of debt  including the benefit of swaps  was at the end of fiscal our debt balance increased by million from billion in to billion in losses from investees decreased over the past year and we expect further improvement in as the price per ton of newsprint is projected to increase  benefiting our newsprint mill investees 
our effective tax rate was lower in than in  mainly due to the favorable resolution of tax matters from prior years 
we anticipate our effective tax rate to be in the to range in our shares outstanding decreased in  the result of our continued commitment to allocate free cash flow to share repurchases 
our businesses continue to provide sufficient cash for our operations and capital expenditures 
moreover  we intend to use future cash flow for the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares  as well as strategic acquisitions

overall operating costs in rose just  with ftes down for the year 
the price per ton of newsprint was up over the previous year  less than anticipated and reflecting our implementation of lighter weight newsprint across most of our newspapers 
in addition  we benefited from reduced interest expense and lower weighted average shares outstanding

fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee

the recognition provisions of fin are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have certain existing guarantees that when modified will require us to record a liability on our balance sheet for the fair market value of the guarantee

which provides guidance on how companies should account for the impact of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act on its postretirement health care plans 
to encourage employers to retain or provide postretirement drug benefits  beginning in the federal government will provide non taxable subsidy payments to employers that sponsor prescription drug benefits to retirees that are actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit 
although formal guidance in determining actuarial equivalence has not been provided  we expect that our prescription drug plan will qualify for the government subsidy 
effective july   knight ridder prospectively adopted fsp adoption of fsp reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million and resulted in an unrecognized actuarial gain of a similar amount 
the unrecognized actuarial gain will be amortized over the estimated expected service life of the participants 
adoption resulted in a  reduction in postretirement benefits cost for the two fiscal quarters ended december  on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for public entities excluding small business issuers in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june   irrespective of the entity s fiscal year 
early adoption is permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
sfas r allows for two transition alternatives for public companies a modified prospective transition or b modified retrospective transition 
under the modified prospective transition method  companies are required to recognize compensation cost for share based payments to employees based on their grant date fair value from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied 
measurement and attribution of compensation cost for awards that were granted prior to  but not vested as of the date sfas r is adopted would be based on the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used previously under sfas either for financial statement recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes 
prior periods are not restated 
for periods prior to adoption  the financial statements are unchanged and the pro forma disclosures previously required by sfas continue to be required under the new standard to the extent those amounts differ from those in the income statement 
for periods subsequent to adoption  the impact of this transition method generally is the same as if the modified retrospective method were applied 
accordingly  pro forma disclosure will not be necessary for periods after the adoption of the new standard 
under the modified retrospective transition method  companies are allowed to restate prior periods by recognizing compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosure under the provisions of sfas new awards and unvested awards would be accounted for in the same manner as the modified prospective method 
because of the mid year effective date  companies are permitted to apply the modified retrospective transition alternative either a to all periods presented or b to the start of the fiscal year in which sfas r is adopted 
we are currently evaluating the alternative transition methods and expect to adopt sfas r  as required  for our third quarter beginning june  had we adopted sfas in  our diluted earnings per share would have been lower 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk borrowings 
by balancing the mix of variable versus fixed rate borrowings  we manage the interest rate risk of our debt 
note debt on pages and of this report includes information related to the contractual interest rates and fair value of the individual borrowings 
at various times  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposure in order to achieve a desired proportion of variable rate versus 
table of contents fixed rate debt 
the fair value of the swaps at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
as of the end of fiscal  approximately of our borrowings were variable rate 
we do not trade or engage in hedging for speculative purposes and hedging activities are transacted only with highly rated financial institutions  reducing the exposure to credit risk 
a hypothetical basis point increase in libor would increase interest expense associated with variable rate borrowings by approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps by million in this change in fair value of debt obligations excludes commercial paper and other short term variable rate borrowings as changes in interest rates would not significantly affect the fair market value of these instruments 
newsprint 
we consumed approximately  metric tons of newsprint in  excluding detroit 
this represented of our total operating expenses 
under the caption newsprint on page of this report  we have included information on our suppliers  the long term purchase agreements used to manage the related risk of price increases  and natural hedges we have in place through our investment in newsprint mills 
we have also in the past entered into newsprint hedges to take advantage of market conditions and further manage the risk of price increases 
as of the end of fiscal  we do not have any outstanding newsprint hedges 
a hypothetical increase in newsprint costs would increase newsprint expense by approximately million 
our ownership in sp newsprint and ponderay provide a hedge against price volatility for approximately of our newsprint expense 
this million increase in newsprint costs would be partially offset by million in earnings from our newsprint mill investments  and would increase our earnings from equity investees on our consolidated statement of income 
therefore  our pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million
