table of contents results of operations the following summarizes the company s results of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and in millions  except per common share amounts growth results of operations years ended june  revenue operating earnings earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting net earnings net diluted earnings per common share growth is calculated as change increase or decrease for a given year as compared to immediately preceding year 
the results of operations during the fiscal years noted in the table above reflect the breadth of products and services the company offers and the increasing demand for the company s diverse portfolio of products and services  which led to revenue growth in every segment of the company 
the company continues to experience strong demand from health care providers for the company to provide integrated solutions 
integrated solutions include products and services from multiple lines of businesses within the company  and currently represent approximately billion of annual sales 
the company s operations are organized into four reportable segments  pharmaceutical distribution and provider services  medical products and services  pharmaceutical technologies and services and clinical technologies and services 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of changes to business segments during fiscal the company s pharmaceutical distribution business is in a business model transition with respect to how it is compensated for the logistical  capital and administrative services that it provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers 
historically  the compensation received by the pharmaceutical distribution business from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers was based on each manufacturer s unique sales practices eg  volume of product available for sale  eligibility to purchase product  cash discounts for prompt payment  rebates  etc 
and pharmaceutical pricing practices eg  the timing  frequency and magnitude of product price increases 
specifically  a significant portion of the compensation the pharmaceutical distribution business received from manufacturers was derived from the company s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in advance of pharmaceutical price increases  hold that inventory as manufacturers increased pharmaceutical prices  and generate a higher operating margin on the subsequent sale of that inventory 
this compensation system was dependent to a large degree upon the sales practices of each branded pharmaceutical manufacturer  including established policies concerning the volume of product available for purchase in advance of a price increase  and on predictable pharmaceutical pricing practices 
beginning in fiscal  branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control over the amount of pharmaceutical product available in the supply chain  and  as a result  began to change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers 
in addition  manufacturers have increasingly sought more services from the company  including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns 
the company believes that the manufacturers have sought these changes to provide them with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to  and distributed in  the secondary market 
these changes have significantly reduced the compensation received by the company from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers 
as a result of these actions by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers  the company concluded it was no longer being adequately and consistently compensated for the reliable and consistent logistical  capital and administrative services being provided by the company to these manufacturers 
in response to the developments discussed above  the company has established a compensation system that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers sales or pricing practices  and is based on the services provided by the company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each manufacturer s products 
during fiscal  the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee for service terms that adequately compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers 
the initial fee for service transition is essentially complete  which should help reduce earnings volatility in the segment 
as part of the transition to fee for service terms  certain of the new distribution service agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflation based compensation component to them 
arrangements with certain other branded manufacturers still continue to be solely inflation based 
if branded pharmaceutical price inflation is lower than the 
table of contents company has anticipated  its operating results could be adversely affected with respect to its current exposure to contingent fee based compensation in its pharmaceutical distribution business 
in addition  certain key distribution service agreements will be re negotiated in the latter half of fiscal and into fiscal when their initial terms expire 
if the terms of the re negotiated agreements are unfavorable to the company  it could adversely affect the company s operating results 
revenue and operating earnings within the pyxis products business of the clinical technologies and services segment declined significantly during fiscal the decline was a result of the following a lengthened sales and installation cycle  the delayed introduction of pyxis medstation  the next generation of pyxis medication management system  increased competition within the industry  and the impact from the audit committee s internal review  as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which created execution issues as the efforts and attention of certain sales and installation teams were diverted from ordinary business operations 
the company believes that these adverse conditions impacted the pyxis products business in the short term  and it remains confident in the long term prospects for this business due to the expected efficiencies from the formation of the clinical technologies and services segment  the greater efficiency to be realized from new installation processes and continuing customer demand for products and services focusing on patient safety 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the pyxis products business established momentum for fiscal as evidenced by its increased committed contracts primarily for its new product  pyxis medstation operating earnings within the company s pharmaceutical technologies and services segment declined during fiscal the decline was due in part to the continued delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities operating below planned capacity within the biotechnology and sterile life sciences business  including the humacao  puerto rico facility 
the company decided to close the sterile manufacturing facility in humacao  puerto rico as part of the global restructuring program associated with its one cardinal health initiative 
these operations had underperformed relative to company expectations  due in part to continued regulatory issues at the facility 
the decision does not affect the company s other operations in puerto rico or at other locations worldwide 
in addition  the operating earnings decline within this segment was also the result of lower demand for medical communication services within the healthcare marketing services business 
the adverse conditions experienced by the segment were partially offset by the strength of certain softgel and controlled release products  as well as the year over year impact of acquisitions 
global restructuring program as previously reported  during fiscal  the company launched a global restructuring program in connection with its one cardinal health initiative with the goal of increasing the value the company provides its customers through better integration of existing businesses and improved efficiency from a more disciplined approach to procurement and resource allocation 
the company expects the program to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal and to improve operating earnings and position the company for future growth 
the actual operating earnings improvements for fiscal were estimated by the company to have been in excess of the expected improvement of million 
the program is expected to improve operating earnings by approximately million for fiscal the company expects the program to be implemented in two phases 
the first phase of the program focuses on business consolidations and process improvements  including rationalizing facilities worldwide  reducing the company s global workforce  and rationalizing and discontinuing overlapping and under performing product lines 
see the form k filed by the company on december  for a description of the costs the company expects to incur in connection with the first phase of the program 
the second phase of the program will focus on longer term integration activities that will enhance service to customers through improved integration across the company s segments  and continue to streamline internal operations 
see the form k filed by the company on august  for a description of the costs the company expects to incur in connection with the second phase of the program 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the restructuring costs incurred by the company during fiscal related to both phases of the global restructuring program

the value of the transaction  including the assumption of alaris debt  totaled approximately billion 
for further information regarding the alaris acquisition  the valuation of the acquisition s intangibles  and the impact on segment reporting  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior to the completion of the alaris acquisition  on june   icu medical  inc filed a patent infringement lawsuit against alaris in the united states district court for the southern district of california 
in the lawsuit  icu claims that the alaris smartsite family of needle free values and systems infringes upon icu patents 
icu seeks monetary damages plus permanent injunctive relief preventing alaris from selling smartsite products 
on july   the court denied icu s application for a preliminary injunction finding  among other things  that icu had failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits 
the company intends to vigorously defend this action 
during december  the company completed its acquisition of intercare  an european pharmaceutical products and services company 
the cash transaction was valued at approximately million  including the assumption of approximately million in intercare debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact that this acquisition had on the company s segment reporting 
during fiscal  and  the company completed numerous acquisitions  including  alaris  intercare and syncor 
the company s trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry 
this trend has resulted in expansion into areas that complement the company s existing operations and provide opportunities for the company to develop synergies with  and strengthen  the acquired business 
as the health care industry continues to change  the company evaluates possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to take advantage of opportunities to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry through all its reporting segments 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully take advantage of any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction  if pursued 
to the extent that the company continues to pursue acquisitions  its ability to complete such transactions may be adversely affected by the government investigations described under part i  item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
if additional transactions are pursued or consummated  the company would incur additional merger and acquisition related costs  and may need to enter into funding arrangements for such mergers or acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 

table of contents results of operations the following sections provide additional detail regarding the results of operations of the company and  where applicable  the results of operations of the company s reportable segments 
revenue revenue for the company and its reportable segments are as follows for the fiscal year ended june  in millions pharmaceutical distribution and provider services pdps non bulk revenue bulk revenue total pdps medical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services clinical technologies and services corporate total company revenue see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of changes to business segments during fiscal see discussion below within the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services section for the company s definition of bulk revenue 
corporate revenue primarily consists of the elimination of intersegment revenue for all periods presented and foreign currency translation adjustments in fiscal and see footnote of note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the foreign currency translation adjustments 
the following table summarizes the revenue growth rates for the company and its reportable segments  as well as the percent of company revenue  excluding corporate  each segment represents percent of company growth revenue years ended june  pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services clinical technologies and services total company growth is calculated as change increase or decrease for a given year as compared to immediately preceding year 
total company 
total company revenue increased during each of fiscal and the revenue growth in these fiscal years resulted from the following a higher sales volume across each of the company s segments  revenue growth from existing customers  the addition of new customers  some of which resulted from new corporate arrangements with health care providers that integrate the company s diverse offerings  the addition of new products  pharmaceutical price increases within its pharmaceutical distribution business averaging approximately and  respectively  during fiscal and  and the year over year impact of acquisitions 

table of contents these increases during fiscal were partially offset by slower revenue growth within the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment and a decline in revenue from pyxis products within the clinical technologies and services segment 
pharmaceutical distribution and provider services 
the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services revenue growth of in fiscal resulted from strong sales to customers within this segment s core pharmaceutical distribution business 
the most significant growth was in bulk revenue defined below  which increased approximately 
see the bulk revenue discussion below for further details 
in addition  annualized pharmaceutical price increases of approximately contributed to the growth in this segment 
however  the rate of price increases was lower than the rate experienced over the prior fiscal year 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k  during fiscal  the company decided to aggregate revenue classes 
operating revenue and bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other were combined for all periods presented so that total revenue and total cost of products sold are presented as single amounts in the consolidated statements of earnings 
beginning with the form k  information concerning the portion of the company s revenue that arises from bulk revenue is discussed in the company s management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for more information regarding this reclassification  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment reports transactions with the following characteristics as bulk revenue deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products  delivery of products to the customer in the same bulk form as the products are received from the manufacturer  warehouse to customer warehouse or process center deliveries  or deliveries to customers in large or high volume full case quantities 
bulk revenue for fiscal was billion compared to billion in fiscal the increase in bulk revenue primarily relates to additional volume from existing and new customers as well as market growth within the mail order business 
the increase from existing customers is primarily due to certain customers purchasing from the company rather than directly from the manufacturer 
the company continues to provide disclosure concerning its bulk sales due to the differences in the nature and character of the business activities associated with bulk and non bulk revenues 
non bulk activities tend to be more complex as the company receives inventory in large or full case sizes from the manufacturer  breaks it down into smaller sizes  warehouses the product  picks products specific to a customer s order and delivers that order to customer locations such as retail pharmacies or individual hospitals generally on a just in time basis and in small sizes 
while certain of the above activities occur with some bulk transactions  bulk typically involves much larger sizes  generally in unopened cases or full pallets  which are shipped either directly from the manufacturer or from the company to customers own warehousing facilities 
the company s classification of sales as bulk or non bulk also corresponds to its four business operations within pharmaceutical distribution 
applying the definition set forth above  all revenue in the brokerage and trading operations is classified as bulk 
all revenue in the repackaging operation is classified as non bulk 
within the core facilities operation  revenue is classified as bulk or non bulk on a customer by customer basis  based solely upon the type of customer involved 
shipments to warehouses and processing centers primarily retail chain and mail order customers are classified as bulk revenue 
all other core facilities revenue is classified as non bulk revenue 
this segment s revenue growth of in fiscal resulted primarily from strong sales to existing customers  sales to new customers and pharmaceutical price increases 
sales growth to existing customers within the retail chain and alternate site categories in this segment s pharmaceutical distribution business showed particular strength 
this segment also benefited from contract wins during fiscal  pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately during fiscal and an extra business day 
these revenue gains were partially dampened by continued reduction in business with kmart holding corp 
kmart due to kmart s closure of various stores and certain contract losses during fiscal in this segment s pharmaceutical distribution business 
medical products and services 
the medical products and services revenue growth of in fiscal resulted primarily from increased volume from existing customers  new contracts signed during fiscal within the medical surgical distribution business  strong international growth  especially in canada and europe  favorable foreign exchange translation and increased revenue from the specialty distribution business 
the growth in the medical surgical distribution business was primarily from increased sales to hospital supply and ambulatory care customers and the growth within the specialty distribution business resulted from increased revenue from the business largest customer and growth of the existing customer base 
this segment s revenue growth was adversely affected by slower growth in the sale of self manufactured products  and the loss of certain business from customers within a gpo 
the specialty distribution business largest customer has notified the company that they will begin self distribution on january  which will significantly impact revenue and operating earnings for this business during the second half of fiscal this customer represented approximately billion or of this segment s fiscal revenue 
the company plans to partially mitigate this loss through the addition of a large  new customer agreement signed in april and cost cutting measures 
this segment s revenue growth of in fiscal resulted primarily from increased sales momentum from new and existing contracts within the distribution business as well as from increased sales volume from the segment s international businesses 
new contracts drove increased sales of both distributed and self manufactured products  with sales from the distribution business particularly strong during fiscal the international businesses also generated strong revenue growth  increasing nearly from the prior fiscal year 
approximately of the international business revenue growth related to 
table of contents changes in foreign currency rates 
sales of new self manufactured products  particularly enhancements within surgeon glove products  also contributed to the overall revenue growth 
this segment s revenue growth was above industry averages during fiscal pharmaceutical technologies and services 
the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment s revenue growth of in fiscal resulted primarily from strong demand for certain softgel products  the impact of acquisitions  primarily intercare and the acquisition of geodax within the nuclear pharmacy services business  and the impact of foreign exchange rates 
revenue growth was offset by certain regulatory issues as noted below 
the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures within this segment accounted for approximately of the revenue growth in fiscal revenue in fiscal increased by approximately as a result of the impact of foreign exchange rates 
this impact takes into consideration the fiscal rate fluctuations due to the weakening of the us dollar and the fiscal constant rate adjustment see footnote to the table in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion as it relates to fiscal constant rate adjustment 
the segment s growth was adversely affected by the continued delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities operating below planned capacity within the company s biotechnology and sterile life sciences business  including underperformance at the humacao  puerto rico facility 
the segment s growth was also adversely affected by lower demand for medical communication services within the healthcare marketing services business 
this segment s revenue growth of in fiscal resulted from acquisitions and sales momentum within the pharmaceutical development  nuclear pharmacy services and packaging services businesses 
approximately of this segment s revenue growth was due to the inclusion of intercare  an acquisition completed during december intercare s results of operations are not included in the prior period amounts 
intercare s operations had considerable sales momentum after the acquisition was completed  particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal also  this segment s revenue growth benefited from the inclusion of syncor  an acquisition that was completed on january  syncor s results of operations are not included in the amounts for the first half fiscal acquisitions within this segment accounted for approximately of the revenue growth during fiscal this segment s fiscal revenue growth was partially dampened by a delay in startup of commercial manufacturing of key sterile products from signed contracts as certain regulatory inspections and product approvals were delayed in the biotechnology and sterile life sciences business 
revenue growth was not impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations as the company applied constant exchange rates to translate its foreign operations revenue into us dollars 
the impact of actual foreign exchange rate changes for translation purposes is retained within the corporate segment see footnote of the table in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
clinical technologies and services 
the clinical technologies and services revenue growth of in fiscal resulted primarily from the impact of the acquisition of alaris and strong revenue growth within the clinical services and consulting business offset by significant revenue declines within the pyxis products business 
the alaris acquisition accounted for approximately of this segment s total revenue growth for fiscal alaris results of operations are not included in the prior period amounts 
the pyxis products business experienced a revenue decline of approximately in fiscal due to the following a lengthened sales and installation cycle  the delayed introduction of pyxis medstation  the next generation of pyxis medication management system  increased competition within the industry  and the impact from the audit committee s internal review  as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which created execution issues as the efforts and attention of certain sales and installation teams were diverted from ordinary business operations 
the company believes that these adverse conditions impacted the pyxis products business in the short term  and it remains confident in the long term prospects for this business due to the expected efficiencies from the formation of the clinical technologies and services segment  the greater efficiency to be realized from new installation processes and continuing customer demand for products and services focusing on patient safety 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the pyxis products business established momentum for fiscal as evidenced by its increased committed contracts primarily for its new product  pyxis medstation in fiscal  the pyxis products business sold portions of its leased asset portfolio at the direction of corporate 
the proceeds were transferred to corporate  and the pyxis products business subsequently received a million allocation from corporate related to the estimated interest income that would have been earned had the associated lease portfolios not been sold 
this allocation was recorded within revenue  consistent with the recording of interest income received from sales type leases 
effective the first quarter of fiscal  the pyxis products business did not receive this corporate allocation 
see footnote to the table in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 

table of contents the clinical technologies and services segment s revenue growth of in fiscal is reflective of the premature revenue recognition adjustment resulting from the audit committee s internal review as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operationally  this segment s revenue growth in fiscal included sales growth within the medication product lines such as the pyxis medstation system  the addition of new products and growth within the clinical services and consulting business 
this segment was adversely affected by a softening of demand at the hospital level for pyxis products 
as discussed above  in order to aid in the comparability of this segment s operating results  during fiscal  the company recorded a corporate allocation adjustment to this segment s revenue of million representing an estimate of interest income this segment would have earned had the company not completed sales of its lease receivables 
operating earnings operating earnings for the company and its reportable segments are as follows for the fiscal year ended june  in millions pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services clinical technologies and services corporate total company operating earnings see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of changes to business segments during fiscal the cost of the company s shared service center in albuquerque new mexico  which was previously reported within the corporate segment  has been classified within the medical products and services operating earnings for fiscal and to more accurately reflect the costs within the segment which received the benefits from the shared service center 
the cost of these services was approximately million  million and million  respectively  for fiscal  and corporate operating earnings primarily include special items  impairment charges  investment spending and unallocated corporate administrative expenses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of corporate operating earnings 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company will modify the way in which corporate costs are allocated to the business segments to better align corporate spending with the business segments based on the benefits received 
the presentation of the first quarter of fiscal results will include a re allocation of the historical segment amounts for comparative purposes 
the following table summarizes the operating earnings growth rates for the company and its reportable segments  as well as the percent of company operating earnings  excluding corporate  each segment represents percent of company growth operating earnings years ended june  pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services clinical technologies and services total company growth is calculated as change increase or decrease for a given year as compared to immediately preceding year

special items and impairment charges are not allocated to the segments 

table of contents see notes and in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s special items and impairment charges 
total company operating earnings decreased and increased during fiscal and  respectively 
the following paragraphs provide a description of the varying dynamics affecting the total company s operating earnings for fiscal and total company 
total company operating earnings decreased during fiscal as a result of declining operating earnings in each of the company s reportable segments 
the company s gross margins were dampened primarily by the following reduced vendor margins within the pharmaceutical distribution business driven primarily by changes in branded pharmaceutical manufacturers sales and pricing practices see the overview section for further discussion and competitive pricing  increased mix of lower margin distribution business  competitive pricing and increased raw material and fuel costs within the medical products and services segment  continued regulatory issues adversely affecting manufacturing efficiencies within the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment  and a lengthened sales and installation cycle  new product launch delays and increased competition within the pyxis products business in the clinical technologies and services segment 
total company operating earnings were also adversely affected by the unfavorable impact related to special items of million in fiscal these increased costs related to the company s global restructuring program associated with its one cardinal health initiative  the sec investigation and audit committee internal review and related matters and the integration of certain acquisitions  which were partially offset by settlements received in antitrust and vitamin litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in addition  the company recorded million for asset impairments during fiscal compared to gains of million in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
total company operating earnings for fiscal were also impacted by the following the favorable impact of approximately million from changes in the lifo reserve  primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories  lower inventory levels and lower price increases related to branded pharmaceutical inventories  an increase in profit sharing expense of approximately million compared to fiscal  an increase in incentive compensation expense of approximately million compared to fiscal  expenses of approximately million within the medical products and services segment related to the estimated remaining liabilities and settlement of insurance proceeds due for outstanding latex litigation  purchase accounting adjustments related to the alaris acquisition  which included an inventory valuation adjustment to fair value  and the adjusted  higher cost inventory being sold  adversely affecting gross margins by approximately million  product line rationalization and inventory and accounts receivable reserve adjustments within the pyxis products business of approximately million  an increase in inventory reserves within the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment of approximately million related to a generic manufacturer s bankruptcy and million related to slow moving inventory  and an increase in audit and audit related fees of approximately million compared to fiscal due to increased costs associated with complying with the sarbanes oxley act of  expanded audit procedures and a revision in the allocation of audit and audit related fees to fiscal periods 
total company operating earnings increased during fiscal primarily as a result of the company s revenue growth of during the same time period  which yielded a gross margin increase of 
gross margins grew at a slower rate than revenue primarily as a result of the following the continued dampening effect of reduced vendor margins and competitive pricing within the pharmaceutical distribution business driven by changes to its business model see the overview section for further discussion  an increased mix of lower margin distribution business within the medical products and services segment  an increased mix of lower margin business  primarily nuclear pharmacy services business  within the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment  and competitive product and pricing actions within the clinical technologies and services segment 

table of contents the overall increase in gross margin in fiscal reflects the increased contributions from the company s operating segments outside of the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment  which generate higher gross margins and operating earnings as a percentage of revenue 
these segments accounted for more than one half of the company s operating earnings 
acquisitions completed by the company accounted for approximately of the operating earnings growth 
the increases in revenue and gross margin were partially offset by a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal as well as an increase of million in the company s special items 
the overall increase in operating expenses was primarily a result of the additional expenses resulting from acquisitions  higher personnel costs associated with overall business growth and an increase in depreciation and amortization costs 
additionally  the company continued to invest in research and development and strategic initiatives that will benefit future periods 
investments of approximately million in fiscal were charged against current operating earnings as incurred 
these increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were offset partially by a reduction versus the prior fiscal year in incentive compensation expenses of approximately million due to the performance of the company s consolidated operations relative to management s expectations and established financial performance metrics 
such reduction affected all of the company s business segments 
the expense increases were also offset by adjustments of certain trade receivable reserves and lower bad debt expenses  with a combined impact of approximately million  due to changes in customer specific credit exposures and improvements in customer credit  billing and collection processes yielding significant reductions in past due and uncollectible accounts 
in addition  operating earnings included million of net gains on the sale of certain businesses and assets which were recorded in impairment charges and other 
pharmaceutical distribution and provider services 
the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services operating earnings decreased during fiscal primarily as a result of reduced vendor margins resulting from changes in branded pharmaceutical manufacturers sales and pricing practices  as discussed above in the overview section  and competitive pricing pressures 
as discussed above  branded pharmaceutical manufacturers have changed their sales practices by restricting product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers 
in addition  branded pharmaceutical manufacturers product pricing practices have become less predictable  as the frequency of price increases has slowed and the amounts have decreased versus historical levels 
for fiscal  annualized pharmaceutical price increases were approximately compared to in fiscal during fiscal  the company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee for service terms that adequately compensate the company based on the services being provided to such manufacturers 
the initial fee for service transition is essentially complete  which should help reduce earnings volatility in the segment 
this segment s operating earnings were also favorably impacted by million from changes in the lifo reserve primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical inventories  lower inventory levels and lower price increases related to branded pharmaceutical inventories 
operating earnings were also impacted by improved margins from generic products and expense control within the pharmaceutical distribution business which resulted in lowering selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
in addition  operating earnings during fiscal were adversely impacted by approximately million for inventory reserves related to a generic manufacturer s bankruptcy  approximately million related to slow moving inventory reserves and approximately million as a result of inventory rationalization of certain health and beauty care products 
this segment s operating earnings decreased during fiscal primarily due to reduced vendor margins caused by the changing business model within the pharmaceutical distribution business as further described in the overview section and the impact of competitive pricing 
other adjustments within the pharmaceutical distribution business that negatively impacted this segment in fiscal included an increase in inventory valuation and vendor dispute reserves in the fourth quarter of approximately million and an adverse adjustment in the third quarter of approximately million for vendor margins 
in addition  one of several aspects of the business model transition adversely impacting pharmaceutical distribution s year over year operating earnings was the change in estimation of vendor margin with generic  health and beauty products and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an impact of approximately million 
these declines were partially offset by the following segment revenue growth of coupled with expense control  a change in accounting for cash discounts resulting in additional gross margin of million in fiscal see additional discussion of the accounting change in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  a favorable year over year impact of million from changes in lifo reserve  a favorable year over year impact of lower incentive compensation expense  a favorable year over year impact of certain non recurring expenses recorded in fiscal relating to operations from the bindley acquisition  and a favorable year over year impact of million charge recorded in fiscal relating to the segment s vendor margins with its generic suppliers 

table of contents medical products and services 
the medical products and services segment s operating earnings decreased during fiscal primarily as a result of pricing pressures related to self manufactured products  increased raw material and fuel costs  an increased mix of lower margin distributed products  and competitive pricing on a large gpo contract 
operating earnings were also adversely impacted by a million charge for latex litigation as more fully described within note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses grew during fiscal primarily due to the charge for latex litigation described above and higher personnel costs associated with the overall business growth 
these items were partially offset by revenue growth of  manufacturing efficiencies  expense control related to the company s global restructuring program and incremental operating earnings from new customers 
this segment s operating earnings growth of during fiscal resulted primarily from revenue growth of during the same time period  led by sales momentum from distribution contracts and gains within international markets 
this segment also realized manufacturing productivity improvements resulting in gross margin gains 
in addition  operating earnings benefited from lower incentive compensation expense versus prior year 
this segment s operating earnings growth was partially dampened by the increased mix of lower margin distributed products  competitive pricing within the industry and an increase of approximately million in raw material prices 
pharmaceutical technologies and services 
the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment s operating earnings decreased during fiscal primarily due to the continued delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities operating below planned capacity within the company s biotechnology and sterile life sciences business  including underperformance at the humacao  puerto rico facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to close the sterile manufacturing facility in humacao  puerto rico as part of its global restructuring program 
these operations had underperformed relative to company expectations  due in part to continued regulatory issues at the facility 
the decision does not affect the company s other operations in puerto rico or at other locations worldwide 
in addition  the operating earnings in this segment s healthcare marketing services business were adversely affected by lower demand for medical communication services 
operating earnings were also adversely impacted by approximately million related to the write down of inventory within the biotechnology and sterile life sciences business 
the operating earnings declines were partially offset by the strength of certain softgel and controlled release products  and the year over year impact of acquisitions of approximately 
the impact of foreign exchange rates on operating earnings did not significantly affect the fiscal growth rates above 
this takes into consideration the fiscal rate fluctuations due to the weakening of the us dollar and the fiscal constant rate adjustment 
see footnote to the table in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion as it relates to the fiscal constant rate adjustment and the change made in fiscal this segment s operating earnings growth of during fiscal resulted primarily from revenue growth of during the same time period  with sales momentum in the pharmaceutical development  nuclear pharmacy services and packaging services businesses showing particular strength 
this segment also benefited from acquisitions completed by the company  specifically intercare and syncor 
the acquisition of intercare was completed during the second quarter fiscal and  therefore  its results of operations are not included in the prior period 
also  syncor s results of operations are not included in the first half of fiscal because the acquisition was completed on january  acquisitions within this segment accounted for approximately of the operating earnings growth during fiscal this segment s gross margin as a percentage of revenue was negatively impacted by the increase in services provided by the nuclear pharmacy services business  which has a lower gross margin ratio as compared to the other businesses within this segment 
the segment s operating earnings also benefited year over year by reduced incentive compensation expenses 
operating earnings growth was dampened by the delay in startup of commercial manufacturing of certain sterile products as discussed in this segment s revenue discussion 
in addition  this segment s fiscal operating earnings growth was not impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations as the company applied constant exchange rates to translate its foreign operations operating earnings into us dollars 
the impact of actual foreign exchange rate changes for translation purposes was retained within the corporate segment in fiscal see footnote to the table in note in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion as it relates to the fiscal constant rate adjustment and the change made in fiscal 
table of contents clinical technologies and services 
the clinical technologies and services segment s operating earnings decreased during fiscal primarily from decreased operating earnings within the pyxis products business that were not completely offset by the acquisition benefit from the alaris transaction 
the pyxis products business performance was impacted by decreased revenue of for fiscal  lower unit margins due to adverse year over year sales mix  more aggressive price discounting in the market place 
a product line rationalization and inventory and accounts receivable reserve adjustments of approximately million  and the positive segment allocation adjustments recorded during fiscal of million for the estimated interest income that the business would have earned from assets sold as part of the leased asset portfolio sales which proceeds from such sales were returned to corporate for general corporate requirements 
the alaris acquisition improved operating earnings by approximately for fiscal the results of operations from this acquisition are not included in the prior period amounts 
operating results from alaris  while incremental to the segment s results year over year  were adversely impacted by the effect of purchase accounting adjustments recorded during the first two quarters of fiscal these adjustments included an inventory valuation adjustment to fair value and the adjusted  higher cost inventory being sold  which adversely affected gross margins by approximately million 
this segment s operating earnings growth of during fiscal was impacted by the premature revenue recognition adjustment resulting from the audit committee s internal review as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this segment s operating earnings growth during fiscal resulted  in part  from this segment s revenue growth of during the same time period in conjunction with operational improvements within the pyxis products business and expense control within the clinical services and consulting business 
in addition  this segment benefited from a reduction in receivable reserves and lower bad debt expenses  with a combined impact of approximately million  due to improvements in customer specific credit matters and general improvements in customer credit  billing and collection procedures  resulting in significant reductions in past due and uncollectible accounts 
the segment s fiscal operating earnings also benefited year over year from reduced incentive compensation expenses and a corporate expense allocation of million 
as mentioned in this segment s revenue discussion  the company recorded  for comparative purposes  a corporate allocation of million to this segment representing estimated interest income this segment would have earned had the company not initiated the sale of its lease receivables

the company manages its exposure to interest rates using various hedging strategies see notes and in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the million increase in interest expense during fiscal was partially offset by the company recording the minority interest impact of approximately million for certain impairment charges within the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment s oral technologies business 
these impairment charges were recorded within impairment charges and other on the consolidated statements of earnings during fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding impairment charges and other 
the increase in interest expense and other of million during fiscal resulted primarily from the adverse year over year impact of foreign exchange rates and the impact of a gain recognized in fiscal related to a speculative interest rate swap transaction  which were partially offset by decreased interest expense 
provision for income taxes the provisions for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of changes in accounting were of pretax earnings in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal year includes tax expense related to a planned repatriation of foreign earnings as provided for in the american jobs creation act of the ajca see the following paragraph 
generally  fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within state and foreign effective tax rates resulting from the company s business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items  which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item and the taxing jurisdiction 
the company s effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from increasing operations outside the united states  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 
the company has subsidiaries operating in puerto rico under a tax incentive agreement expiring in  as well as a tax agreement in place with thailand that expires in on october   the ajca was signed into law 
a provision of the ajca creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that it will repatriate million of accumulated foreign earnings in fiscal pursuant to the repatriation provisions of the ajca  and accordingly has recorded a related tax liability of million as of june  the million is the maximum repatriation available to the company under the repatriation provisions of the ajca

critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are amounts owed to the company through its operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company also provides financing to various customers 
such financing arrangements range from one to ten years at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation 
these financings may be collateralized  guaranteed by third parties or unsecured 
finance notes and accrued interest receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets 
extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts involve the use of judgment by the company s management 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes general and specific reserves  the company reviews accounts receivable agings  industry trends  customer financial strength  credit standing  historical write off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection 
the company continuously monitors the collectibility of its receivable portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable  assessing credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks 
if the frequency or severity of customer defaults increases due to changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions  the company s allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment 

table of contents the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of customer receivables was and at june  and  respectively 
the decrease was a result of adjustments to certain trade receivable reserves due to changes in customer specific credit exposures  historical write off trends  and improvements in customer credit  billing and collections processes 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables to the fiscal reserve would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately million 
the company believes the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal year are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed 
the total reserve at june  and exceeds the total company receivable balance greater than days past due at those same dates 
see schedule ii included in this form k which includes a rollforward of activity for these allowance reserves 
inventories 
a substantial portion of inventories approximately in and in are stated at the lower of cost  using the lifo method  or market 
these inventories are included within the core distribution facilities within the company s pharmaceutical distribution business and are primarily merchandise inventories 
the remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
if the company had used the fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have increased million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
below is a reconciliation of fifo inventory to lifo inventory june  in millions fifo inventory lifo reserve valuation total inventory inventories recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
the company reserves for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experiences  sales trends  specific categories of inventory and age of on hand inventory 
if actual conditions are less favorable than the company s assumptions  additional inventory reserves may be required  however these would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
goodwill 
the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist 
accordingly  the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks  continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in conducting the impairment test  the fair value of the company s reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  then no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  further analysis is performed to assess impairment 
the company s impairment analysis is based on a review of the price earnings ratio for publicly traded companies similar in nature  scope and size or a discounted cash flow analysis 
the use of alternative estimates  peer groups or changes in the industry could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment 
any identified impairment would result in adjustment to the company s results of operations 
the company performed its annual impairment tests in fiscal and  neither of which resulted in the recognition of any impairment charges 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill 
business combinations 
assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which require management to use significant judgment in determining fair value 
the company typically utilizes third party valuation experts valuation experts for this process 
in addition  current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles  excluding goodwill 
the company believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
in conjunction with the review of a transaction  the valuation experts assess the status of the acquired company s research and development projects to determine the existence of in process research and development ipr d 
the company has not historically recorded significant costs related to ipr d 
however  in conjunction with the acquisition of alaris  the company was 
table of contents required to estimate the fair value of acquired ipr d which required selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project 
management also assessed the current status of development  nature and timing of efforts to complete such development  uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value 
costs were not assigned to ipr d unless future development was probable 
once the fair value was determined  an asset was established and  as required by gaap immediately written off as a special item in the company s consolidated statement of earnings 
the company recorded million as a special item in fiscal representing an estimate of alaris ipr d see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
special items 
the company s special items consist primarily of costs that relate to the integration of previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring operations to improve productivity 
integration costs from acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method have been recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
certain costs related to these acquisitions  such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs  were recognized at the date the integration plan was adopted by management 
certain other integration costs that did not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date have been expensed as the integration plan has been implemented 
the costs associated with integrating acquired companies under the purchase method are recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
certain costs to be incurred by the company  as the acquirer  such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs  are recognized at the date the integration plan is committed to and adopted by management 
certain other integration costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as the integration plan is implemented 
at the beginning of the third quarter fiscal  the company implemented sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  to account for costs incurred in restructuring activities 
under this standard  a liability for most types of exit costs is recognized as incurred 
as discussed above  the company previously accounted for costs associated with restructuring activities under eitf issue no 
 which required the company to recognize a liability for restructuring costs on the date of the commitment to an exit plan 
the majority of the special items related to acquisitions and restructurings can be classified in one of the following categories employee related costs  exit costs including lease termination costs  asset impairments and other integration costs 
employee costs include severance and termination benefits 
lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees  forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income 
other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility 
asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of the company s assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities

vendor reserves 
in determining an appropriate vendor reserve  the company assesses historical experience and current outstanding claims 
the company researches and resolves contested transactions based on discussions with vendors  company policy and findings of research performed 
at any given time  there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution 
the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the company s original estimate and may require adjustment 
however  the company believes reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
income tax reserves 
the company has established an estimated liability for federal  state and foreign income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
this liability addresses a number of issues for which the company may have to pay additional taxes and interest when all examinations by taxing authorities are concluded 
the company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period 
the liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances  a thorough research of the technical merits of the company s arguments  and an assessment of the probability of the company prevailing in its arguments 
in all cases  the company considers previous findings of the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
the company generally consults with external tax advisers in reaching its 
table of contents conclusions 
amounts accrued for a particular period are not adjusted upward or downward unless a significant change in facts or circumstances has occurred and been formally documented 
loss contingencies 
the company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires the company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the settlement can be reasonably estimated 
assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
the company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures 
the amount of ultimate settlement may differ from these estimates 
self insurance accruals 
the company is self insured for employee medical and dental insurance programs 
the company had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for estimated costs related to outstanding claims at june  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  administrative fees and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on the company s assessment of outstanding claims  historical analysis and current payment trends 
the company records an estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period 
this lag period assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented 
if the lag period was hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month  the impact on earnings would be million 
however  the company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
the company has certain deductibles or is self insured for various claims including general liability  product  pharmacist professional  auto and workers compensation 
the company had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for anticipated costs related to general liability and workers compensation at june  and  respectively 
these costs include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on the company s assessment of outstanding claims  historical analysis  actuarial information and current payment trends 
the amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters may differ from these estimates
