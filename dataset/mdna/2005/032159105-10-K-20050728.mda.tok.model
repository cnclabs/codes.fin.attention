item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction for a description of the company s business  refer to item i of part i of this annual report on form k 
as indicated in item i  the company is primarily engaged in three business segments the real estate business operated by amrep southwest and the fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services businesses operated by kable 
data concerning industry segments is set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s foreign sales and activities are not significant 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references in this item to  and mean the fiscal years ended april   and critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of those financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include i the determination of revenue recognition for the magazine distribution services business  which is based on estimates of allowances for magazine returns  ii allowances for doubtful accounts  iii real estate cost of sales calculations  which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete  iv cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets and assets held for sale  v pension plan accounting  and vi legal contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
certain of the most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates are based on the following considerations i distribution revenues represent commissions earned from the distribution of publications for client publishers which are recorded at the time the publications go on sale  however  since such publications are generally sold on a fully returnable basis  management also provides for estimated returns by charges to income which are determined on an issue by issue basis utilizing sales information and other relevant data  including publisher and like title history  ii management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by attempting to identify troubled accounts by analyzing the credit risk of specific customers and by using historical experience applied to the aging of accounts and  where appropriate within the real estate business  by reviewing any collateral which may secure a receivable  iii real estate development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project  and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies  but not yet incurred  iv asset impairment determinations including that of goodwill are based upon the intended use of assets and expected future cash flows  v pension plan accounting and disclosure is based upon numerous assumptions and estimates  including the expected rate of investment return on retirement plan assets  the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities the discount rate  and certain employee related factors such as turnover  retirement age and mortality  and vi the company is currently involved in one significant legal proceeding  which is described in item of this annual report on form k and which could have a material adverse effect if decided against the company  and several routine matters 
the legal proceeding described in item is not expected to come to trial before calendar it is possible that the consolidated financial position or results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an outcome of this litigation that is significantly different from the judgments made in connection with preparing the accompanying financial statements 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  results of operations as discussed in more detail below  the company began accounting for its water utility subsidiary as a discontinued operation in the quarter ended january  accordingly  financial information from prior periods has been reclassified to conform to this presentation

the decline in fulfillment services revenues was anticipated and largely attributable to customer losses at kable s colorado fulfillment business which had been identified and known prior to kable s acquisition of that business in  while the increase in revenues of newsstand distribution services resulted from additional business obtained in connection with kable s purchase of certain distribution contracts in the third quarter of kable s total operating expenses decreased in compared to  with the operating expenses of fulfillment services decreasing compared to the prior year due in part to decreases in payroll and other variable expenses resulting from the revenue decrease  reduced third party charges for outsourced computer processing and the inclusion in the prior year of approximately  of costs of relocating and centralizing certain fulfillment operations

real estate commissions and selling expenses increased as a percentage of related revenues  from in to in  due to the closing of a higher mix of land sales in without the involvement of a broker 
such costs generally vary depending upon the terms of specific land sale transactions

the credit arrangement requires the maintenance or achievement of certain financial ratios and contains certain financial restrictions  the most significant of which limit the amount of dividends and other payments that may be made by kable to its parent or other affiliates  as well as capital expenditures and other borrowings

the balance of inventory principally consisted of properties in colorado and  in  florida 
receivables from the company s magazine service operations increased from  at april  to  at april  due in part to the purchase of additional distribution contracts in as well as the timing of billings and payments 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased from  at april  to  at april  primarily as a result of the inclusion of the  deposit received in connection with the condemnation of the utility included in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows as well as  to a lesser extent  an increase in kable s publishers accounts payable reflecting the increase in receivables from magazine service operations 
the company s unfunded pension liability under its defined benefit retirement plan increased from  at april  to  at april   principally due to an increase in plan liabilities resulting from a change in the discount rate used in actuarial calculations from to

the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no

in the year of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating these transition methods  and does not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations  however  the total expense recorded in future periods will depend on several variables  including the number of share based awards that vest and the fair value of those vested awards 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb no 
sfas no 

the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principal that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
this standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after july  the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
segment information information by industry segment is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this information has been prepared in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related disclosures  which requires that industry segment information be prepared in a manner consistent with the manner in which financial information is prepared and evaluated by management for making operating decisions 
a number of assumptions and estimations are required to be made in the determination of segment data  including the need to make certain allocations of common costs and expenses among segments 
on an annual basis  management has evaluated the basis upon which costs are allocated  and has periodically made revisions to these methods of allocation 
accordingly  the determination of pretax income loss contribution of each segment as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements is presented for informational purposes  and is not necessarily the amount that would be reported if the segment were an independent company 
impact of inflation operations of the company can be impacted by inflation 
within the industries in which the company operates  inflation can cause increases in the cost of materials  services  interest and labor 
unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies  operating margins will decrease 
within the land development industry  the company encounters particular risks 
a large part of the company s real estate sales are to homebuilders who face their own inflationary concern that rising housing costs  including interest costs  may substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to finance the purchase of a new home or sell their existing home 
if this situation were to exist  the demand for the company s land by these homebuilder customers could decrease 
in general  in recent years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s markets  and as a result the company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in its real estate or magazine operations businesses
