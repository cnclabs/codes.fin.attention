item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors 
our fiscal year begins on april and ends on march references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  and references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  overview we are a designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensor based consumer products 
we produce a wide variety of sensors that use advanced technologies to measure precise ranges of physical characteristics including pressure  position  force  vibration  humidity and photo optics 
we have two segments  the sensor and consumer products 
our sensor segment designs and manufactures sensors for original equipment manufacturers 
these sensors are used for automotive  medical  consumer  military aerospace and industrial applications 
our sensor products include pressure and electromagnetic displacement sensors  piezoelectric polymer film sensors  panel sensors  custom microstructures  load cells  accelerometers  optical sensors and humidity sensors 
our consumer products segment designs and manufactures sensor based consumer products that we sell to original equipment manufacturers  retailers and distributors in both the united states and europe 
consumer products include bathroom and kitchen scales  tire pressure gauges and distance estimators 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended march  net sales sensors consumer products total net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses income selling  general  and administrative non cash compensation litigation expense research and development customer funded development amortization of acquired intangibles restructuring costs interest expense  net other expenses income income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit expense loss from operations of discontinued units gain on disposition of discontinued units net income loss executive summary measurement specialties has seen a significant amount of change over the last several years 
in may  we embarked upon an aggressive restructuring effort to improve the operating performance of the company 
a key component of this restructuring was the elimination of underutilized facilities to consolidate our operations in shenzhen  china and hampton  virginia 
having completed this restructuring  measurement specialties is now a global sensor solutions company with a broad range of technologies and capabilities 
in fiscal year  the company embarked on an ambitious growth strategy for the sensor division  to be achieved through acquisition and organic growth 
the result was six acquisitions during fy elekon industries  inc  entran devices  inc 
and entran sa  encoder devices  llc  humirel sa  mws sensorik gmbh  and polaron components ltd 
the acquisitions see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our focus remains engineered solutions where we can use our engineering and manufacturing talent and depth of knowledge and experience in sensors to provide a complete solution to our customers 
we also have a substantial end user business for high quality off the shelf sensors and transducers used for test  instrumentation and process control 
a key to our manufacturing strategy is leveraging the significant infrastructure we now have in shenzhen  china 
this infrastructure has enabled us to reduce costs and improve financial performance while continuing to provide our customers with low cost  highly reliable products 
our strategy development strategy 
we focus our development efforts in both our sensor business and consumer products business on the original equipment manufacturers oem market 
in the consumer products business  having both a branded and oem consumer scale business created some channel conflicts historically 
as part of this focus  we sold certain assets associated with our thinner r branded bathroom and kitchen scale business to conair corporation on january  we previously sold our thinner r branded scales directly to retailers  predominantly in the us and canada 
on a going forward basis  we expect to supply these scales directly to conair and intend to continue our efforts in the design  development and manufacture of innovative scale products for sale to our worldwide base of oem customers 
although our development focus is on the oem market  we intend to continue to develop and manufacture our tire pressure gauges  which are sold directly to retail customers under the accutire r brand 
as oem margins have historically been lower than margins on sales to retail customers  we expect our consumer products segment margins will decline as a result of this transaction 
growth strategy 
we are focused on aggressively growing our sensor segment 
we expect that this growth will come through a combination of organic growth and the acquisition of sensor businesses 
to that end  since march   the company has made six acquisitions referenced above 
to finance the acquisitions  we entered into an expanded million credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
to finance additional acquisitions  we would consider additional borrowings  the sale of equity securities  or the sale of existing company assets  including assets in our consumer products segment 
the results of operations of these acquisitions are included in our consolidated statement of operations as of and since their respective dates of purchase 
establishment of offshore holding companies 
in the quarter ended june   the company reorganized its asian operations under an offshore holding company  kenabell holding limited  a british virgin island company kenabell holding bvi 
as part of the reorganization  a new entity was formed under kenabell holding bvi in the cayman islands  measurement limited ml cayman 
a significant portion of the consumer business in asia was transferred into ml cayman during the quarter ended june  these holding companies were formed as part of a foreign tax planning restructuring  and to facilitate any potential future sale of assets of our consumer products business 
msi sensors asia limited formerly named measurement limited  organized in hong kong owns all of the shares of msi sensors china ltd 
formerly named jingliang electronics shenzhen co 
ltd  organized in the peoples republic of china 
kenabell holding bvi owns all of the shares of msi sensors asia limited and ml cayman 
all the companies are included in the consolidated financial statements of the group 
in the quarter ended march  as part of a foreign tax planning restructuring  the company completed the reorganization of its european subsidiaries  which includes entran sa and humirel sa 
this reorganization involved transferring ownership of these subsidiaries to a cyprus holding company under kenabell holding bvi  named acalon holding limited 
in conjunction with this reorganization  the ownership of kenabell holding bvi was also transferred to measurement specialties foreign holdings corporation  a delaware corporation 
trends 
sensor business the sensors market is highly fragmented with hundreds of niche players 
while the worldwide sensors market that we serve is expected to have a compound annual growth rate cagr  we expect to gain share and grow our sensor business in excess of the market 
as a result of this growth strategy  we anticipate pursuing high volume sensor business that will carry lower gross margins than our traditional averages  which may influence our overall sensor gross margins 
accordingly  we anticipate average gross margins in the sensor division to decline to from for the fiscal year ending march  consumer products business as a result of the conair transaction  we now supply bath and kitchen scales solely to oem manufacturers for sale under their labels 
as oem margins historically have been lower than retail margins  including the effect of the amortized gain related to the conair transaction see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we anticipate gross margins in the consumer products business to be in the range for the fiscal year ending march  please refer to item business in this report for additional details regarding the basis of the trends described above 
changes in our business discontinued operations in september  we sold all of the outstanding stock of terraillon holdings limited referred to herein as terraillon  a european manufacturer of branded consumer bathroom and kitchen scales  to fukuda luxembourg sarl  an investment holding company incorporated in luxembourg 
we placed our united kingdom subsidiary  measurement specialties uk limited referred to herein as schaevitz r uk  into receivership on june  pursuant to the terms of a mortgage debenture dated february  certain assets of schaevitz r uk related to the foil strain gauge sensor business were reacquired during fy in the acquisition of polaron components  ltd 
our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march    and include the results of our ongoing operations 
as a result of placing schaevitz uk into receivership and selling terraillon  these entities have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial results for all periods presented 
accordingly  all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for each of the fiscal years ended march   and exclude the results of these discontinued operations except for loss from discontinued units  cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  and net income loss 
sale of assets on january   conair corporation purchased certain assets of our thinner r branded bathroom and kitchen scale business  and now owns worldwide rights to the thinner r brand name and exclusive rights to the thinner r designs in north america 
assets sold to conair included  among other things  all inventories of finished scales  open customer purchase orders  and patents 
we previously sold our thinner r branded scales directly to retailers  predominately in the us and canada 
on a going forward basis  we expect to supply these scales directly to conair and intend to continue our efforts in the design  development and manufacture of innovative scale products for sale to our worldwide base of oem customers 
in july  we sold the assets  principally property and equipment  related to our silicon wafer fab manufacturing operation in milpitas  ca to silicon microstructures  inc smi  a wholly owned subsidiary of elmos semiconductor ag 
the wafer fab operation was formerly part of our ic sensors division 
our san jose research and design center the former ic sensors division continues to design and sell all  and manufacture most  of the product lines it produced prior to the sale  including custom wafers and die  pressure sensors  accelerometers and custom mems components  and continues to outsource to smi the manufacturing of silicon chips used in these products 
this sale is reflected in the results of operations of the sensors segment 
recent acquisitions as a result of the recent acquisition discussed in part i  item i  recent acquisitions of this annual report on form k  the financial statements are not comparable 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment 
the new fasb rule requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements  rather than disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
the scope of statement r includes a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
statement r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
fasb statement  as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to the financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
under the effective date provisions included in statement r  registrants would have been required to implement the statement s requirements as of the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june   or after december  for small business issuers 
the new rule allows registrants to implement statement r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next interim period  that begins after june   or december  for small business issuers 
the company will be required to apply fasb r beginning with the quarter ending june  the company is currently quantifying the impact of fasb r  however  the company does believe the adoption of fasb statement r will have a material effect on its financial position and results of operations consistent with the pro forma disclosures 
on november   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this new standard is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve financial reporting by eliminating differences between gaap in the united states and gaap developed by the international accounting standards board iasb 
as part of this effort  the fasb and the iasb identified opportunities to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards 
statement clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions in statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  companies must apply the standard prospectively 
the company does not believe the adoption of fasb statement will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
this new standard is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve financial reporting by eliminating differences between gaap in the united states and gaap developed by the international accounting standards board iasb 
as part of this effort  the fasb and the iasb identified opportunities to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards 
statement amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  that was issued in the amendments made by statement are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the provisions in statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  early application is permitted and companies must apply the standard prospectively 
the company does not believe the adoption of fasb statement will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this new standard replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and represents another step in the fasb s goal to converge its standards with those issued by the iasb 
among other changes  statement requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
statement also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of this standard is permitted for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe the adoption of fasb statement will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp  application of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp  which is effective immediately  states that the tax deduction of qualified domestic production activities  which is provided by the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  will be treated as a special deduction as described in sfas no 
consequently  the impact of the deduction  which is effective january   will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the company s income tax returns 
the company does not expect fsp to have a material effect on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 
fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance related to the jobs act provision  which addresses the limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
although adoption is effective immediately  fsp states that a company is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
the company is evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions of the jobs act and will complete its review by december  however  it is not expected that these provisions will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp  the company has not adjusted its tax expense or net deferred tax assets to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when earned  which occurs when the following four conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
certain consumer products may be sold with a provision allowing the customer to return a portion of products 
we provide for allowances for returns based upon historical and estimated return rates 
the amount of actual returns could differ from our estimate 
changes in estimated returns would be accounted for in the period of change 
we utilize manufacturing representatives as sales agents for certain of our products 
such representatives do not receive orders directly from customers  take title to or physical possession of products  or invoice customers 
accordingly  revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer 
certain consumer products are sold under private label arrangements with various distributors 
such products are manufactured to the distributor s specifications 
we are not responsible for the ultimate sale to third party customers and therefore record revenue upon shipment to the distributor 
on january   conair corporation purchased certain assets of our thinner r branded bathroom and kitchen scale business  and now owns worldwide rights to the thinner r brand name and exclusive rights to the thinner r designs in north america 
we have accounted for the sale of this business under the guidance of eitf as a significant portion of the proceeds from the sale was in fact an up front payment for future lost margins  the majority of the gain on sale has been deferred and will be amortized into revenues in future periods over the estimated remaining lives for those products sold to conair 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a discussion of the sale of the business to conair 
accounts receivable the majority of our accounts receivable are due from manufacturers of electronic  automotive  military  and industrial products and retailers 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer s financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are generally due within to days and are stated as amounts due from customers net of allowances for doubtful accounts  and other sales allowances 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
we determine our allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to us  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
we write off accounts receivable when we determine they are uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual uncollectible accounts could exceed our estimates and changes to our estimates will be accounted for in the period of change 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm 
for purposes of analyzing the lcm  market is current replacement cost 
market cannot exceed the net realizable value ie  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predicted costs of completion and disposal and market shall not be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin 
in evaluating lcm  management also considers  if applicable  other factors as well  including known trends  market conditions  currency exchange rates and other such issues 
if the utility of goods is impaired by damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in price levels or other causes  a loss shall be charged as cost of sales in the period which it occurs 
we make purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to our operations include slowdown in customer demand  customer delay in the issuance of sales orders  miscalculation of customer requirements  technology changes that render raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders 
we establish reserves for our inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
products that have existed in inventory for one calendar year with no usage and that have no current demand or no expected demand  will be considered obsolete and fully reserved 
obsolete inventory approved for disposal is written off against the reserve 
furthermore  consideration is given to ultimate circumstances when recording inventory reserves and the disposal of inventory considered obsolete 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters  which would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may result in additional inventory reserves and write downs  which would be accounted for in the period of change 
the level of inventory reserves reflects the nature of our industry whereby technological and other changes  such as customer buying requirements  result in impairment of inventory 
goodwill impairment management assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently under certain circumstances 
such circumstances include i significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iii unanticipated competition  iv a loss of key personnel  v a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of  and vi recognition of an impairment loss in a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
management must make assumptions regarding estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
impairment charges would be included in general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the goodwill 
acquisitions in all acquisitions  the purchase price of the acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of the acquisition 
the fair values of these items were based upon management s estimates 
certain of the acquired assets are intangible in nature  including customer relationships  patented and proprietary technology  covenants not to compete  trade names and order backlog 
the excess purchase price over the amounts allocated to the assets is recorded as goodwill 
all such valuation methodologies  including the determination of subsequent amortization periods  involve significant judgments and estimates 
different assumptions and subsequent actual events could yield materially different results 
long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with fas  accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets and fas  accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
management assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant negative industry or economic trends  iii significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and iv a change in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed using a projected discounted cash flow method at the appropriate level lowest level at which cash flows is identifiable 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
other factors could include  among other things  quoted market prices  or other valuation techniques considered appropriate based on the circumstances 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  an impairment charge may need to be recorded 
impairment charges would be included in our statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets on our balance sheet 
income taxes we file income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which we have reason to believe that we are subject to tax 
historically  we have been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions 
to date  none of these examinations has resulted in any material additional tax 
nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that our filing position regarding one or more of our transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent on generating future taxable income 
during the fiscal year ended march   we provided a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets since we believed at the time that enough uncertainty existed regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
however  because of the current and expected future results of the company  taking into account the current status of our litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a discussion of our pending litigation  we have concluded that this valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is no longer necessary  and have reversed the allowance against the provision for taxes in the fiscal year ended march  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a further discussion of our taxes 
the income tax provision is based upon the proportion of pretax profit in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the income tax rates in hong kong and china are less than those in the united states 
deferred income taxes are not provided on our subsidiaries earnings which are expected to be reinvested 
distribution  in the form of dividends or otherwise  would subject our subsidiaries earnings to united states income taxes  subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred united states income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation 
warranty reserve our sensor and consumer products generally are marketed under warranties to end users of up to five years 
factors affecting our warranty liability include the number of products sold and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim 
we provide for estimated product warranty obligations at the time of sale  based on our historical warranty claims experience and assumptions about future warranty claims 
this estimate is susceptible to changes in the near term based on introductions of new products  product quality improvements declines and changes in end user application and or behavior 
contingencies and litigation we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimates that we may have made with respect to their resolution

net sales 
sensor business 
sensor sales increased  from  to  excluding sales from recent acquisitions of  sales increased  or 
the increase in net sales for our base sensor business in the fiscal year ended march  is primarily a result of increased demand in our pressure  liquid level and traffic sensor products 
the significant contributor to the increase in net sales for these lines is the expanded demand for the automotive sector with many new platforms adopting our sensor technology which resulted in strong growth for this market segment 
strong organic growth was also realized in our acceleration  pressure  security and tilt products in the industrial  high purity  off road vehicle test and measurement and commercial market segments 
approximately  or  of the sales from recent acquisitions are attributable to elekon  entran  and humirel 
consumer products business 
net sales decreased  in the fiscal year ended march  the us retail bath scale business decreased approximately  mainly due to the sale of the thinner r branded business to conair 
however  this decrease was more than offset by an increase of  in the oem bath scale business 
there was a decrease in sales of approximately  in the tire gauge line 
the majority of this decrease is due to non repeating promotions  changes in the scope and selection of customer product assortments  and a decline in selected oem customers 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percent of sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to from for the fiscal year ended march  sensor business 
gross margin as a percent of sales for our base sensor business which excludes the effects of acquisitions decreased slightly to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  this change is due to the increase in sales of automotive sensors  which carries a lower gross margin than our average sensor business 
also contributing to the margin decline is higher commodity costs in our core sensor lines 
including acquisition sales  gross margin as a percent of sales for our sensor business decreased to 
elekon represents of the acquired sales  and carries a substantially lower gross margin than our base sensor business 
due to higher sales of lower margin product  we anticipate sensor gross margin to decline to approximately to for the fiscal year ended march  consumer products business 
gross margin as a percent of sales in our consumer products business decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the majority of the decrease was in the bathroom scale product line  and is a result of lower margins associated with sales to original equipment manufacturers as opposed to retail customers 
margins in our tire gauge product line decreased by as a result of retail pricing pressures 
due to continued pricing pressure with our oem customers and increases in commodity costs  we anticipate gross margin to decline to to for the fiscal year ended march  on a continuing basis our gross margin in the sensor and consumer products businesses may vary due to product mix  sales volume  availability of raw materials and other factors 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal excluding sg a expenses specifically associated with the acquired companies  sg a expenses decreased to approximately  the additional selling  general and administrative costs resulting from the acquisitions were more than offset by lower expenses for employee profit sharing of  and lower costs in the consumer product segment resulting from the conair transaction 
partially offsetting the decline were increased professional fees of  primarily associated with the implementation of sarbanes oxley requirements  as well as the write off of certain deferred financing costs from early loan termination fees associated with the debt refinancing and severance costs of a former executive recorded in the quarter ended december  litigation expense 
litigation expensed decreased significantly during fiscal because the company settled the sec investigation and the class action lawsuit for amounts which had been accrued during the prior fiscal year 
we recorded a net charge of  during the fiscal year ended march  relating to the sec investigation  class action lawsuit  and the hibernia capital partners litigation 
this net charge represented the combination of a  charge relating to the sec investigation  an additional  charge relating to the class action lawsuit  which was partially offset by the reversal of from the prior accrual upon the favorable settlement of the hibernia lawsuit 
non cash equity based compensation 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a non cash equity based compensation charge of  or 
per share diluted  for the vesting of the warrants issued to four corners capital partners lp  a limited partnership of which mr 
guidone is a principal 
there was no additional charge resulting from these warrants issued to four corners as all the warrants vested in the fiscal year ended march  research and development 
customer funded development for the fiscal year ended march  increased to compared to for the fiscal year ended march  on a net basis  research and development costs decreased this decrease was due to the increase in customer funded development and little change in research and development spending 
restructuring costs 
during the fiscal year ended march   we had no restructuring costs 
for the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a charge of for additional costs relating to our restructuring plan 
this charge resulted from the settlement of litigation related to our former facility in valley forge  pennsylvania 
interest expense  net 
the increase in interest expense is attributable to an increase in average debt outstanding from  for fiscal to  for fiscal  partially offset by a lower average interest rate 
the increase in debt was due to acquisitions 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit incurred during fiscal year was due to the reversal of the million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and the income tax expense incurred during fiscal year does not reflect any such adjustments 
the current year tax rate of approximately percent is lower than the prior year effective rate of approximately percent  after taking into account the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance 
the decrease in the effective tax rate as compared to last year is mainly due to three factors i a larger portion of income allocated to jurisdictions with lower tax rates  ii the recordation of deferred tax assets associated with certain temporary or timing differences for inventory reserves and depreciation  and iii the amortization of deferred tax liabilities relating to a number of the acquisitions 
during fiscal  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was reversed 
based on the evaluation of relevant factors in fiscal  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was recorded because it was determined that it was more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
in arriving at our conclusion to reverse the valuation allowance at march   we took into consideration the guidance provided by fas  after considering both positive and negative evidence 
our analysis of positive evidence supporting the conclusion that the valuation allowance was no longer applicable included the assessment of three key issues that principally lead to the allowance substantial operating losses  debt and pending litigation 
our analysis supporting the reversal of the valuation allowance was straight forward  as the positive evidence which could be objectively verified outweighed the negative evidence 
the current and expected results of the company  as well as taking into account the status of litigation  indicated that the valuation allowance was not needed 
the company had fully executed a restructuring whereby the company returned to profitability  as supported by the earnings during fiscal our provision for income taxes differs from the statutory us federal income tax rate due to our estimate and distribution of the full year s tax rate based upon the expected taxable income taxed at the applicable jurisdiction s tax rate 
the expectations and estimates utilized in calculating the tax provision and our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis involve complex domestic and foreign tax issues and are monitored closely and subject to change based on ultimate circumstances 
the utilization during fiscal of a portion of the company s net operating loss carry forward of  at march  will greatly reduce the company s cash payment for the us portion of the provision for income taxes 
we continue to evaluate the implications of the recently enacted american jobs creation act of due to  among other things  the volume of manufacturing in the us and our net operating loss carry forwards  we do not expect this act to have an immediate and significant impact on our effective tax rates

sensor sales increased  or from the fiscal year ended march  to the fiscal year ended march  this increase was due to increased ic sensors ics and microfused product line sales during fiscal as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
the improved ics product line sales of  were the result of increased demand from existing and new customers in the medical field  the introduction of a new line of instrumentation grade pressure transducers  as well as increased sales in the european and asian markets 
the improved microfused product line sales of  were primarily due to continued growth in demand in the automotive sector due to the introduction of new customer platforms 
the increase in the automotive demand accounted for  the microfused product line sales also increased across other markets to include medical  industrial  refrigeration  and flow measurement 
consumer products business 
the decrease in net sales of  for our consumer products business in the fiscal year ended march  is primarily attributable to lower bath scale and kitchen accessory sales  which were slightly offset by an increase in tire gauge sales in the us bath scale sales decreased from  to  due to the conair transaction  as conair made virtually no purchases in the month of february as they assessed the inventory that was acquired as part of the transaction 
in addition  net sales will decline for the portion of the scale business that was sold to conair because we are no longer selling at retail sales prices  which are higher than sales prices to oem customers 
kitchen accessory sales decreased to  in the year ending march  compared to the prior year sales of  due to underperformance in this product category

this accounted for an improvement of approximately 
consumer products business 
gross margin as a percent of sales in our consumer products business increased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in gross margin for our consumer products business in the fiscal year ended march  is primarily due to improved margins on our sales to original equipment manufacturers 
the margins on sales to original equipment manufacturers improved as a result of improved product mix  lower freight costs and a reduction in material costs due to our concentration on the more efficient use of raw materials in the manufacturing process 
the margin on our retail customer sales increased slightly for the period ended march  as compared to the same period ended march  this increase was mainly due to lower freight and material costs  offset slightly by lower margins for the kitchen accessories product category 
together  the improved margins on the oem and retail business are responsible for that increase in gross margin 
this is slightly offset by the kitchen accessory line s drop in margin from in fiscal to in fiscal we have decided to no longer sell kitchen accessories and liquidated much of the remaining inventory in the fiscal year ended march  at margins below historical levels 
on a continuing basis our gross margin in the sensor and consumer products businesses may vary due to product mix  sales volume  availability of raw materials and other factors 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal legal and professional fees decreased approximately  in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the higher professional fees in the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period were due to a higher level of professional activity relating to the restatement of our financial statements and the class action lawsuit and the sec investigation

for us tax purposes  our available net operating loss carry forwards will offset all current fiscal year taxable income 
during the fiscal year ended march   we provided a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets since we believed at the time that enough uncertainty existed regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets 
the company reversed this valuation allowance for the year ended march  our analysis of positive evidence supporting the conclusion that the valuation allowance was no longer applicable included the assessment of three key issues that principally lead to the allowance substantial operating losses  debt and pending litigation 
our analysis supporting the reversal of the valuation allowance was straight forward  as the positive evidence which could be objectively verified outweighed the negative evidence 
current and expected results of the company  as well as taking into account the status of litigation at that time  indicated that the valuation allowance was not needed 
the company had fully executed a restructuring whereby the company returned to profitability  as supported by the strong earnings during fiscal  coupled with the elimination of debt  a forecast indicating the company would generate more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets and the status of litigation  the company reversed the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets

other comprehensive income other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains on currency hedging contracts

we accounted for the sale of this business under the guidance of eitf dividends we have not declared cash dividends on our common equity 
the payment of dividends is prohibited under the existing credit agreement with ge 
we may  in the future  declare dividends under certain circumstances 
at present  there are no material restrictions on the ability of our hong kong subsidiary to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends  loans  advances  or purchases of materials  products  or services 
chinese laws and regulations  including currency exchange controls  restrict distribution and repatriation of dividends by our china subsidiary 
seasonality our sales of consumer products are seasonal  with highest sales during the second and third fiscal quarters 
sales of sensor products are not seasonal 
inflation we compete on the basis of product design  features  and value 
accordingly  our revenues generally have kept pace with inflation  notwithstanding that inflation in the countries where our subsidiaries are located has been consistently higher than inflation in the united states 
increases in labor costs have not had a significant impact on our business because most of our employees are in china  where prevailing labor costs are low 
however  we have experienced some significant increases in materials costs  in particular increases in steel and resin costs in our consumer business  and as a result have suffered a decline in margin 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a certain level of foreign currency exchange risk 
most of our revenues are priced in united states dollars 
most of our costs and expenses are priced in united states dollars  with the remaining priced in chinese renminbi  euros and hong kong dollars 
accordingly  the competitiveness of our products relative to products produced locally in foreign markets may be affected by the performance of the sales out of the united states dollar compared with that of our foreign customers currencies 
united states sales were   and  or  and of net sales  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
sales from our foreign facilities were   and  or  and of net sales  for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
we are exposed to foreign currency transaction and translation losses  which might result from adverse fluctuations in the value of the euro  hong kong dollar and chinese renminbi 
at march   we had net assets of  in the united states 
at march   we had net assets of in europe  subject to fluctuations in the value of the euro against the dollar 
at march   we had net assets of  in hong kong subject to fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar and net assets of  in china subject to fluctuations in the value of the chinese renminbi

at march   we had net liabilities of  in hong kong subject to fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar and net assets of  in china subject to fluctuations in the value of the chinese renminbi 
fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar have not been significant since october   when the hong kong government tied the value of the hong kong dollar to that of the united states dollar 
however  there can be no assurance that the value of the hong kong dollar will continue to be tied to that of the united states dollar 
china adopted a floating currency system on january   unifying the market and official rates of foreign exchange 
china approved current account convertibility of the chinese renminbi on july   followed by formal acceptance of the international monetary fund s articles of agreement on december  these regulations eliminated the requirement for prior government approval to buy foreign exchange for ordinary trade transactions  though approval is still required to repatriate equity or debt  including interest thereon 
the chinese government is currently reevaluating its foreign currency policy  and there have been indications  as reported widely in the news media  that the chinese government may in fact allow the chinese renminibi to revalue in the foreseeable future 
based on the net exposure of renminbi to us dollars for the fiscal year ended march   we estimate a negative operating income impact of for every appreciation in renminbi against us dollar assuming no associated cost increases or currency hedging 
based on the net exposures of euros to the us dollars for the fiscal year ended march   we estimate a positive operating income impact of for every appreciation in euros relative to the us dollar assuming no associated costs increases or currency hedging 
the company acquired a number of foreign currency exchange contracts with the purchase of humirel 
these currency contracts have a total notional amount of  with exercise dates through december  at an average exchange rate of euro to us dollar conversion rate 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges  and changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction affects earnings 
when the hedged transaction affects earnings  the appropriate gain or loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the transaction is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to cost of sales 
as of march   the amount that will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to cost of sales over the next twelve months is an unrealized loss of there is no ineffective portion of the derivatives 
there can be no assurance that these currencies will remain stable or will fluctuate to our benefit 
to manage our exposure to foreign currency transaction and translation risks  we may purchase currency exchange forward contracts  currency options  or other derivative instruments  provided such instruments may be obtained at suitable prices 
however  to date  other than for the foreign currency exchange contracts acquired with the purchase of humirel  we have not done so 
we are exposed to a certain level of interest rate risk 
interest on the principal amount of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility accrues at a rate based on either a london inter bank offered rate libor rate plus a libor margin or at an indexed prime based rate plus an index margin 
the libor or index rate is at our election 
our results will be adversely affected by any increase in interest rates 
for example  for every  of debt outstanding  an annual interest rate increase of basis points would increase interest expense and decrease our after tax profitability by we do not hedge this interest rate exposure
