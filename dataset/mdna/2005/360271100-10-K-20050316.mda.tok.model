overview as a financial institution with a focus on traditional banking activities  the corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income  the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and maintaining or increasing the net interest margin  which is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
the corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through sales of assets  such as loans or investments 
offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans  administrative expenses and income taxes 
the corporation s net income for increased million  or  from million in to million in diluted net income per share increased  or  from per share in to per share in in  the corporation realized a return on average assets of and a return on average tangible equity of compared to and in net income for increased million  or  from million in to million in diluted net income per share increased  or  from per share in to per share in the increase in earnings in was driven by a million  or  increase in net interest income due to both internal and external growth and a stable net interest margin 
contributing to this increase was a million  or  increase in other income excluding securities gains  primarily as a result of acquisitions  and a million  or  reduction in the provision for loan losses due to continued strong asset quality 
these items were was offset by a million  or  increase in other expenses  as a result of both internal and external growth  and a million  or  reduction in investment securities gains 
the following summarizes some of the more significant factors that influenced the corporation s results 
acquisitions in august  the corporation acquired premier bancorp  inc premier  a million bank holding company located in doylestown  pennsylvania whose primary subsidiary was premier bank  strengthening its presence in eastern pennsylvania markets 
in december  the corporation acquired approximately million of agricultural loans in central pennsylvania and delaware 
in april  the corporation acquired resource bankshares corporation  resource  an million financial holding 
table of contents company located in virginia beach  virginia whose primary subsidiary was resource bank 
this was the corporation s first acquisition in virginia  allowing it to enter a new geographic market 
results for in comparison to were impacted by these acquisitions referred to collectively as the acquisitions 
on december   the corporation acquired first washington financialcorp first washington  of windsor  new jersey 
first washington was a million bank holding company whose primary subsidiary was first washington state bank  which operates sixteen community banking offices in mercer  monmouth  and ocean counties in new jersey 
the accounts of first washington are included in the corporation s december  consolidated balance sheet  however  first washington did not impact average balances or the consolidated statement of income 
on january   the corporation entered into a merger agreement to acquire svb financial services  inc svb of somerville  new jersey 
svb is a million bank holding company whose primary subsidiary is somerset valley bank  which operates eleven community banking offices in somerset  hunterdon and middlesex counties in new jersey 
the acquisition is expected to be completed in the third quarter of for additional information on the terms of this pending acquisition  see note q  mergers and acquisitions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions have long been a supplement to the corporation s internal growth 
these recent and pending acquisitions provide the opportunity for additional growth as they will allow the corporation s existing products and services to be sold in new markets 
the corporation s acquisition strategy focuses on high growth areas with strong market demographics and targets organizations that have a comparable corporate culture  strong performance and good asset quality  among other factors 
under its supercommunity banking philosophy  acquired organizations generally retain their status as separate legal entities  unless consolidation with an existing affiliate bank is practical 
back office functions are generally consolidated to maximize efficiencies 
merger and acquisition activity in the financial services industry has been very competitive in recent years  as evidenced by the prices paid for certain acquisitions 
while the corporation has been an active acquirer  management is committed to basing its pricing on rational economic models 
management will continue to focus on generating growth in the most cost effective manner 
asset quality asset quality refers to the underlying credit characteristics of borrowers and the likelihood that defaults on contractual loan payments will result in charge offs of account balances 
asset quality is generally a function of economic conditions  but can be managed through conservative underwriting and sound collection policies and procedures 
the corporation has been able to maintain strong asset quality through different economic cycles  attributable to its credit culture and underwriting policies 
this trend continued in as asset quality measures such as non performing assets to total assets and net charge offs to average loans improved in comparison to  allowing a reduction in the provision for loan losses 
while overall asset quality has remained strong  deterioration in quality of one or several significant accounts could have a detrimental impact and result in losses that may not be foreseeable based on current information 
in addition  rising interest rates could increase the total payments of borrowers and could have a negative impact on their ability to pay according to the terms of their loans 
interest rates during the second half of  the frb increased short term interest rates a total of  with the overnight borrowing  or federal funds  rate ending the year at 
the average federal funds rate for the year increased basis points from in to in and the average prime lending rate increased from in to in this increase in rates resulted in an expansion of the corporation s net interest margin during after decreasing significantly during while the net interest margin for the year increased only slightly  the improvement is evident in the quarterly trend  which is shown in the following table st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter year to date unlike short term interest rates  longer terms rates remained relatively flat  with ten year united states treasury rates beginning and ending the year at about the same level 
however  this level was higher than the historic lows experienced during and and  consequently  mortgage refinance activity continued its relative slowdown which started during the third and fourth quarter of long term interest rate levels also continued to affect the corporation s deposit mix as funds from maturing time deposits continued to flow into core demand and savings accounts as customers were reluctant to lock into the relatively low rates being offered on time deposit products 

table of contents in a rising rate environment  the corporation expects improvements in net interest income  as discussed in the market risk section of management s discussion 
increasing long term rates  however  tend to have a detrimental impact on mortgage loan origination volumes and related mortgage banking income 
regulatory environment the corporation is a registered financial holding company and its subsidiary banks are depository institutions whose deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to various regulations and examinations by bank regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve  the fdic  the office of the comptroller of the currency and certain state agencies 
the financial services industry has been subjected to heightened scrutiny by bank regulatory authorities in the areas of bank secrecy act compliance and other anti money laundering rules and regulations 
as a result the corporation has hired additional staff for compliance related activities 
as a publicly traded company  the corporation is also subject to securities and exchange commission sec regulations  which govern the frequency and content of financial information required to be made available to the public 
recent legislative and regulatory actions of the federal government have significantly changed financial reporting requirements  primarily as a result of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley 
for the financial statements and footnotes  sarbanes oxley required management to issue a report on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  the corporation s independent public accountants were required to issue an opinion on management s report and the corporation s internal controls over financial reporting 
these reports can be found after the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
the burden of compliance with the new reporting requirements has been significant for all publicly traded companies  including the corporation 
the cost includes both the time devoted by its employees to complete the documentation and testing of controls and the expense for engaging professionals to assist in the process 
in addition  the corporation experienced a significant increase in independent accountant fees related to the internal controls testing process

table of contents results of operations net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of the corporation s net income  accounting for approximately of total revenues  excluding investment securities gains 
the ability to manage net interest income over a variety of interest rate and economic environments is important to the success of a financial institution 
growth in net interest income is generally dependent upon balance sheet growth and maintaining or growing the net interest margin

net interest income increased million  or  from million in to million in  primarily as a result of earning asset growth as the corporation s net interest margin for the year was relatively constant at for compared to for average earning assets grew  from billion in to billion in the acquisitions contributed approximately million to this increase in average balances 
interest income increased million  or  mainly as a result of the increase in average earning assets  which resulted in a million increase in interest income 
this increase was partially offset by the million decrease in interest income that resulted from the decline in the average yield earned 
this reflects the impact of customers favoring floating rate loans which tend to carry lower interest rates than fixed rate products 

table of contents the increase in average interest earning assets was due to loan growth  both internal and through acquisitions  as investment balances remained relatively flat

table of contents loan growth continued to be strong in the commercial and commercial mortgage categories 
the growth shown in the commercial agricultural category reflects the agricultural loan portfolio purchased in december the reduction in mortgage loan balances was due to customer refinance activity that occurred during the corporation generally sells newly originated fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market to promote liquidity and manage interest rate risk 
home equity loans increased significantly due to promotional efforts and customers using home equity loans as a cost effective refinance alternative and as a preferred type of consumer loan 
consumer loans decreased  reflecting customers repayment of these loans with tax advantaged residential mortgage or home equity loans 
in addition  the indirect finance market remains extremely competitive with the participation of vehicle manufacturers 
the average yield on loans during was  a basis point  or  decline from much of the recent loan growth has been experienced in the floating rate categories that tend to carry lower interest rates than fixed rate products 
average investments decreased slightly during  however  without the impact of the acquisitions  the investment balances would have decreased million  or 
the corporation s investment balances had increased over the last few years due to both significant deposit growth and the use of limited strategies to manage the corporation s gap position and to take advantage of low short term borrowing rates 
during  the corporation did not reinvest a significant portion of investment maturities in order to minimize interest rate risk in expectation of a rising rate environment and to help fund loan growth 
the average yield on investment securities declined slightly from in to in premium amortization  which is accounted for as a reduction of interest income  was million in compared to million in the benefit from the lower premium amortization was offset by the reduction in stated yields experienced throughout interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in  mainly as a result of billion increase in average interest bearing liabilities  which included approximately million added by the acquisitions 
the increase in average interest bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of million during this increase was partially offset by a million decrease due to the basis point decrease in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities 
the cost of interest bearing deposits declined basis points  or  from in to in this reduction was due to both the impact of declining short term interest rates in the first half of and the continuing shift in the composition of deposits from higher rate time deposits to lower rate demand and savings deposits 
customers continued to exhibit an unwillingness to invest in certificates of deposit at the rates available  instead keeping their funds in demand and savings products 
the following table presents the growth in average deposits  by type increase dollars in thousands noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand savings money market time deposits total

the acquisitions added million to the short term borrowings increase and million to the long term debt increase 
the additional increase in short term borrowings resulted primarily from certain limited strategies employed during to manage the corporation s gap position and to take advantage of low short term borrowing rates 
in addition  customer cash management accounts  which are included in short term borrowings  grew million  or  to an average of million in vs 
net interest income decreased million  or  from million in to million in while average earning assets grew  from billion in to billion in  the net interest margin declined  or basis points  from in to in as a result of the interest rate environment 
during  yields earned on assets decreased further than rates paid on liabilities 
interest income decreased million  or  mainly as a result of the basis point decrease in the average yield on earning assets 
average yields decreased during due both to the general decrease in short term interest rates as well as the shift in earning assets  on a percentage basis  from higher yielding loans to generally lower yielding investment securities 
the decrease of million as a result of rates was partially offset by a million increase due to average earning asset growth 
average loans increased million  or  to billion in loan growth was particularly strong in the commercial and commercial mortgage categories 
even factoring out the loans acquired in the premier acquisition  these categories both grew approximately 
the significant reduction in mortgage loan balances was due to customer refinance activity that continued at a high rate through much of the year 
the corporation generally sells newly originated fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market to promote liquidity and manage interest rate risk 
home equity loans increased significantly due to promotional efforts and customers using home equity loans as a cost effective refinance alternative 
consumer loans decreased  reflecting customers repayment of these loans with tax advantaged residential mortgage or home equity loans 
in addition  many vehicle manufacturers continued to offer attractive financing rates  with which the corporation chose not to compete 

table of contents the average yield on loans during was  a basis point  or  decline from this reflects the basis point reduction in the corporation s average prime lending rate from in to in  as well as higher than normal prepayments received on fixed rate commercial and commercial mortgage loans 
average investment securities increased million  or  during the increase was attributable primarily to deposit growth exceeding loan growth 
total average deposit growth of million exceeded average loan growth by million during in addition  the corporation employed certain limited strategies to manage the corporation s gap position and to take advantage of low short term borrowing rates 
most of the growth in investment securities was in mortgage backed securities  which increased by million  or 
the average yield on investment securities declined significantly from in to in this decrease was due to both the relatively short maturity of the portfolio as well as the high prepayment levels experienced on mortgage backed securities 
during and  most mortgage backed securities were being purchased at premiums 
as longer term interest rates continued to fall through the first half of  the prepayments on these securities exceeded expected levels 
prepayments negatively impact yields through the acceleration of premium amortization expense  which is accounted for as a reduction of interest income 
premium amortization was million in compared to million in approximately million of premium amortization during was accelerated amortization 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in  mainly as a result of the basis point decrease in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities 
this decrease in cost resulted in a million decrease in interest expense  which was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense due to average balance growth 
the cost of interest bearing deposits declined basis points  or  from in to in this reduction was due to both the impact of declining short term interest rates and the continuing shift in the composition of deposits from higher rate time deposits to lower rate demand and savings deposits 
customers continued to exhibit an unwillingness to invest in certificates of deposit at the rates available  instead keeping their funds in demand and savings products 
the acquisition of premier added million to the total average balance of deposits in if those balances were factored out  the deposit categories would show the following increases decreases noninterest bearing demand   interest bearing demand   savings money market   and time deposits  
average short term borrowings increased million  or  to million in  while average long term debt increased million  or  to million in the increase in short term borrowings resulted primarily from certain limited strategies to manage the corporation s gap position and to take advantage of low short term borrowing rates 
in addition  customer cash management accounts  which are included in short term borrowings  grew million  or  to reach million in provision and allowance for loan losses the corporation accounts for the credit risk associated with lending activities through its allowance and provision for loan losses 
the provision is the expense recognized in the income statement to adjust the allowance to its proper balance  as determined through the application of the corporation s allowance methodology procedures 
these procedures include the evaluation of the risk characteristics of the portfolio and documentation in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues sab 
see critical accounting policies on page for a discussion of the corporation s allowance for loan loss evaluation methodology 

table of contents a summary of the corporation s loan loss experience follows year ended december dollars in thousands loans outstanding at end of year daily average balance of loans and leases balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of year loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer leasing and other total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer leasing and other total recoveries net loans charged off provision for loan losses allowance purchased balance at end of year selected asset quality ratios net charge offs to average loans allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at end of year non performing assets to total assets non accrual loans to total loans includes accruing loans past due days or more 

table of contents the following table presents the aggregate amount of non accrual and past due loans and other real estate owned december in thousands non accrual loans accruing loans past due days or more other real estate totals as of december   the additional interest income that would have been recorded during if nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was approximately million 
the amount of interest income on nonaccrual loans that was included in income was approximately million 
accrual of interest is generally discontinued when a loan becomes days past due as to principal and interest 
when interest accruals are discontinued  interest credited to income is reversed 
nonaccrual loans are restored to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest becomes current or the loan is considered secured and in the process of collection 
certain loans  primarily residential mortgages  that are determined to be sufficiently collateralized may continue to accrue interest after reaching days past due 
excluded from the amounts presented at december  are million in loans where possible credit problems of borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
these loans are considered to be impaired under statement  but continue to pay according to their contractual terms and are therefore not included in non performing loans 
nonaccrual loans include million of impaired loans 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type december dollars in thousands allowance of loans in each category allowance of loans in each category allowance of loans in each category allowance of loans in each category allowance of loans in each category comm l  financial agriculture real estate mortgage consumer  leasing other unallocated totals over the past several years  the procedures used by the banking industry to evaluate the allowance for loan losses have received increased attention from the sec  regulatory bodies and the accounting industry 
these groups have attempted to reconcile the accounting theory of reserving for loan losses  which requires that the allowance represent management s estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date  with the regulatory goals of safety and soundness 
while the resulting guidance provided by these groups has not changed the accounting  it has focused on clarifying the application of existing accounting pronouncements and improving documentation 
as with others in the industry  the corporation has used this guidance to improve its process and its documentation 
the unallocated allowance for loan losses  as shown in the preceding table  decreased at december  to at december  the corporation continues to monitor its allowance methodology to ensure compliance with both regulatory and accounting industry policies 

table of contents the provision for loan losses decreased million from million in to million in  after decreasing million in these decreases reflect the continued improvement in the corporation s asset quality reflected in both lower net charge offs and lower non performing assets ratios 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were in  an eleven basis point improvement over in  which was a five basis point decrease from non performing assets as a percentage of total assets decreased slightly from at december  to at december   after decreasing basis points in the declines in both ratios reflect the improving quality of the corporation s portfolio during the years 
the provision for loan losses in resulted from the corporation s allowance allocation procedures 
the continued growth of the corporation s commercial loan and commercial mortgage portfolios  which are inherently more risky than other loan types  is a trend which would indicate the need for a higher allowance balance 
offsetting these trends were the improvements in the quality of the corporation s portfolio  as evidenced by its improving asset quality measures over the past several years 
the net result of the corporation s allowance allocation procedures was a provision for loan losses that was million less than and was comparable to total net charge offs for the year 
management believes that the allowance balance of million at december  is sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio on that date and is appropriate based on applicable accounting standards

other assets increased million  or  in to million  including million as a result of the acquisitions  an increase in the net deferred tax asset mainly as a result of decreases in unrealized gains on investment securities  and an million increase in investments in low income housing projects 
during  equity investments of million were made to eight new partnerships 
the corporation made its initial investment of this type during and is now involved in partnerships  located in the communities served by its subsidiary banks 
the carrying value of these investments was approximately million at december  with these investments  the corporation not only improves the quantity and quality of available housing for low income individuals in support of its banks community reinvestment act compliance efforts  but also becomes eligible for tax credits under federal and  in some cases state  programs 
deposits and borrowings deposits increased billion  or  to billion at december  million  or  excluding the acquisitions 
this compares to an increase of million  or  in  million  or  excluding the premier acquisition 
the recent trend has been strong growth in core demand and savings accounts  offset by declines in time deposits 
consumers have continued to favor banks over the equity markets  even though market performance has recovered some of its decline from the past few years 
in addition  the relatively low interest rate environment resulted in consumers continuing to favor demand and savings products over time deposits 
although short term rates have increased in  longer term rate increases have not been as significant 
if longer term rates increase significantly in the future  consumers may shift their deposit funds to higher cost time deposits 
during  demand deposits increased million  or million  or  excluding the acquisitions  savings deposits increased million  or million  or  excluding the acquisitions and time deposits increased   or decrease of million  or  excluding the acquisitions

short term borrowings  which consist mainly of federal funds purchased and customer cash management accounts  decreased million  or million  or  excluding the acquisitions  in after increasing million  or  in 
table of contents the decrease in was due to strategies to reduce overnight federal funds purchased in the recent rising rate environment 
in  the increase resulted from actions taken to manage the gap position and to take advantage of low short term borrowing rates 
long term debt increased million  or decrease of million  or  excluding the acquisitions 
the decrease in was due to a decrease in federal home loan bank advances 
long term debt increased million  or  during mainly due to million of junior subordinated debentures assumed from premier 
other liabilities other liabilities increased million  or million  or  excluding the acquisitions  following a million  or  decrease in the increase in was primarily attributable to additional equity commitments for low income housing projects million increase  an increase in accrued retirement benefits million and an increase in dividends payable to shareholders million 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity of billion  or of ending total assets  increased million  or  since december  this growth reflected the issuance of stock to effect the acquisitions in the amount of million  offset by treasury stock purchases of million 
shareholders equity was also increased by retained earnings of million 
the corporation periodically implements stock repurchase plans for various corporate purposes 
in addition to evaluating the financial benefits of implementing repurchase plans  management also considers liquidity needs  the current market price per share and regulatory limitations 
in  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan for million shares  which was extended through june  during  million shares were repurchased under this plan 
on june   the board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan for million shares through december  during  million shares were repurchased under this plan  including million shares acquired under an accelerated share repurchase program 
on december   the board of directors extended the stock repurchase plan through june  and increased the total number of shares that could be repurchased to million 
no shares were purchased under this extended plan in the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by various banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various financial obligations that may require future cash payments 
these obligations include the payment of liabilities recorded on the corporation s balance sheet as well as contractual obligations for purchased services or for operating leases 
the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations to third parties  by type  that are fixed and determinable at december  payments due in one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands deposits with no stated maturity a time deposits b short term borrowings c long term debt c operating leases d purchase obligations e a includes demand deposits and savings accounts  which can be withdrawn by customers at any time

d see additional information regarding operating leases in note n  leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
e includes significant information technology  telecommunication and data processing outsourcing contracts 
variable obligations  such as those based on transaction volumes  are not included 
in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the preceding table  the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash needs as they may expire without being drawn

table of contents critical accounting policies the following is a summary of those accounting policies that the corporation considers to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations as they require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance and provision for loan losses the corporation accounts for the credit risk associated with its lending activities through the allowance and provision for loan losses 
the allowance is an estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the provision is the periodic charge to earnings  which is necessary to adjust the allowance to its proper balance 
on a quarterly basis  the corporation assesses the adequacy of its allowance through a methodology that consists of the following identifying loans for individual review under fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan statement 
in general  these consist of large balance commercial loans and commercial mortgages  that are rated less than satisfactory based upon the corporation s internal credit rating process 
assessing whether the loans identified for review under statement are impaired 
that is  whether it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
for loans identified as impaired  calculating the estimated fair value  using observable market prices  discounted cash flows or the value of the underlying collateral 
classifying all non impaired large balance loans based on credit risk ratings and allocating an allowance for loan losses based on appropriate factors  including recent loss history for similar loans 
identifying all smaller balance homogeneous loans for evaluation collectively under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies statement 
in general  these loans include residential mortgages  consumer loans  installment loans  smaller balance commercial loans and mortgages and lease receivables 
statement loans are segmented into groups with similar characteristics and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on recent loss history and other relevant information 
reviewing the results to determine the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses 
this review gives additional consideration to factors such as the mix of loans in the portfolio  the balance of the allowance relative to total loans and non performing assets  trends in the overall risk profile of the portfolio  trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans and local and national economic conditions 
an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure 
documenting the results of its review in accordance with sab the allowance review methodology is based on information known at the time of the review 
changes in factors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount of provision to be charged against earnings 
such changes could impact future results 
accounting for business combinations the corporation accounts for all business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations statement 
purchase accounting requires the purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
it also requires assessing the existence of and  if necessary  assigning a value to certain intangible assets 
the remaining excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the purchase price is established as the value of securities issued for the acquisition  cash consideration paid and certain acquisition related expenses 
the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are typically established through appraisals  observable market values or discounted cash flows 
management has engaged independent third party valuation experts to assist in valuing certain assets  particularly intangibles 
other assets and liabilities are generally valued using the corporation s internal asset liability modeling system 
the assumptions used and the final valuations  whether prepared internally or by a third party  are reviewed by management 
due to the complexity of purchase accounting  final determinations of values can be time consuming and  occasionally  amounts included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income are based on preliminary estimates of value 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives 
some intangible assets have indefinite lives and are  therefore  not amortized 
all intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment if certain events occur 
any impairment write downs are recognized as expense in the consolidated income statement 
goodwill is not amortized to expense  but is evaluated at least annually for impairment 
the corporation completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of october st of each year 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units 
a fair value is then determined for each reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of the recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair values are less than the book values  an additional test is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the corporation determined that no impairment write offs were necessary during  and business unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates for the reporting units  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges in the future 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes  adjusted for the effect of certain tax exempt income and non deductible expenses 
in addition  certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate 
the corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if any such assets are not likely to be recovered  a valuation allowance must be recognized 
the corporation has determined that a valuation allowance is not required for deferred tax assets as of december   except in the case of deferred tax benefits related to state income tax net operating losses 
the assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions  changes in which could have a material impact on the corporation s financial statements 
see also note k  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements note a  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact of recently issued accounting standards which have not yet been adopted by the corporation 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s equity investments consist of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions  us government and agency stocks and money market mutual funds 
the equity investments most susceptible to equity market price risk are the financial institutions stocks  which had a cost basis of approximately million and a fair value of million at december  gross unrealized gains in this portfolio were approximately million at december  although the carrying value of the financial institutions stocks accounted only for of the corporation s total assets  the unrealized gains on the portfolio represent a potential source of revenue 
the corporation has a history of realizing gains from this portfolio and  if values were to decline significantly  this revenue source could be lost 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the companies 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided in the table on page as such investments do not have maturity dates 
the corporation has evaluated  based on existing accounting guidance  whether any unrealized losses on individual equity investments constituted other than temporary impairment  which would require a write down through a charge to earnings 
based on the results of such evaluations  the corporation recorded write downs of  in and million in for specific equity securities which were deemed to exhibit other than temporary impairment in value 
through december   gains of approximately million had been realized on the sale of investments previously written down and  as of december   the impaired securities still held in the portfolio had recovered approximately million of the original write down amount 
additional impairment charges may be necessary depending upon the performance of the equity markets in general and the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
see also note c  investment securities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the risk of changes in the value of its equity portfolio  the corporation s investment management and trust services revenue could also be impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets 
a portion of the corporation s trust revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios 
if securities markets contract  the corporation s revenue could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the ability of the corporation to sell its brokerage services is dependent  in part  upon consumers level of confidence in the outlook for rising securities prices 
interest rate risk  asset liability management and liquidity interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
second  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net interest income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a weekly basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to address the liquidity and net interest income risks noted above 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity sources are found on both sides of the balance sheet 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal reductions and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments 
liquidity is also provided through the availability of deposits and borrowings 

table of contents the corporation s sources and uses of cash were discussed in general terms in the overview section of management s discussion 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide additional information 
the corporation generated million in cash from operating activities during  mainly due to net income 
investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million  compared to a net cash outflow of million in in  proceeds from maturities and sales of investment securities exceeded reinvestments in the portfolio and the net increase in the loan portfolio 
in  funds provided by investment maturities and increased borrowings were used to purchase additional investment securities 
financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million in  compared to a net cash inflow of in as funds provided by maturing investments were used to reduce short term borrowings 
liquidity must also be managed at the fulton financial corporation parent company level 
for safety and soundness reasons  banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends 
generally  these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks regulatory capital levels and their net income 
until  the parent company has been able to meet its cash needs through normal  allowable dividends and loans 
however  as a result of increased acquisition activity and stock repurchase plans  the parent company s cash needs have increased  requiring additional sources of funds in in  the parent company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with an unaffiliated bank 
under the terms of the agreement  the parent company can borrow up to million may be increased to million upon request with interest calculated at the one month london interbank offering rate libor plus 
the credit agreement requires the corporation to maintain certain financial ratios related to capital strength and earnings 
the corporation was in compliance with all required covenants under the credit agreement as of december  this borrowing arrangement supplements the liquidity available from subsidiaries through dividends and borrowings and provides some flexibility in parent company cash management 
as of december   million had been borrowed on this line 
management continues to monitor the liquidity and capital needs of the parent company and will implement appropriate strategies  as necessary  to remain well capitalized and to meet its cash needs 
in addition to its normal recurring and operating cash needs  the parent company will also pay cash for a portion of the svb acquisition  which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of based on the terms of the merger agreement  the parent company will pay a minimum of approximately million and a maximum of approximately million to consummate the acquisition 
see note q  mergers and acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the terms of this transaction 
at december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  federal funds sold  mortgages available for sale  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion  or of total assets 
this compares to billion  or of total assets  at december 
table of contents the following tables set forth the maturities of investment securities at december  and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated based on historical cost held to maturity at amortized cost maturing within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government and agency securities state and municipal other securities totals mortgage backed securities available for sale at estimated fair value maturing within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government and agency securities state and municipal other securities totals mortgage backed securities weighted average yields on tax exempt securities have been computed on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of percent 
maturities for mortgage backed securities are dependent upon the interest rate environment and prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  the entire balance and weighted average rate is shown in one period 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists mainly of mortgage backed securities which do not have stated maturities 
cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans  and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates 
as rates increase  cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans decrease 
as rates decrease  cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase 
the corporation invests primarily in five and seven year balloon mortgage backed securities to limit interest rate risk and promote liquidity 

table of contents the following table presents the approximate contractual maturity and sensitivity of certain loan types  excluding consumer loans and leases  to changes in interest rates as of december  one year or less one through five years more than five years total in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural floating rate fixed rate total real estate mortgage floating rate fixed rate total real estate construction floating rate fixed rate total from a funding standpoint  the corporation has been able to rely over the years on a stable base of core deposits 
even though the corporation has experienced notable changes in the composition and interest sensitivity of this deposit base  it has been able to rely on this base to provide needed liquidity 
the corporation also has access to sources of large denomination or jumbo time deposits and repurchase agreements as potential sources of liquidity 
however  the corporation has attempted to minimize its reliance upon these more volatile short term funding sources and to use them primarily to meet the requirements of its existing customer base or when it is profitable to do so 
contractual maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  are as follows in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total each of the corporation s subsidiary banks is a member of the fhlb and has access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
at december   the corporation had million in term advances from the fhlb with an additional billion of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent commercial banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity 

table of contents the following table provides information about the corporation s interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
the table presents expected cash flows and weighted average rates for each significant interest rate sensitive financial instrument  by expected maturity period dollars in thousands

average rates are shown on a fully taxable equivalent basis using an effective tax rate of 
floating rate loans include adjustable rate commercial loans and mortgages which may not reprice immediately upon a change in interest rates 
amounts are based on contractual maturities of fixed rate time deposits 
money market  super now  now and savings accounts are placed based on history of deposit flows 
amounts are based on contractual maturities of federal home loan bank advances  adjusted for possible calls 
amounts are federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which mature in less than days 
the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected cash flows from financial instruments 
expected maturities  however  do not necessarily reflect the net interest income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from expected cash flows 
in addition to the interest rate sensitive instruments included in the preceding table  the corporation also had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million as of december  these swaps were used to hedge certain long term fixed rate certificates of deposit held at one of the corporation s affiliate banks 
the terms of the certificates of deposit and the interest rate swaps mirror each other and were committed to simultaneously 
under the terms of the agreements  the corporation is the fixed rate receiver and the floating rate payer generally tied to the three month london interbank offering rate  or libor  a common index used for setting rates between financial institutions 
the combination of the interest rate swaps and the issuance of the certificates of deposit generates long term floating rate funding for the corporation 

table of contents the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  level of risk as time evolves  and exposure to changes in interest rates 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into repricing periods 
the assets and liabilities in each of these periods are compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits not having a contractual maturity are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans and for mortgage backed securities includes the effect of expected cash flows 
estimated prepayment effects are applied to these balances based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative month gap to plus or minus of total earning assets 
the cumulative month gap as of december  was 
the following is a summary of the interest sensitivity gaps for various time intervals as of december  days days days gap cumulative gap simulation of net interest income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for every basis point shock in interest rates 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of short term interest rates with changes across the yield curve based upon industry projections 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income due to the current low rates  only the basis shock in a downward scenario is shown rate shock annual change in net interest income change bp million bp million bp million bp million economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset cash flows and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock movement in interest rates
