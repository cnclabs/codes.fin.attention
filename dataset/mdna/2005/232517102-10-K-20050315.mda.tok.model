item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview our products are sold primarily into the electronics assembly and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets  where we sell products both to original equipment manufacturers of production equipment and to end user customers that produce circuit boards and semiconductor wafers and devices 
historically these markets have been very cyclical  with periods of rapid growth as worldwide capacity is added to support increased consumer demand for electronic products  and new capital equipment is purchased as a result of technology changes in electronics components  such as miniaturization  and changing production requirements 
these periods of growth have historically been followed by periods of excess capacity and reduced capital spending 
we experienced an exceptionally strong year in  as increased revenues were driven by growth in the electronic assembly and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets that began in the second half of  and continued for much of in addition  market acceptance of new and enhanced products developed during the industry downturn from to early  and our expanded asian distribution channel allowed us to increase market penetration and participate more fully in this industry recovery 
as a result we reported sequential quarter over quarter revenue growth from the third quarter of through the third quarter of  where we reported near record revenues of million and increased consolidated revenues for fiscal by over this strong followed a period from to early where the electronics and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets were significantly depressed 
during a portion of this period second half of to mid our two largest oem customers  which accounted for of our revenue in  virtually ceased ordering products 
the level of revenues from our semiconductor and smt systems product groups was also significantly impacted by this severe industry decline 
operating results also significantly benefited from a lower cost structure implemented during  and in response to reduced revenues and operating losses  we took aggressive cost reduction actions  including reducing our worldwide employment by over from peaks  and closing or downsizing facilities 
as a result  operating profits reached million and net income reached million or per diluted share  compared to net losses reported from to net income in reflects a effective tax rate  which is significantly lower than statutory rates 
see note of this form k for a further discussion of the accounting treatment for income taxes 
our balance sheet is also well positioned as the result of improved operating results and effective management of working capital and other assets 
we have no debt and our cash and marketable securities are million at december  compared to million at december  we generated million of cash and marketable securities in  of which approximately million was from operating activities  including capital purchases  and approximately million from issuing shares as the result of option exercises and participation in the employee stock purchase plan 
toward the end of the third quarter of  the global markets for electronics again began to soften 
although the economies in the countries where most of our products are sold continue to be strong  the semiconductor market has weakened and with it the circuit board production market 
we began seeing reduced order rates toward the end of the third quarter and those reduced rates continued into the first quarter of although they were relatively flat as compared to sales in the last quarter of  our revenue declined in the last quarter of as compared to the near record revenue we recorded in the third quarter 
order rates stabilized in the fourth quarter and in the first few months of accordingly  and although we cannot predict with precision the trends in markets for electronic inspection  we do not anticipate any further deterioration in the markets or in revenue in the near future 
results of operations for the three years ended december  revenues our revenues increased by to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line in thousands oem solutions electronic assembly sensors    semiconductor products    smt systems    total    revenues from our electronic assembly sensors products increased million or during compared to  and by million or during compared to during  revenues from electronic assembly sensors  primarily our laseralign sensors  were positively impacted by improved market conditions in the worldwide market for smt capital equipment and by the introduction of two new sensors for one of our large customers 
these sensors were designed for the latest generation pick and place machine of this customer  which was introduced during and result in a higher content of our products per machine than in the previous version 
during  revenues began to improve during the second half of the year due to improved market conditions and the initial introduction of the previously discussed new sensors 
during  revenues were negatively impacted by the depressed market conditions in the worldwide market for smt capital equipment 
this slowdown began in the first half of and continued throughout and early the market impact was compounded by the relatively large inventory of laseralign sensors that had been accumulated by our two principal customers during  resulting in virtually no new orders from those customers during the second half and early revenues from semiconductor products including revenues from imagenation frame grabber products for semiconductor and other applications increased million or in compared to  following a decrease of  or in compared to the increase in was primarily due to higher revenues from wafer mapping sensors as a result of improved market conditions in the semiconductor fabrication capital equipment market for much of frame grabber revenues increased slightly in compared to  as the result of improved conditions in the general industrial capital equipment markets 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily the result of lower frame grabber revenues  reflecting a technology change away from analog frame grabbers like those we sell and weakness in the general industrial capital equipment market 
revenues from wafer mapping sensors were approximately flat between and revenues from our smt systems products increased million or during compared to and increased million or during compared to during and  revenues from smt systems  primarily our se solder paste inspection system  were positively impacted by improved market conditions in the smt capital equipment markets and by success in selling systems to many of the large manufacturers of circuit boards in asia particularly china 
a large portion of the worldwide production capacity for printed circuit boards is being added in asia  and we have been successful in selling inspection systems to new and existing customers in that region through our expanded distribution capability opened singapore sales office in and a sales office in china in 
in addition  during revenues from our ks series aoi systems increased million compared to levels 
we believe that increased use of outsourcing for circuit board assembly  production difficulties associated with smaller component sizes  increased production speeds and increased cost pressure on companies manufacturing circuit boards has caused increased demand for our inspection equipment 
international revenue totaled million in  million in and million in  comprising  and of total revenue  respectively 
the international markets of china and the rest of asia  japan and europe account for a significant portion of the production capability of capital equipment for the manufacture of electronics  the primary market for our electronic assembly sensor and smt system product lines 
as manufacturing of electronic components has migrated offshore  and particularly to china  an increasing proportion of our sales have been to international customers 
gross margin gross margin increased to of sales in from in and in there are three primary reasons for improved gross margins as a percentage of revenues in and increased revenue volume  a change in our revenue mix with higher levels of oem sensor revenues and the impact of cost reduction measures implemented during to our gross margin is highly dependent on the level of revenues and resulting production levels over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs that do not vary with activity levels 
in addition  with higher production volumes manufacturing processes become more efficient and we are able to negotiate lower material costs from our suppliers as the result of volume discounts which reduces the overall cost of producing products for sale 
revenue levels increased in compared to and increased in compared to  significantly contributing to higher gross margins 
further  our oem sensor products carry higher gross margins as a percentage of revenues than end user systems products  and our sensor products constituted a growing proportion of our total revenue in and also contributing to higher gross margins in compared to  was significantly reduced cost for obsolete inventory 
partially offsetting these positive influences on gross margins are continued price pressure resulting in lower selling prices for our products  particularly our end user systems products  and increased warranty costs in compared to we expect lower forecasted sales levels in early  and continued pricing pressure as a result of additional competitors in the marketplace to have a negative impact on gross margins 
research and development expenses we increased research and development expenses by to million in  following a decrease of to million in compared to million in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased to in  compared to in and in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expense was maintained at relatively high levels during and  as we continued to fund product development on important new products even as revenue levels declined 
although in early our investment in research and development remained relatively constant with levels  as revenue levels continued to grow throughout we increased the level of research and development spending to accelerate completion of projects and to increase the number of development projects in process 
in addition  costs of company wide incentive programs associated with increased revenue and profits significantly contributed to increased research and development expense in reduced research and development expense in compared to was primarily the result of a series of cost reduction initiatives implemented during those periods in reaction to declining revenues 
during and  research and development efforts were primarily focused on initial development activities for several new sensor products  including development activities on the new embedded process verification sensor family epv  continued development of the se and ks series inspection systems  next generation laseralign products  board alignment cameras and enhancements to the semiconductor wafer mapping sensor family 
in addition  we are continuing development of new products for the semiconductor market  and are completing development of the recently introduced wafersense auto leveling sensor als 
customer funded research and development is recognized as a reduction of research and development expense 
during  customer funded research and development expense totaled  compared to  in and  in we are currently expecting research and development expenditures to be flat or slightly lower in as compared to however  we are currently considering several additional projects and may increase expenditures based on an assessment of the future revenue and profit potential of new products and our expected operating results 
selling  general and administrative expenses we increased our selling  general and administrative expenses by to million in  following a decrease of to million in compared to million in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in  compared to in and in the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily due to additional investment in sales and marketing  primarily in asia  increases in other costs associated with supporting a growing end user systems revenue base and company wide incentive programs associated with higher revenue and profit levels 
in addition  increased corporate governance costs  including costs associated with implementing an internal control framework in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of had a significant impact on increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
the dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to the effect of cost reduction measures implemented during those periods  which primarily included workforce reductions and related costs and reductions in other discretionary spending 
we are currently expecting selling  general and administrative expenses in to be at or about the levels recorded in restructuring and severance costs during to  we implemented a series of workforce reductions  closed our facility in california  downsized facilities in the uk and minneapolis and made other reductions in discretionary spending designed to reduce our cost structure in light of declining revenues during those periods caused by the depressed capital equipment markets for suppliers to electronics manufacturing 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of  these charges reflected our change in estimate relative to the amount of sub lease income we will receive from space vacated during the corporate restructuring in december although this space is being marketed for sub lease  we have not been successful in securing a sub lease tenant and our lease term ends in may consequently  we determined it was appropriate to record an additional charge assuming that no sub lease income would be received on the property vacated during in december  we completed the buy out of our uk facility lease effective in the first quarter of following this buyout  we signed a new lease for less space in the same facility 
the cost of the buy out  paid in december  was approximately  in addition  during december  we permanently vacated approximately  square feet of our primary minneapolis facility and recorded a restructure charge of approximately  for future lease payments reduced for estimated sub lease income of approximately  and related costs 
in september  we incurred approximately  of severance and costs associated with restructuring measures 
cost reduction measures included workforce reductions associated with downsizing direct sales and marketing resources in north america and europe  the consolidation of uk r d operations into our minneapolis headquarters and other general cost reduction measures 
severance costs were associated with a planned workforce reduction of people 
of these costs  approximately  was paid as of december  severance and associated costs of  were accrued as of december   and paid as of september  in january  we incurred approximately  of severance costs and facility closure costs associated with further consolidation of our semiconductor product group from redwood city  california to portland  oregon 
severance costs were associated with a workforce reduction of people 
substantially all of these costs were paid as of march  in june  we incurred approximately  of severance and related costs associated with cost reduction measures 
cost reduction measures included a workforce reduction  and discretionary spending reductions 
severance costs were associated with a workforce reduction of people 
approximately  of these costs was paid as of december  severance costs of approximately  were accrued as of december   and substantially paid as of june  in january  we incurred approximately  of severance costs associated with cost reduction measures 
cost reduction measures included a workforce reduction  discretionary spending reductions  and the consolidation of semiconductor product manufacturing in portland  oregon 
severance costs were associated with a workforce reduction of people 
approximately  of these costs was paid as of december  facility exit and severance costs of  were accrued as of december  and all were paid in january changes to the restructuring liability accounts included the following in thousands employee termination benefits lease commitment costs other total restructuring liability  december  initial expense and accrual   cash payments   restructuring liability  december  initial expense and accrual  cash payments  restructuring liability  december  change in estimate cash payments restructuring liability  december  gain on technology transfer and license in march  we transferred to the optical gaging products ogp division of quality vision international  inc qvi the rights and technology necessary to manufacture our digital range sensors drs 
in addition  we granted qvi a non exclusive license to the intellectual property associated with this product line and sold a portion of our inventory as part of this transaction 
qvi had been the primary customer for drs sensors prior to this agreement as part of a separate agreement 
the agreement called for qvi to pay  as a one time fee for the purchase of fixtures  a technology transfer fee and a non refundable royalty payment 
in addition  we sold qvi raw material inventories associated with the product line 
the gain was determined as the difference between the proceeds received and our carrying value of product line inventory and fixed assets prior to the sale 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded a  gain in the three month period ended march  amortization of intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets was approximately  in compared to million in and million in the decrease in amortization during compared to is primarily the result of a  charge in to accelerate the amortization of certain intangible assets established as the result of the acquisition of hama laboratories  inc in in addition  certain acquired intangible assets became fully amortized during amortization of intangible assets is expected to be approximately million in during the third quarter of  the amortization of intangible assets related to certain product lines and technologies were determined to be non strategic 
these general purpose sensor product lines were discontinued during  and consequently  amortization of the developed technology was accelerated 
the acceleration of the amortization resulted in approximately  of additional amortization expense during the third quarter of effective tax rate we carry the benefit we will derive in future accounting periods from tax losses and credits and deductible temporary differences as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
in the third quarter of fiscal  however  we recorded a full valuation allowance a charge to income to fully reserve against the net deferred tax asset against our deferred tax assets 
we recorded this valuation allowance because the cumulative losses we had incurred over the three years prior to that date and the operating losses we continued to incur made it questionable whether we would realize value from the deferred tax assets and because we fully utilized our loss carryback potential in since the third quarter of fiscal  we have continued to record in each quarter a full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for this valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to use these assets 
at that time  the valuation allowance will be reassessed  and could be eliminated  resulting in the recognition of deferred tax assets 
during  we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 
income earned in will result in our fully utilizing remaining tax operating loss carryforwards with the result that we paid income taxes in because we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets deferred tax assets not available to reduce taxable income or taxes payable in these taxes paid are recorded as an expense  resulting in an effective rate of 
we recorded a tax provision of  in resulting from tax on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
there was no tax benefit recorded on us based operating losses in as the result of establishing a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in we recorded a tax benefit of million in resulting in an effective income tax rate of 
the effective tax rate was substantially lower than the us statutory tax rate of primarily as the result of establishing a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets during the third quarter of the tax benefit and effective income tax benefit rate in were impacted by establishing valuation allowances of approximately million  offsetting deferred tax assets that require future taxable income to be realized 
of the million valuation allowance established in  million represents deferred tax assets established in prior years with the balance reflecting deferred tax assets generated as the result of taxable losses 
interest income and other interest income and other primarily includes interest earned on investments and losses associated with foreign currency translation 
interest income increased during as the result of additional invested funds 
these increases were offset by increased translation losses and other items resulting in a slight decline in interest income and other compared to interest income declined during compared to as a result of declining interest rates on invested funds 
in addition  during  we recorded losses of million on equity method investments related to avanti optics corporation  a related party 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents increased by million during primarily because of million of cash generated from operating activities and approximately million of cash generated from financing activities  offset by the purchase of million of marketable securities  net of maturities of marketable securities  and the purchase of million of capital assets 
our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of maturities of marketable securities and investment of cash balances resulting from those maturities  or from other sources of cash  in addition to marketable securities 
accordingly  we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity 
our combined balances of cash and marketable securities increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  we generated million of cash from operations during cash generated from operations primarily included net income of million  which included million of net non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  provision for inventory obsolescence  foreign deferred taxes and other non cash items  tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of  reduced accounts receivable of  advance customer payments of  and increased accrued expenses of million 
this cash generated more than offset investments in inventory of million and other assets of  as well as reductions in accounts payable of million 
increased accrued expenses are primarily due to increased incentive and warranty accruals during investments in inventory are the result of significantly reduced revenues and order rates during the fourth quarter of  which caused build up in inventory as we aligned production rates with customer order rates 
reduced accounts payable are the result of lower levels of inventory purchases during the fourth quarter as we attempted to bring inventory levels down 
we generated million of cash from operations during we used cash in operations primarily to fund a net loss of million  which included a  gain from a technology transfer and license agreement and million of non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and other non cash items  and to fund a million increase in accounts receivable 
these uses of cash were more than offset by a million reduction in income taxes receivable  a million reduction in inventory and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
reduced income taxes receivable are the result of refunds received during from the carry back of losses to prior year tax returns 
reduced inventory  increased accounts receivable and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses are primarily the result of increased revenue levels during the second half of  as well as focused programs to bring down inventory balances 
we used million of cash in investing activities during compared to using million in changes in the level of investments in marketable securities resulting from the purchases and maturities of those securities used million of cash in and used million of cash in we used approximately million and  of cash for the purchase of fixed assets  capitalized patent costs and the acquisition of a patent license in and  respectively 
in addition  during  we generated  of cash from a technology transfer and license agreement 
we generated approximately million of cash from financing activities during compared to  in cash generated from financing activities represents cash from stock option exercises and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan  offset by  of cash used in for the repurchase of common stock 
at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not believe we are exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we had no material commitments for expenditures as of december  while there were no material commitments  we evaluate investment opportunities that come to our attention and could make a significant commitment in the future 
our cash and equivalents and investments totaled million at december  with this level of cash and cash equivalents  and the fact that we are generating net profits and cash during  we believe that cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future  including contractual obligations discussed below 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
december in s total less than year years after years contractual obligations borrowings non cancelable operating lease obligations   purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations   purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding 
included in the purchase obligations category above are obligations related to purchase orders for inventory purchases under our standard terms and conditions and under negotiated agreements with vendors and utilities 
we expect to receive consideration products or services for these purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent all anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated 
the majority of our products and services are purchased as needed  with no contractual commitment 
consequently  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
related party transactions on april   we loaned million to avanti optics corporation avanti  a company founded by steven k 
case  our chairman  founder and a significant shareholder of cyberoptics 
erwin kelen  one of our directors  also served as director of avanti  was a shareholder in avanti  and was a representative of one of the principal venture capital investors in avanti 
we held approximately of the outstanding capital stock of avanti prior to the loan  which we had acquired in consideration of the contribution of  cash and intellectual property to avanti when avanti was formed 
the loan transaction was approved by our board of directors without the participation of dr 
case or mr 
kelen and only after a determination that the loan was in our best interests 
the loan was represented by a convertible promissory note that bore interest at above the prime rate of interest and was repayable on april   or upon an earlier event of default 
the loan was secured by all of the intellectual property of avanti consisting primarily of rights in united states patents and patent applications in the area of photonics component manufacture  and provided us with the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute manual and semi automated equipment for the assembly of surface mountable optical components that were under development by avanti 
during  we reduced the carrying value of the term loan by  to reflect our equity in the cumulative losses of avanti and to reduce our investment to reflect its net realizable value as of december  in december  we were notified that  as a result of not being able to raise additional third party funding  avanti decided to cease operations and liquidate its remaining assets 
in february  avanti s board of directors and its significant shareholders passed a resolution to cease business operations 
consequently  all of the avanti intellectual property rights were transferred to us under the terms of the loan 
at december   there is no remaining carrying value for the loan 
inflation and foreign currency translation changes in our revenues have resulted primarily because of changes in the level of unit shipments and the relative strength of the worldwide electronics and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
all of our international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
accordingly  although currency fluctuations do not significantly affect our revenue and income per unit  they can influence the price competitiveness of our products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
as a result of the kestra acquisition  we have or have had a sales and software development office located in the uk 
we also opened a sales office in singapore during and china during we do not believe that currency fluctuations will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
sfas no 
r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after july   and companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
sfas no 
r will be effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  and may be adopted under either the modified prospective method or alternative methods  which allow for restatement of prior interim periods or prior years 
we are currently evaluating how we will adopt the standard and the impact of adopting sfas no 
r on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  inventory cost and amendment of arb no 
sfas requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocations of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  income taxes  and restructuring costs 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that we believe have the most effect on our reported financial position and results of operations are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  as of december  allowance for warranty expenses 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the allowance for warranties is  at december  reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if in the future we decide to discontinue sales and marketing of any of our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at december   we had a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of approximately million 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors management considers important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating 
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
annually  we also test for impairment of goodwill by estimating the fair value utilizing several methodologies  including consideration of our market capitalization and discounted cash flows  in determining a reasonable valuation 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
deferred tax assets 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our decision to record this valuation allowance was based on the cumulative losses we had incurred over the three years prior to that date  the fact that we were continuing to generate operating losses and that we fully utilized our loss carryback benefit in from the third quarter of fiscal to date  we have continued to provide a full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for this valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
we expect to continue to provide a full valuation allowance until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
at that time  the valuation allowance will be reassessed  and could be eliminated  resulting in the recognition of deferred tax assets 
as of december  and  our deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance were approximately million and million  respectively 
included in these amounts are deferred tax assets related to our uk subsidiary of approximately million as of december  because of uncertainty as to future realization of these assets  a valuation allowance had been established prior to the third quarter of  and the valuation allowance on these uk based deferred tax assets will continue to be assessed separately 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess funds not required for current operations in marketable securities 
the investment policy for these marketable securities is approved annually by the board of directors and administered by management 
a third party  approved by our board of directors  manages the portfolio at the direction of management 
the investment policy dictates that marketable securities consist of us government or us government agency securities or certain approved corporate instruments with maturities of three years or less and an average portfolio maturity of not more that months 
as of december  our portfolio of marketable securities had an average term to maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
we estimate that a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the market value of the portfolio of marketable securities of approximately  if such a rate increase occurred  our net income would only be impacted if securities were sold prior to maturity 
we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature on the last day of each quarter and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   the company had one open swap agreement that was purchased on that date 
as a result  there were no unrealized gains or losses as of december  during the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of approximately  from settlement of foreign currency swap agreements that offset the approximately  translation gain on the underlying inter company balance 
our foreign currency swap agreements contain credit risk to the extent that our bank counter parties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
the company minimizes such risk by limiting its counter parties to major financial institutions 
we do not expect material losses as a result of defaults by other parties
