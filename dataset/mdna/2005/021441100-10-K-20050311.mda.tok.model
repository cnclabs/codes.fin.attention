item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
our management believes that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and the financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any differences between these judgments and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our statement of income and financial conditions 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates include those regarding revenue recognition  valuation of inventories  and taxes 
revenue recognition we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to oems  or their subcontract manufacturers 
we recognize revenue on products sold to oems upon shipment 
as of december   more than of our products are sold to distributors for subsequent resale to oems or their subcontract manufacturers 
because our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for product returns  price adjustments or  under certain circumstances  other credits  we defer recognition of revenue on products sold to distributors until the products are resold 
deferred revenue and the corresponding deferred cost of sales are recorded in the caption titled deferred income and allowances on sales to distributors in the current liability section of our consolidated balance sheets 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  we use this data and apply judgment in reconciling differences between their reported inventories and activities 
if distributors incorrectly report their inventories or activities  or if our judgment is in error  it could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues and deferred income and net income 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost determined on a first in first out basis approximated by standard cost or market 
we establish provisions for inventory if it is in excess of projected customer demand  and the creation of such provisions results in a write down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to cost of goods sold 
historically  it has been difficult to forecast customer demand especially at the part number level 
many of the orders we receive from our customers and distributors request delivery of product on relatively short notice and with lead times less than our manufacturing cycle time 
in order to provide competitive delivery times to our customers  we build and stock a certain amount of inventory in anticipation of customer demand that may or may not materialize 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  we may allow customers to cancel orders with minimal advance notice 
thus  even product built to satisfy specific customer orders may not ultimately be required to fulfill customer demand 
we routinely compare our inventory against projected demand and record provisions for excess and obsolete inventories as necessary 
however  actual demand may materially differ from our projected demand  and this difference could have a material adverse impact on our gross margin and inventory balances 
taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax liabilities and the determination of net deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition methods 
we record valuation allowances  when necessary  to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that management estimates is more likely than not to be realized 
if in the future we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may be required to be paid as a result of such examinations 
if the payment ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the tax liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result

executive overview company and market overview we are a global semiconductor company and the second largest supplier of high density programmable logic devices plds as measured by market share 
plds are semiconductor integrated circuits that are built as standard chips that customers program to perform desired logic functions within their electronic systems 
our plds consist of field programmable gate arrays  or fpgas  and complex programmable logic devices  or cplds 
we estimate that the pld market was approximately billion in  based on publicly available data 
because of user programmability  we believe plds provide greater advantages in flexibility  development cost  and time to market over fixed chip logic alternatives which currently amount to approximately billion in annual sales  based on publicly available data 
these alternatives include application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and application specific standard products  or assps 
it is generally thought that plds will be increasingly chosen over fixed chip alternatives and semiconductor industry forecasts typically identify plds as one of the fastest growing segments within the semiconductor industry  based on publicly available data 
we design  manufacture  and market high performance  high density plds  hardcopy structured asic devices which provide a fixed function  lower cost migration path for our largest plds  pre defined software design building blocks known as intellectual property  or ip  cores  and associated development tools 
over of our revenue consists of sales of our devices  which are sold to approximately  customers within the communications  computer and storage  industrial  and consumer markets 
the remainder of our sales is made up of ip cores and development tools which are necessary for using our devices 
competing for design wins and general competitive factors because of the general industry trend moving from fixed chip alternatives to plds  the larger pld vendors recently have enjoyed strong  albeit volatile  revenue growth rates and higher levels of profitability and positive cash flows 
despite the attractive business model  two vendors account for a majority of the total pld market ourselves and xilinx inc smaller vendors  including lattice semiconductor corporation and actel corporation  each comprises less than of the pld market 
we believe that higher profit levels and higher market concentration in the pld industry are partly the result of the fact that pld vendors each have a large installed base of software development tools that are proprietary to each vendor and specific to its devices  and the resource intensive process required to achieve design wins 
a design win occurs when a customer selects a particular pld vendor for use in the customer s electronic system 
to achieve a design win success  the technical capability of the respective vendors product offerings primarily devices and design tools is the most significant competitive factor within the pld market 
additional competitive factors that can impact design win success include on time delivery and the ability to train  educate and support customers 
because each vendor s product offering is proprietary  the cost to switch pld devices after a system has been designed and prototyped is very high 
therefore  a design win can provide the pld vendor a predictable and profitable revenue stream through the life of the customer s program 
from the time a design win is secured  it can be as long as two years  and sometimes longer  before the customer starts the volume production of their system 
typically a pld vendor for a particular application is selected relatively early in the customer s design program 
it may take several years from that point before the customer has completed their entire system design  built prototypes  sampled the marketplace for customer acceptance  made any modifications  and established volume manufacturing capacity 
thus  movements in pld market share often occur some time after the change in relative competitiveness that gave rise to the market share shift 
because of this time lag  market share is a lagging indicator of relative competitive strength 
because it is extremely difficult to forecast the degree of success and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements timing of customers programs  and because the end markets are so fragmented there are approximately  pld customers it is difficult even for pld vendors to gauge their own competitive strength in securing design wins as of a particular point in time 
competition in the pld market exists across its two primary product subsegments cplds and fpgas 
generally  cplds and fpgas do not compete directly for the same customer designs based on product differences 
altera was an early entrant in the cpld space and we believe  based on publicly available data  has held market share of more than for more than five years 
we believe  based on publicly available data  that xilinx currently leads the fpga subsegment with more than market share 
due to the higher integration density and lower cost per function  the fpga sub segment has outgrown the cpld sub segment in recent times and it is generally accepted by participants and observers of the industry that this trend will continue 
we believe  based on publicly available data  that we have approximately market share in the fpga sub segment and that maintaining or increasing market share in this growing sub segment is important to our long term growth and profitability 
in review in we saw a period of accelerated revenue growth in the first half of the year followed by an industry correction and period of revenue decline during the second half of the year 
despite the decline during the second half of and the uncertainty as we begin  we were able to achieve some significant milestones 
total revenue grew over to billion in  driven primarily by our new product category which grew in and now comprises of total revenue 
importantly  the stratix family  introduced in may is now our largest family in revenue contribution 
nevertheless it is relatively early in this product s life cycle revenues for new families typically achieve their peak three to five years after the initial ramp 
in order to continue our design win momentum  we announced three new product families during stratix ii  max ii and cyclone ii 
software design tools relating to these new product families were made available to our broad customer base as early as the first quarter of and stratix ii and max ii devices began shipping in the third quarter of with cyclone ii devices to begin shipment in the first quarter of we believe these new device offerings offer significant competitive advantages in many applications that can further our design win momentum and future revenue growth opportunity 
at the same time we believe that xilinx has a secure position in many customers legacy systems and that xilinx will continue to generate revenue from these design wins as long as the customers legacy systems remain in production 
it is difficult to forecast the ramp of new products as they are dependent on our customers end product transitions and market success 
it is also difficult to estimate the rate of growth or decline of revenues attributable to legacy design wins 
the challenges we face in looking ahead into  we are engaged in a critical competitive contest for market share in the pld market 
we believe we have had recent success in securing market share and design wins that may bode well for future growth  but we cannot be certain this is the case nor can we predict with any reliability the rate at which recent design wins may transition into volume production of our products 
our longer term success depends on our ability to execute roll out of our new product families and capitalize on their technical advantages by capturing design wins 
stratix ii and cyclone ii are manufactured on a new leading edge process technology for which our principal foundry vendor  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  has limited experience and for which we have no production experience 
simultaneous introduction of new pld architectures and ramp of new technology processes is inherently risky 
diagnosing failures  identifying root causes  and implementing corrective actions in a production wafer fabrication facility is expensive and time consuming 
there are no assurances that our new products will be successfully commercialized and enable us to gain additional market share 
however  all recent new product roll outs have been on or ahead of schedule 
based on publicly available data  including market forecasts  and recent results for the semiconductor industry and the pld industry in particular  we believe that we are in a period of inventory correction  although one that  we believe  is much smaller in magnitude than experienced in year industry analysts generally believe that the correction will end and an upturn will begin during and the pld industry will experience moderate growth in followed by higher levels of growth in however  we and other participants in the semiconductor industry have historically failed to accurately forecast the turning points in various previous cycles

sfas r addresses all forms of share based payments awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock option  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
in addition  we will be required to record compensation expense as previous awards continue to vest for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption

we are currently evaluating the alternative methods of adoption as described above 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no negative impact on our cash flow 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future

before you decide to buy  hold  or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained elsewhere in this report 
the following risk factors are not the only risk factors facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
our business  financial condition  and results of operation could be seriously harmed if any of the events underlying any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our financial results depend on our ability to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the programmable logic industry is intensely competitive 
our ability to compete successfully in the industry will depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  and sell complex semiconductor components and development tools that offer customers greater value than solutions offered by competing vendors such as xilinx and lattice 
because we develop plds for applications that are presently served by vendors of asics  assps  microcontrollers  and digital signal processors  we also indirectly compete against vendors of these products 
many of these vendors  including international business machines corporation and texas instruments inc  have substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do and have well established market positions and solutions that have been proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades 
we may not be able to displace these vendors in the targeted applications and densities 
further  other programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be successful in securing market share from us 
moreover  some of our customers have historically used standard cell technologies to achieve greater integration in their systems  this may not only impede our efforts to penetrate the markets for asics  assps  microcontrollers  and digital signal processors  but may also displace our products in the applications that we presently serve 
our future success depends on our ability to define  develop  and manufacture technologically advanced products as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapid technological change 
the manufacture of our products is a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a highly controlled environment 
our current product development efforts focus on developing new plds  related development software and hardware  and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes 
our development efforts may not result in the timely introduction of competitive new products  or enhancements to existing products 
additionally  we may not be successful in developing new products using  and converting established products to  new and more advanced process technologies 
for example  our stratix  stratix gx and cyclone families are manufactured on a nanometer  all layer copper interconnect process 
the company s next generation product families  the stratix ii and cyclone ii families  are manufactured on a nanometer all layer copper interconnect process for which altera has limited production history 
we will continue to transition our fabrication process arrangements to smaller circuit geometries and our plds manufactured on a nanometer process have recently transitioned from mm to mm wafer sizes 
the use of advanced process technology entails inherent technological risks and start up difficulties that can adversely affect r d spending  yields  product costs  and timeliness of delivery

we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers 
nearly all of our silicon wafers are produced by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  and its subsidiary  wafertech llc  in their manufacturing facilities located in taiwan and the state of washington  respectively 
the remaining portion of our silicon wafers are produced by sharp corporation in japan 
silicon wafer production facilities have at any given time a fixed capacity  the allocation of which is determined solely by our vendors and over which we have no direct control 
we have no formalized long term supply or allocation commitments from our foundry suppliers 
if market demand for silicon wafers suddenly exceeds market supply  our supply of silicon wafers could quickly become limited 
a shortage in foundry manufacturing capacity could hinder our ability to meet demand for our products 
moreover  silicon wafers constitute more than half of our product cost 
if we are unable to procure wafers at favorable prices  our gross margins will be adversely affected 
to ensure the continued supply of wafers  we may establish other sources of wafer supply for our products as such arrangements become economically advantageous or technically necessary 
however  there are only a few foundry vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture our products 
if we engage alternative sources of supply with foundry vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture our products  we may encounter start up difficulties and incur additional costs 
also  shipments could be delayed significantly while such sources are qualified for volume production 
in addition to sufficient foundry manufacturing capacity and wafer prices  we depend on good production yields good die per wafer  and timely delivery of silicon wafers to meet our customers demand for products and to maintain profit margins 
wafer production yields depend on a wide variety of factors  including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
as is common in the semiconductor industry  we have experienced  and may experience from time to time  problems with achieving acceptable production yields and timely delivery from our foundry vendors 
difficulties in production yields can often occur when we begin production of new products  when we transition to new processes  or when our principal wafer supplier  tsmc  moves production of a product from one manufacturing plant to another  or manufactures the same product at multiple factories 
further  production throughput times vary considerably among the various factories used by our wafer suppliers  and we may experience delays from time to time in processing some of our products 
these difficulties and delays can potentially result in significantly higher costs and lower product availability 
we depend on independent subcontractors  located in asia  to assemble and test our semiconductor products 
independent subcontractors  located in asia  assemble and test our semiconductor products 
because we rely on independent subcontractors to perform these services  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules or quality levels 
our future success also depends on the financial viability of our independent subcontractors 
if the capital structures of our independent subcontractors weaken  we may experience product shortages  quality assurance problems  increased manufacturing costs  and or supply chain disruption 
conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors and distributors may impact their business operations 
the economic  market  social  and political situations in countries where certain independent subcontractors and distributors are located are unpredictable  can be volatile  and can have a significant impact on our business because we may not be able to obtain or distribute product in a timely manner 
market and political conditions  including currency fluctuation  terrorism  political strife  war  labor disruption  and other factors  including natural or man made disasters  adverse changes in tax laws  tariff  import or export quotas  power and water shortages  or interruption in air transportation  in areas where our independent subcontractors and distributors are located also could have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities

index to financial statements our intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful protection from our competitors 
we rely significantly on patents to protect our intellectual property rights 
we have increased investment in intellectual property protection in the last several years and  as of december   we owned more than united states and foreign patents 
we also have a significant number of patent applications pending 
our patents and patent applications may not provide meaningful protection from our competitors as the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions  and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain 
our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents or develop new patentable technologies that displace our existing products 
in addition to patent protection  we rely on trademark  trade secret  copyright  and mask work laws to protect our unpatented proprietary information or technologies 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  third parties  including our former employees or consultants  may attempt to disclose  obtain  or use our proprietary information or technologies without our authorization 
if other companies obtain our proprietary information or technologies or develop substantially equivalent information or technologies  they may develop products that compete against our products 
moreover  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and may result in significant expense to us and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
even if we spend significant resources and efforts to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
use by others of our proprietary rights could materially harm our business and expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we are at risk of intellectual property infringement claims by third parties 
from time to time in the normal course of business  we receive inquiries with respect to possible patent infringements 
as a result of inquiries received from third parties  it may be necessary or desirable for us to obtain licenses relating to one or more of our current or future products 
we may not be able to obtain such licenses on reasonable terms 
additionally  if we are sued for patent infringement  the costs and outcome of such litigation could be unpredictable and could have a negative impact on our financial results 
intellectual property claims  regardless of their merit  can result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
legal proceedings also tend to be unpredictable and may be affected by events outside of our control 
if we are unsuccessful in defending against third party intellectual property infringement claims  third parties may obtain significant monetary damages or an injunction against the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product families 
alternatively  we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  the success of which may be uncertain 
we cannot assure you that intellectual property litigation will not have an adverse effect on our financial position  or results of operations or cash flows 
we may incur warranty related liabilities 
we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship and non conformance to our specifications for varying lengths of time 
if there is a material increase in customer claims compared with our historical experience  or if costs of servicing warranty claims are greater than expected  we may record a charge against future cost of sales and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
as we continue to expand our sales into new areas such as automotive  military  aerospace  avionics  and medical equipment applications where our devices are used in systems that could cause damage to property or persons if those systems were to fail  we may be subject to claims of product liability if our devices are the cause of such system failures 
based on our historical experience  we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low 
however  if the volume of our sales into such applications increases  we may face increased exposure

index to financial statements we depend on distributors to generate sales and fulfill our customer orders 
worldwide sales through distributors accounted for more than of our total sales during we rely on many distributors to assist us in creating customer demand  providing technical support and other value added services to our customers  filling customer orders  and stocking our products 
our contracts with our distributors may be terminated by either party in a relatively short period of time 
our distributors are located all over the world and are of various sizes and financial conditions 
lower sales  lower earnings  debt downgrades  the inability to access capital markets  and higher interest rates could potentially impact our distributors operations 
we are highly dependent on arrow electronics  inc  in many locations across the world  particularly in north america 
during  arrow on a worldwide basis accounted for approximately of sales  and our next largest distributors accounted for approximately and of sales  respectively 
at december   three distributors  each of which accounted for more than of total accounts receivable  accounted for   and of total accounts receivable 
our distributors have sole authority to accept returns from end customers in the ordinary course of business 
because we recognize revenue when distributors sell product to end customers  returns from end customers to our distributors reduce our reported sales 
we have no direct control over our distributors policies or practices on accepting customer returns and may have no forewarning of significant customer returns 
consequently  large returns could have an unexpected material adverse impact on our sales 
the length of our design in and sales cycle could impact our future sales 
our sales depend on our products being designed into our end customers products and those products achieving volume production 
our products are very complex in nature  and the time from design in to volume production ranges from months to years 
from initial product design in to volume production  many factors could impact the timing and or amount of sales actually realized from the design in 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in the competitive position of our technology  the competitiveness of our customers products in the markets they serve  our customers financial stability  and our ability to ship products according to our customers schedule 
we depend on international sales for a majority of our total sales 
during each of the last three years  international sales were a majority of our total sales 
during  international sales constituted approximately of our total sales 
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales 
risks related to our foreign operations include unfavorable economic  market  political  and social conditions in a specific country or region  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates  adverse changes in tax laws  increased freight costs  interruptions in air transportation  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  generally longer receivable collection periods  and natural or man made disasters in a specific country or region where we sell our products 
our business is also subject to the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the importation or exportation of semiconductor products 
quotas  duties  tariffs  taxes  or other charges  restrictions  or trade barriers may be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the importation or exportation of our products in the future 
our business is subject to tax risks associated with being a multinational corporation 
as a multinational corporation  we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions 
the application of tax law is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty and tax laws themselves are subject to change 
consequently  taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could result in a significant charge to earnings relating to prior periods and or an increase in our effective income tax rate

index to financial statements our gross margins are subject to fluctuations due to many factors 
our gross margins may fluctuate depending on many factors  including  but not limited to  our product mix  market acceptance of our new products  competitive pricing dynamics  geographic and or market segment pricing strategies  and various manufacturing cost variables  including product yields  wafer prices and absorption of manufacturing overhead 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  which means that semiconductor companies such as altera experience significant fluctuations in sales and profitability 
during  the semiconductor industry was significantly impacted by the economic downturn and contraction in the computing and communication equipment markets and by the ensuing inventory correction in the supply chain for those industries 
this down cycle  like many of the preceding down cycles  resulted in significant reductions in unit demand  excess customer inventories  price erosion  and excess production capacity 
we experienced five consecutive declines in quarterly sales beginning in the fourth quarter of and ending in the fourth quarter of the protracted deceleration resulted in a peak to trough decline in quarterly sales of nearly 
in addition to reductions in sales  our profitability decreases during downturns as we are unable to reduce our expenses at the same rate as our sales decline 
for example  at the height of the previous upcycle  in the third quarter of  our operating expenses were less than of sales compared to almost in the first quarter of similarly  our gross margins tend to deteriorate and fluctuate during down cycles 
for example  in the third quarter of  our reported gross margin was over of sales compared to of sales in the first quarter of furthermore  the industry contraction during was prolonged and severe and resulted in an inventory provision of million in relating primarily to the write off of inventories in excess of projected demand 
additionally  as a result of reduced demand and in an effort to reduce our ongoing expense levels  we incurred restructuring charges and write downs totaling million in in the year ended december   our net income was million on sales of billion whereas for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million on sales of million 
we expect that our future sales and profitability will continue to be volatile 
in an effort to reduce the possibility of future provision for excess inventory  we reduced our inventory carrying targets in reductions in targeted inventory carrying levels may result in poorer delivery performance relative to our customers desired lead times  which over time may erode our competitive position and result in a loss of market share 
despite our intent to operate with lower inventory levels  we are likely to experience inventory write downs in the future  especially if our inventory becomes out of mix with  or excess to  customer demand 
we carry only limited insurance coverages 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset the losses resulting from covered incidents 
additionally  we do not have coverage for certain losses

index to financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of billion as of december  and billion as of january  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will vary in value as market interest rates fluctuate 
if market interest rates were to increase or decline immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the increase or decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
although we purchase the majority of our materials and services in us dollars and sell our products to oems and distributors in us dollars  we do have international operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has been insignificant 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december   our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
however  we cannot assure you that there will not be a material impact in the future
