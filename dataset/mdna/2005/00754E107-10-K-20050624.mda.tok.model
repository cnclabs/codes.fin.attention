item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation application of critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make certain judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts could be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  warranty costs  taxes and contingencies 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and or as areas most dependent on management s judgment and estimates 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 we recognize revenue from the sale of products when the products are shipped to the customer 
revenues from the sale of services consist of non recurring engineering charges  which are recognized when the services have been rendered 
historically  sales returns have amounted to less than of net income and all sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts 
impairment of long lived assets we continually review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
we also review long lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
upon such an occurrence  recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows to which the assets relate  to the carrying amount 
if the asset is determined to be unable to recover its carrying value  then intangible assets  if any  are written down first  followed by the other long lived assets to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  appraised values or management s estimates  depending on the nature of the assets 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record a deferred tax asset in jurisdictions where we generate a loss for income tax purposes 
for all years prior to fiscal  due to our history of operating losses  we had recorded a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  because  in management s judgment  the deferred tax assets would not be realized in the foreseeable future 
in fiscal years and  the company returned to a position of continued profitability 
based on recent profit history and on anticipated future profits resulting from the company s acquisition and merger with picometrix  inc in may  we reversed a portion of the valuation allowance for the year ended march   because  in our estimation  we believe that at least of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible  and no assurance can be given that the company will  in fact  generate future taxable income in amounts sufficient to fully realize the asset 
we have considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making our assessment 
the deferred tax assets are evaluated annually and the valuation allowance may be adjusted again in the future years if it is determined that any additional portion of the assets will or will not be realized 
inventories our inventories are stated at standard cost which approximates the first in  first out method or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventories are analyzed quarterly 
to calculate a reserve for obsolescence  we begin with a review of our slow moving inventory 
any inventory which has not moved within the past months is reserved for at of book value  inventory which has not moved within the past months is reserved for at 
the percentages applied to the reserve calculation are based on historical usage analyses 
in addition  any residual inventory which is customer specific and remaining on hand at the time of contract completion is reserved for at the standard unit cost 
the complete list of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reviewed by the production  engineering and or purchasing departments to identify items that can be utilized in the near future 
these items are then excluded from the analysis and the remaining amount of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reserved for 
additionally  non cancelable open purchase orders for parts we are obligated to purchase where demand has been reduced may be reserved 
reserves for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price are also established 
if a product which had previously been reserved for is subsequently sold  the amount of reserve specific to that item is then reversed 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established by analyzing each account that has a balance over days past due 
each account is individually assigned a probability of collection 
the total amount determined to be uncollectible in the days past due category is then reserved fully 
the percentage of this reserve to the days past due total is then established as a guideline and applied to the rest of the non current accounts receivable balance where appropriate 
when other circumstances suggest that a receivable may not be collectible  it is immediately reserved for  even if the receivable is not yet in the days past due category 
table of contractual obligations the following table sets forth the contractual obligations of the company at march  contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt   capital lease obligations    operating lease obligations    purchase obligations   other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total    results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues the company s revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were million  an increase of million  or from revenues of million for the fiscal year ended march  
approximately  of the increase was attributable to revenues from photonic detectors  inc pdi  which the company acquired in december the remaining increase reflects an overall increase in shipments to customers in each of the company s major market segments over the prior year 
as has been the trend for most of the current fiscal year  the most significant revenue increases are coming from the medical and industrial sensing segments  which increased by and respectively over the prior year and account for million of the total increase 
similarly  sales to the military aerospace and automotive markets have also increased  by and respectively  and account for approximately  of the remaining increase in net revenues 
stated as a percentage of net revenues  sales to the industrial sensing markets represent  sales to the military aerospace markets represent  medical is and automotive is 
as expected  the increased diversification and larger customer base achieved through the company s previous acquisitions resulted in net revenues which fully met our expectations for the most recent fiscal year 
during the upcoming year  we expect to see continued revenue growth in our core silicon business  as well as a significant revenue increase resulting from our acquisition of picometrix  inc which occurred in may as such  in fiscal  we expect total revenues to increase by over fiscal costs and expenses cost of product sales increased to million in from million in stated as percent of net sales  cost of product sales increased percentage points to  reducing our gross profit margin to in as compared to in fiscal year the reduction in gross margin is primarily attributable to manufacturing issues  including labor inefficiencies and a significant increase in material costs related to scrap  rework and assembly yields 
stated as a percentage of net sales  material costs rose to in as compared to in in  we were again faced with heightened competitiveness in certain markets which caused us to absorb increases in certain material costs while maintaining or reducing existing pricing in our efforts to generate new business as well as retain existing business 
direct labor and other overhead expenses as a percentage of net sales remained flat at and  respectively  in as compared to while our gross margins fell slightly short of our expectations for  we are continually seeking ways to improve our cost and margin structure  and have made margin improvement a continued priority for research and development r d costs decreased by  to  during compared to  in r d costs decreased significantly over the past two years as we concentrated our efforts on projects offering the highest commercial potential per each dollar spent

marketing and sales expenses increased by  to million in planned additions to the sales department staff during the year accounted for  of increased salary  travel and related expenses

total general and administrative expenses increased by  to million in as compared to million in approximately of the increase in general and administrative expenses is due to increased personnel and related expenses  including salaries  bonuses and benefits to support our growth objectives 
in addition  total payroll was increased during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a direct result of the pdi acquisition  which was consummated on december  as part of our integration plan  selected pdi personnel were either offered a permanent position or requested to remain as an employee until a date specified by the company 
the net effect of the additional pdi personnel accounted for approximately  of the year to date increase 
the remaining increases in general and administrative expenses were primarily due to acquisition investigation and related expenses  including consultants  legal  financing and other related expenses  which amounted to approximately  in total 
in the upcoming year  general and administrative expenses will increase as needed to provide the infrastructure necessary to support the company s growth objectives interest income for totaled  an increase of  over  due primarily to capital financing activities which resulted in higher cash balances available for short term investment 
interest expense for the year was  as compared to  in  also a result of capital financing activities and the related interest liabilities 
at march   the company reversed of its deferred tax valuation allowance  in the amount of  the deferred tax valuation allowance had previously been recorded at full value against its deferred tax assets  reducing the net value of the asset to zero 
with the acquisition of both photonic detectors inc in december and picometrix  inc 
in may  the company s management has projected that the company will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize at least a portion of its accumulated nol s before they expire and has accordingly reduced the deferred tax asset valuation allowance to million against a deferred tax asset of million  bringing the net value of the deferred tax asset to million at march  the reduction in the valuation allowance has been recorded as a deferred tax benefit in the statement of operations 
net income for fiscal year was million  including the million adjustment made to reduce the deferred tax valuation allowance  as compared to  in total acquisition related expenses for fiscal year which were necessary to support our growth objectives amounted to  which includes interest expense of  plus the  increased general and administrative expenses associated with pdi and other acquisition investigation activities  as noted above 
thus  excluding the net impact of the deferred tax asset adjustment and acquisition related expenses  net income for fiscal would have been million  or per share 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues the company s revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were million  an increase of million  or  from revenues of million for the fiscal year ended march  
the increase was primarily attributable to the company s acquisitions of silicon sensors  inc and texas optoelectronics  inc  both of which occurred during fiscal the increase in net product sales reflects significant increases in shipments to customers in each of the company s major market segments  the most notable coming from the military aerospace segments  which increased over the prior year and represent of total revenues  or million 
similarly  sales to the industrial sensing segments increased over the prior year and represent of total revenues  or million 
sales to the medical markets  representing of total revenues  increased to million  and sales to the automotive segment  which are directly attributable to the texas optoelectronics  inc acquisition  increased to  and represent of total revenues  as compared to  representing of total revenues in fiscal year revenues fell somewhat short of expectations because of changes in customer delivery schedules and other manufacturing issues 
nonetheless  we are pleased with the market stability and increased diversification that has been achieved as a result of our acquisitions and consolidation of the three companies 
costs and expenses cost of product sales increased to million in from million in stated as percent of net sales  cost of product sales decreased percentage points to  bringing gross profit margin to in as compared to in fiscal year the improvement in gross margin is primarily attributable to a reduction in material costs which decreased to as compared to in the prior year 
in addition  margins benefited from the consolidation of the company s acquired businesses and steps taken by the company to maximize production efficiencies between its two facilities  including load and inventory sharing  inventory reduction plans  and other cost management techniques 
direct labor as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat at in as compared to in  as did other fixed and variable overhead expenses  which amounted to for compared to in the company continually seeks ways to improve gross margin  and expects that the current margin of is indicative of what can be expected in the future  given the current operational structure 
research and development r d costs decreased by  to  during compared to  in r d costs have fluctuated significantly over the past two years as we have restructured and refocused our efforts 
during  the company discontinued projects which did not have a clearly identified customer demand in our current market segments
