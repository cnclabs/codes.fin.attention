results of operations overview net income for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the year of the increase in net income in is primarily due to a lower loan loss provision  as a result of decreasing non performing loans 
the provision for loan losses decreased million  or  to million from million during non performing loans decreased to million from million at december  net interest income decreased million from million in to million in  partially offsetting the lower loan loss provision 
total non interest income of million for  excluding securities gains  was relatively unchanged from non interest expense decreased from million in to million in due to reorganization costs of  in performance ratios for included a return on assets of and a return on equity of  compared to and  respectively  in net income for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the year of the decrease in net income from to is due to primarily two factors

and a return on equity of compared to 
and  respectively  in net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  is the most significant component of the company s earnings 
net interest income is affected by changes in the volumes  rates and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

net interest income decreased million  or  from million in to million in net interest margin decreased from in to in interest income on loans decreased million  or  from  and the yield on average loans decreased from in to in  despite an increase in average loans of million 
although the prime rate increased approximately basis points from june to december  approximately of the company s adjustable rate loan portfolio reprices off the three and five year treasury rates 
these treasury rates remained lower in than the previous repricing rates  resulting in a decrease in the yield earned on adjusting loans 
in addition  interest income on securities decreased million from million in to million in the average securities balance declined million in  primarily due to the use of proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities to pay down approximately million in fhlb debt 
the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities only decreased million from million in to million in the yield on interest bearing deposits declined basis points from in to in as certificate of deposits matured and repriced at lower rates 
rates on short term borrowings  are directly tied to the prime rate 
as a result  short term borrowing costs increased during the last six months of the yields on fhlb borrowings increased from in to in  as lower rate advances were paid off  and higher rate advances remained outstanding 
based on the current rate environment  management expects these advances to have a negative impact on earnings for several years 
net interest income decreased million  or  from million in to million in net interest margin decreased from in to in as interest rates remained at historical lows during  the interest income on interest earning assets decreased million from million in to million in the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  however  decreased only million from million in to million in this decrease is primarily the result of a mismatch in interest rate risk between investments and fhlb borrowings 

table of contents historically at various times  the bank has utilized fhlb borrowings to purchase securities  leverage its capital position and improve earnings 
with the decrease in rates during  however  higher yielding mortgage related and callable securities prepaid and were reinvested at lower yields 
as a result  interest on securities decreased  or million in from  and the yield decreased basis points from to 
the average balance of the securities portfolio decreased million  or  from  due to the prepayments and a shifting of balances from mortgage related securities to mortgage loans 
unfortunately  interest expense on fhlb borrowings did not decrease 
these borrowings have fixed rates and are subject to significant prepayment penalties 
interest expense on fhlb borrowings increased to million in from million in and the average cost decreased to in from in due to additional average borrowings of million during and no repricing of prior years outstanding fhlb borrowings 
interest income on loans decreased million from million in to million in while the yield decreased to in from  an increase in average loans of million partially offset the decrease in yield 
interest expense on deposits and short term borrowings decreased million  or  in compared to this decrease was due to a combination of lower average costs  average balances and mix of deposits 
average interest bearing deposits and short term borrowings decreased million  or  during  while the cost decreased from in to in the volume growth in average deposits and short term interest bearing liabilities was due to a million  or  increase in now and money market accounts  and a million  or  increase in savings deposits  offset by a decrease in average certificates of deposits of million 
net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense

total non interest income was million in  million in  and million in trust income increased in and decreased in  which was a function of the decline and subsequent increase in the average market value of funds under management 
service charges and fees have increased over the last three years due to increased charges and growth in the number of accounts

atm network fees generated were  in   in  and  in at the end of  there were thirty two machines installed in three states compared to forty seven machines installed at the end of and sixty five at the end of the decrease in machines installed and fees generated is a result of increased competition in the atm network business and the company s decision not to expand this line of business due to lower profit margins and higher machine upgrade expenses 
insurance agency commission income increased from  in to  in due to increased commissions from acquired agencies and remained relatively unchanged at  in  mainly due to a decline in annuity sales

in  salary expense was down approximately  largely due to a reduction in staffing in the fourth quarter of and the closing of three offices in january this decrease was offset by payment of bonuses in the decrease in expense in is primarily due to elimination of officer bonuses  offset by an increase in health care costs and other retirement expenses 
the average number of full time equivalent employees was in  in and in the operations center which opened in april contributed to the increase in occupancy from to equipment expense declined from million in to million in  primarily due to the bank s conversion to a new processing system in april where the annual maintenance fees were waived for the first year 
data processing expenses increased from  in to  in and  in  largely a result of increasing debit card processing expense 
professional fees increased from to  primarily due to legal fees associated with loan collection efforts and third party loan review 
other noninterest expenses increased to million in primarily due to  in reorganization expenses 
on october   the company announced it was undertaking several initiatives designed to lower the company s non interest expense by closing three of its banking offices and reducing its workforce

effective july   the company reclassified its held to maturity securities as available for sale 
historically  the held to maturity portfolio contained both out of state and ohio municipal securities which were used to meet state of ohio public fund pledging requirements and provide non taxable income for the company 
as a result of a change in the ohio revised code  the state of ohio public fund pledging requirements eliminated out of state municipals as eligible collateral 
because of this change  approximately of the held to maturity portfolio could not be used as originally intended

commercial and industrial loans declined from million in to million in and million in the decline in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio has been largely offset by an increase in commercial real estate and real estate construction loans 
the company has experienced an increase in its commercial real estate and construction lending over the past five years  because of the company s sales activities in the higher growth clermont and warren counties 
the company continues to focus its commercial lending on small to medium sized companies with established track records in its market area 
residential real estate loans increased million in and declined million in in and continuing in  the company maintained shorter term fixed rate real estate loans for its portfolio and sold the majority of the long term fixed rate residential real estate loans originated

market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to interest rate risk  exchange rate risk  equity price risk and commodity price risk 
the company does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument  and is not currently subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk  equity price risk or commodity price risk 
the company s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the company s board of directors approves the guidelines established by alco 
the primary goal of the asset liability management function is to maximize net interest income within the interest rate risk limits set by alco 
interest rate risk is monitored on a quarterly basis through alco meetings 
techniques used include both interest rate gap management and simulation modeling that measures the effect of rate changes on net interest income and market value of equity under different rate scenarios 
the interest rate gap analysis schedule table quantifies the static asset liability rate sensitivity as of december  for the bank only 
as shown  the bank was asset sensitive for periods zero through one year and one to five years and liability sensitive within the over five year period 
asset sensitive means the bank 
table of contents has more earning assets with the potential to change rate than interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  liability sensitive means the bank has more interest bearing liabilities with the potential to change rate than earning assets 
the cumulative gap as a percent of total assets through one year at the end of was a positive compared to a positive at the end of the balances of transaction type now and mmda accounts are scheduled to run off over their expected lives 
although the entire balance of these deposits is subject to repricing or withdrawal in a relatively short period of time  they have been a stable base of retail core deposits for the bank 
also  historically their sensitivity to changes in interest rates has been significantly less than some other deposits  such as certificates of deposit 
the bank estimates the repricing periods for now  savings and mmdas using guidance available from industry historical measures 
however  considering today s low interest rate environment  the future rate sensitivity of these deposits could be significantly different 
table interest rate gap analysis in thousands at december  report grouping months months months years over years total loans securities short term funds boli total earning assets savings  now mmda other time deposits long term debt total interest bearing funds period gap cumulative gap gap as a percent of assets in the company s simulation models  each asset and liability balance is projected over a one year horizon 
net interest income is then projected based on expected cash flows and projected interest rates under a stable rate scenario and analyzed on a quarterly basis 
the results of this analysis are used in decisions made concerning pricing strategies for loans and deposits  balance sheet mix  securities portfolio strategies  liquidity and capital adequacy 
the company s current one year simulation models under stable rates indicate a relatively flat yield on interest earning assets and an increasing cost of interest bearing liabilities 
this position could have a slightly negative effect on projected net interest margin over the next twelve months 
simulation models are also performed under an instantaneous parallel basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the model includes assumptions as to repricing and expected prepayments  anticipated calls  and expected decay rates of transaction accounts under the different rate scenarios 
the results of these simulations include changes in both net interest income and market value of equity 
alco guidelines that measure interest rate risk by the percent of change from stable rates  and capital adequacy  have been established  and as table indicates at december   the results of basis points increase simulations are within those guidelines  however  the results of the and basis points decrease simulations exceeded those guidelines 
interest rates have declined to historically low levels 
as a result  many of the bank s deposits are within basis points of a zero interest rate floor  and the bank s inability to reduce rates below the zero floor could negatively impact the bank s future earnings and market value of equity 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the simulation modeling 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market rates 
in addition  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and early withdrawals from certificates of deposit may deviate significantly from those assumed in making the risk calculations 
the company s rate shock simulation models provide results 
table of contents in extreme interest rate environments and results are used accordingly 
reacting to changes in economic conditions  interest rates and market forces  the company has been able to alter the mix of short and long term loans and investments  and increase or decrease the emphasis on fixed and variable rate products in response to changing market conditions 
by managing the interest rate sensitivity of its asset composition in this manner  the company has been able to maintain a flow of net interest income less volatile than the rate shock simulation models predicted 
table rate shock analysis one year net interest income change economic value of equity change rate shock year end year end alco guideline year end year end alco guideline impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of a financial institution s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a greater degree than inflation 
although interest rates are determined in large measure by changes in the general level of inflation  they do not change at the same rate or in the same magnitude  but rather react in correlation to changes in expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates has a significant impact on financial results 
as discussed previously  management attempts to control interest rate sensitivity in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions and are integral to the understanding of reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective  or complex 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses each quarter based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  collateral values  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and historical loss experience 
the allowance recorded for homogeneous consumer loans is based on an analysis of loan mix  risk characteristics of the portfolio  and historical losses  adjusted for current trends  for each homogeneous category or group of loans 
the allowance for loan losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans  or the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger non homogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogenous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of risk associated with the commercial and consumer allowance levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 

table of contents goodwill and other intangibles the company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas goodwill is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight line and accelerated methods  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired asset will perform in the future 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  customer attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  specific industry conditions and changes in competition 
effect of recent accounting standards impairment of securities the financial accounting standards board issued eitf issue the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investment in but has delayed its effective date until further guidance as to its application is approved 
as a result  two proposed fasb staff positions have been issued proposed fsp eitf issue a  which provides guidance for the recognition of impairment due to interest rate and or sector spread increases  and proposed fsp issue b  which delays the effective date of eitf issue until further guidance is provided  the company is uncertain as to the impact these issuances will have on its financial statements
