the nominal average maturity of the overall bond portfolio  including collateralized mortgage obligations and short term cash investments  was years at december   which reflects a heavier portfolio mix in investment grade tax exempt revenue and municipal bonds 
the call adjusted average maturity of the overall bond 
table of contents portfolio was shorter  approximately years  because holdings are heavily weighted with high coupon issues that are expected to be called prior to maturity 
the modified duration of the overall bond portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls was years at december   including collateralized mortgage obligations with modified durations of approximately years and short term cash investments that carry no duration 
modified duration measures the length of time it takes  on average  to receive the present value of all the cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest 
because it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms  which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a much better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
the longer the duration  the greater the price volatility in relation to changes in interest rates 
equity holdings consist of perpetual preferred stocks and dividend bearing common stocks on which dividend income is partially tax sheltered by the corporate dividend exclusion 
at year end  short term cash investments consisted of highly rated short duration securities redeemable on a daily or weekly basis

the insurance industry consists of a large number of companies  many of which operate in more than one state  offering automobile  homeowners and commercial property insurance  as well as insurance coverage in other lines 
many of the company s competitors 
table of contents have larger volumes of business and greater financial resources than the company 
based on the most recent regularly published statistical compilations of premiums written  the company in was the third largest writer of private passenger automobile insurance in california 
all of the company s competitors having greater shares of the california market sell insurance through exclusive agents  rather than through independent agents and brokers 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  characterized by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity soft market 
in management s view  and were periods of very good results for companies underwriting automobile insurance 
as a result  many competitors have recently begun reducing rates and increasing advertising expenditures 
the company expects this to continue in and consequently the premium growth rate will likely decline from the levels seen in and 
price and reputation for service are the principal means by which the company competes with other automobile insurers 
the company believes that it has a good reputation for service  and it has  historically  been among the lowest priced insurers doing business in california according to surveys conducted by the california doi 
in addition to good service and competitive pricing  for those insurers dealing through independent agents or brokers  as the company does  the marketing efforts of agents and brokers is also a means of competition 
all rates charged by private passenger automobile insurers are subject to the prior approval of the california doi

the new treaty  which covers commercial property and homeowners  provides first layer coverage of  in excess of  for each risk  second layer coverage of  in excess of  per risk and third layer coverage of  in excess of  per risk 
the swiss re treaty was terminated on a cut off basis meaning that swiss re will remain liable for losses occurring prior to the date of termination

prior to may  the treaty was on a quota share basis and provided million coverage in excess of million for each risk 
effective may   the treaty was replaced with a quota share agreement for umbrella policies with coverage amounts up to but not exceeding million 
effective october   the umbrella coverage was terminated 
the company has chosen to end the treaty on a run off basis meaning that the treaty will remain active for one year after the termination date with policies incepting september  and prior being covered per the treaty terms 
policies incepting on october  and after will not have any reinsurance coverage 
at december   the company did not maintain catastrophe insurance but has determined that such coverage is warranted for certain coverages written in florida and georgia 
effective april   the company expects to enter into a property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement that will cover all property and automobile physical damage comprehensive peril only coverages in those two states 
the treaty is with a group of reinsurers and lloyd s underwriters and has two layers 
the first layer provides coverage of  in excess 
table of contents of  and the second layer is for  in excess of  for all layers  the company will retain of the limit 
policies written in all other states do not have catastrophe coverage  as the company believes it has adequate capitalization to absorb catastrophe losses in those states 
the company periodically reviews its requirements for catastrophic reinsurance particularly in areas that are prone to catastrophes 
for california  the company has reduced its catastrophe exposure from earthquakes due to the placement of earthquake risks  written in conjunction with california homeowners policies  with the california earthquake authority 
see regulation california earthquake authority 
although the company s catastrophe exposure to earthquakes has been reduced  the company continues to have catastrophe exposure for fire following an earthquake 
erc reinsures ami through working layer treaties for property and casualty losses in excess of  up to million 
ami has other reinsurance treaties and facultative arrangements in place for various smaller lines of business 
mcm maintains reinsurance treaties with several different reinsurers covering policies prior to january  the company also holds a formal guarantee from erc which reimburses mcm if any of the reinsurers fail to satisfy their obligations under their respective reinsurance agreements 
if any reinsurers are unable to perform their obligations under the reinsurance treaty  the company will be required  as primary insurer  to discharge all obligations to its insureds in their entirety 
regulation the company s business in california is subject to regulation and supervision by the california doi  which has broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers 
the powers of the california doi primarily include the prior approval of insurance rates and rating factors  the establishment of capital and surplus requirements and standards of solvency  restrictions on dividend payments and transactions with affiliates 
the regulations of and supervision by the california doi are designed principally for the benefit of policyholders and not for insurance company shareholders 
the california doi s market conduct division is responsible for conducting periodic examinations of companies to ensure compliance with the california insurance code and the california code of regulations with respect to rating  underwriting and claims handling practices 
the most recent examination covered a compliance review of the activities of the company s special investigation unit commencing in october the report on the examination is pending finalization by the california doi 
in february  the california doi issued a notice of non compliance nnc to the california companies based on the trial court ruling in the robert krumme litigation 
the nnc alleges that the california companies willfully misrepresented the actual price insurance consumers could expect to pay for insurance by the amount of a one time fee charged by the consumer s insurance broker 
the california companies filed a notice of defense which is based on the same grounds that formed the company s defense in the robert krumme case 
the administrative proceeding has been stayed at the california doi s request until a resolution is reached on the robert krumme case 
settlement negotiations have commenced in order to resolve the matter  including reimbursement of costs to the doi and the payment of a monetary penalty 
no specific discussions have taken place regarding the amount of any monetary penalty  except that the doi has indicated that a monetary penalty would be required 
the company does not believe that it has done anything to warrant a monetary penalty from the california doi 
the company is unable to estimate the ultimate amount of the monetary penalty therefore no adjustment for the potential monetary penalty is recorded in the financial statements 
see item legal proceedings 
the insurance companies outside california are subject to the regulatory powers of the dois of the various states in which they operate 
those powers are similar to the regulatory powers in california enumerated above 
generally  the regulations relate primarily to standards of solvency and are designed for the benefit of policyholders and not of insurance company shareholders 

table of contents in california  georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania and nevada  insurance rates require prior approval from the state doi  while illinois  texas  virginia  arizona and michigan only require that rates be filed with the doi 
oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
persistency discounts predate the proposition rate regulations 
they represent discounts on policy rates extended to consumers based on the number of consecutive years insurance coverage has existed 
in  in response to proposition s allowance of optional rating factors promulgated by the california insurance commissioner the commissioner  the commissioner issued regulations permitting persistency as a rating factor under the new rate regulations 
no further definition of persistency discount was provided 
in  the commissioner conducted a market conduct examination of the company  after which he indicated he believed mercury s persistency discount  then awarded only to consumers serviced by the company s agents and brokers  was unfairly discriminatory 
in response to that examination  in the company filed  and secured approval  for a persistency discount awarded to insureds with continuous coverage with any insurer what has come to be called portable persistency 
this discount was consistently reapproved by the commissioner until commissioner harry low took the position that only loyalty persistency that is  the kind of persistency discount the company awarded prior to was allowable under proposition the california doi required all insurers offering persistency discounts to make class plan filings by january   removing the portability of the persistency discounts 
these class plans were never implemented because senate bill was enacted during amending the california insurance code to allow insurers to offer products with portable persistency discounts 
in january  this legislation was overturned through judicial proceedings in the los angeles superior court 
the company intervened in the original proceedings and expects appellate review of this ruling to be heard in the second quarter of the outcome of such action is uncertain  however  in the meantime  the company is allowed to maintain its existing portable persistency discounts 
the changes made during the class plan filing indicated that removing persistency discounts is revenue neutral for the company s existing business 
the removal of persistency discounts could have an impact on the company s price competitiveness in attracting new business and would cause many existing customers rates to change 
however  this impact  if any  is undeterminable 
on october   the commissioner proposed regulations which require greater disclosure of the commissions that brokers may receive from insurance companies for selling insurance policies 
the proposed regulations are designed to protect consumers from undisclosed commissions and would penalize any broker who places his or her own financial or other interest above that of a client 
under the proposed regulations  brokers and agents would be required to disclose all material facts regarding third party compensation 
brokers would also be required to provide their clients insurance quotes from the best available insurer 
the company believes that this proposed regulation  if enacted  will not have a material impact on its business since the company is a leading provider of competitively priced insurance in the california marketplace 
the california doi conducted a financial examination of the california companies as of december  the exam resulted in no material findings or recommendations

the company is subject to assessment by the association for its pro rata share of such claims based on premiums written in the particular line in the year preceding the assessment by insurers writing that line of insurance in california 
such assessments are based upon estimates of losses to be incurred in liquidating an insolvent insurer 
in a particular year  the company cannot be assessed an amount greater than of its premiums written in the preceding year 
assessments are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders the year after the assessment 
insurance subsidiaries in the other states are also subject to the provisions of similar insurance guaranty associations 
the company accounts for assessments in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  which requires the recognition of a liability when an assessment is levied or information is available indicating that an assessment is probable 
in addition  sop prohibits the recognition of an asset for recoveries related to new business or renewal of short duration policies 
there were no material assessments levied against the company during holding company act the california companies are subject to regulation by the california doi pursuant to the provisions of the california insurance holding company system regulatory act the holding company act 
the california doi may examine the affairs of each of the california companies at any time 
the holding company act requires disclosure of any material transactions among the companies

an insurance company is also required to notify the california doi of any dividend after declaration  but prior to payment 
the holding company act also provides that the acquisition or change of control of a california domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the california insurance commissioner 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities  which in the aggregate constitute or more of the voting securities of a california insurance company or of a person that controls a california insurance company  such as mercury general 
a person seeking to acquire control  directly or indirectly  of the company must generally file with the california insurance commissioner an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the company 
the holding company act also effectively restricts the company from consummating certain reorganizations or mergers without prior regulatory approval 
the insurance subsidiaries in florida  georgia  illinois  oklahoma and texas are subject to holding company acts in those states  the provisions of which are substantially similar to those of the holding company act 

table of contents assigned risks automobile liability insurers in california are required to sell bodily injury liability  property damage liability  medical expense and uninsured motorist coverage to a proportionate number based on the insurer s share of the california automobile casualty insurance market of those drivers applying for placement as assigned risks 
drivers seek placement as assigned risks because their driving records or other relevant characteristics  as defined by proposition  make them difficult to insure in the voluntary market 
premium rates for assigned risk business are set by the california doi 
in october  more stringent rules for gaining entry into the assigned risk program were approved  resulting in a substantial reduction in the number of assigned risks insured by the company since since january   the california insurance code has required that rates established for this program be adequate to support this program s losses and expenses 
the california doi approved a rate decrease of effective february  the california doi approved rate increases of and on new and renewal assigned risk business effective november  and november   respectively 
while the number of the company s assignments increased in and  its total assignments decreased slightly in in  assigned risks represented of total automobile direct premiums written and of total automobile direct premium earned 
the company attributes the low level of assignments to the competitive voluntary market 
many of the other states in which the company conducts business offer similar programs to that of california 
these programs are not a significant contributor to the business written in those states 
automobile insurance rating factor regulations california proposition requires that property and casualty insurance rates be approved by the california insurance commissioner prior to their use  and that no rate be approved which is excessive  inadequate  unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the provisions of the initiative 
the proposition specifies four statutory factors required to be applied in decreasing order of importance in determining rates for private passenger automobile insurance the insured s driving safety record  the number of miles the insured drives annually  the number of years of driving experience of the insured and whatever optional factors are determined by the california insurance commissioner to have a substantial relationship to risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
the statute further provides that insurers are required to give at least a discount to good drivers  as defined  from rates that would otherwise be charged to such drivers and that no insurer may refuse to insure a good driver 
the california insurance commissioner uses rating factor regulations which are designed to implement the proposition guidelines 
the company s rate plan was approved by the california insurance commissioner and operates under these rating factor regulations 
california financial responsibility law california requires proof of insurance for the registration new or renewal of a motor vehicle 
it also provides for substantial penalties for failure to supply proof of insurance if a driver is stopped for a traffic violation

terrorism risk insurance act of on november   the federal government enacted the terrorism risk insurance act of the act  which established a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured commercial property and casualty losses resulting from acts of terrorism  as defined within the act 
the terrorism insurance program the program requires all commercial property and casualty insurers licensed in the united states to participate

the company expects to continue the payment of quarterly dividends  however  the continued payment and amount of cash dividends will depend upon  among other factors  the company s operating results  overall financial condition  capital requirements and general business conditions 
as a holding company  mercury general is largely dependent upon dividends from its subsidiaries to pay dividends to its shareholders 
these subsidiaries are subject to state laws that restrict their ability to distribute dividends 
for example  california state laws permit a casualty insurance company to pay dividends and advances within any month period  without any prior regulatory approval  in an amount up to the greater of of statutory earned surplus at the preceding december  or statutory net income for the calendar year preceding the date the dividend is paid

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mercury general corporation and its subsidiaries collectively  the company is headquartered in los angeles  california and operates primarily as a personal automobile insurer selling policies through a network of independent agents and brokers in thirteen states 
the company also offers homeowners insurance  mechanical breakdown insurance  commercial and dwelling fire insurance  umbrella insurance  commercial automobile and commercial property insurance 
private passenger automobile lines of insurance accounted for approximately of the billion of the company s gross premiums written in  with approximately of the private passenger automobile premiums written in california 
this overview discusses some of the relevant factors that management considers in evaluating the company s performance  prospects and risks 
it is not all inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of the management discussion and analysis  the company s financial statements and notes thereto and all other items contained within this annual report on form k 
economic and industry wide factors regulatory the insurance industry is subject to strict state regulation and oversight and is governed by the laws of each state in which each insurance company operates 
state regulators generally have substantial power and authority over insurance companies including  in some states  approving rate changes and rating factors and establishing minimum capital and surplus requirements 
in many states  the insurance commissioner is an elected office and newly elected commissioners may emphasize different agendas or interpret existing regulations differently than previous commissioners 
in california  the company s largest market  the current commissioner took office in january it is uncertain how any regulatory changes implemented by the california insurance commissioner  or the insurance commissioner in any other state in which the company operates  will be resolved and how it will impact the company s operations 
cost uncertainty because insurance companies pay claims after premiums are collected  the ultimate cost of an insurance policy is not known until well after the policy revenues are earned 
consequently  significant assumptions are made when establishing insurance rates and loss reserves 
while insurance companies use sophisticated models and experienced actuaries to assist in setting rates and establishing loss reserves  there can be no assurance that current rates or current reserve estimates will be adequate 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will approve rate increases when the company s actuarial analysis shows that they are needed 
inflation the largest cost component for automobile insurers are losses which include medical costs and replacement automobile parts and labor repair costs 
there has recently been significant variation in the overall increases in medical cost inflation and it is often a year or more after the respective fiscal period ends before sufficient claims have closed for the inflation rate to be known with a reasonable degree of certainty 
therefore  it can be difficult to establish reserves and set premium rates  particularly when actual inflation rates are higher or lower than anticipated 
the company currently estimates low single digit inflation rates on bodily injury coverages for its major california personal automobile lines for the and accident years 
the inflation rate for these accident years is the most difficult to estimate because there remain many open claims 
should actual inflation be higher the company could be under reserved for its losses and profit margins would be lower 
loss frequency another component of overall loss costs is loss frequency  which is the number of claims per risks insured 
there has been a long term trend of declining loss frequency in the personal automobile insurance industry  which has benefited the industry as a whole 
however  it is unknown if loss frequency in the future will continue to decline  remain flat or increase 

table of contents underwriting cycle and competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  with periods of rising premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of substantial price competition and excess capacity soft market 
the company has historically seen premium growth in excess of during hard markets  whereas premium growth rates during soft markets have historically been in the single digits 
many of the company s major competitors announced better operating results in and throughout this typically signals a softening in the market  and consequently  the company experienced a decline in the rate of growth of its policies in force in california during however  this slowing in growth in california was offset by continued growth in recently entered states such as new jersey 
the company anticipates a further slowing of the growth rate in revenues  income and cash generation the company generates its revenues through the sale of insurance policies  primarily covering personal automobiles and homeowners 
these policies are sold through independent agents and brokers who receive a commission on average of of net premiums written for selling and servicing the policies 
the company believes that it has a more thorough underwriting process which gives the company an advantage over its competitors 
the company views its broker and agent relationships and underwriting process as one of its primary competitive advantages because it allows the company to charge lower prices yet realize better margins 
see item legal proceedings  and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company also generates revenue from its investment portfolio  which was approximately billion at the end of this investment portfolio generated nearly million in pre tax investment income during the portfolio is managed by company personnel with a view towards maximizing after tax yields and limiting interest rate and credit risk 
the company s results and growth have allowed it to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations  which was million in the company s cash flow from operations has exceeded million every year since and has been positive for over years 
cash flows from operations has been used to pay shareholder dividends and to help support growth 
opportunities  challenges and risks the company currently underwrites personal automobile insurance in thirteen states nine states entered into in previous years  california  florida  texas  oklahoma  georgia  illinois  new york  virginia and new jersey  and four states entered during  arizona  pennsylvania  michigan and nevada 
the company expects to continue its growth by expanding into new states in future years with the objective of achieving greater geographic diversification  so that non california premiums eventually account for as much as half of the company s total premiums 
there are  however  challenges and risks involved in entering each new state  including establishing adequate rates without any operating history in the state  working with a new regulatory regime  hiring and training competent personnel  building adequate systems and finding qualified agents to represent the company 
the company entered four new states during and believes that it has sufficient expertise to manage these challenges and risks to continue its expansion into additional new states 
the company does not expect to enter into any new states in the company is also subject to risks inherent in its business  which include but are not limited to the following a catastrophe  such as a major wildfire  earthquake or hurricane can cause a significant amount of loss to the company in a very short period of time 
a major regulatory change  could make it more difficult for the company to generate new business 

table of contents a sharp upward increase in market interest rates or an equity market crash could cause a significant loss to the company s investment portfolio 
to the extent that it is within the company s control  the company seeks to manage these risks in order to mitigate the effect that major events would have on the company s financial position 
the company is currently developing a next generation nextgen computer system to replace its existing legacy systems that currently reside on hewlett packard mainframe computers 
the nextgen system is being designed to be a multi state  multi line system that is expected to enable the company to enter new states more rapidly  as well as respond to legislative and regulatory changes more easily than the company s current system 
the nextgen system is in the final stages of development and is expected to be placed in operation during the nextgen system is expected to cost approximately million and to provide a significant positive benefit to the company 
as with any large scale technology implementation  risks associated with system implementation can occur that could significantly impact the operations of the company  although management has expended planning and development efforts to mitigate these risks 
general the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the effect of competition on pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  including the effect of natural disasters on losses  general economic conditions  the general regulatory environment in those states in which an insurer operates  state regulation of premium rates and other factors such as changes in tax laws 
the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
these cycles can have a large impact on the ability of the company to grow and retain business 
in management s view  and were periods of very good results for companies underwriting automobile insurance 
as a result  the automobile insurance market is presently extremely competitive with competitors reducing rates and increasing advertising expenditures 
the company expects this trend to continue in and consequently expects that the premium growth rate will likely decline from the levels seen in and 
the company operates primarily in the state of california  which was the only state in which it produced business prior to the company has since expanded its operations into the following states georgia  illinois  oklahoma  texas  florida  virginia  new york and new jersey 
in  the company began writing private passenger automobile insurance in arizona april  pennsylvania june  michigan october and nevada december 
during  approximately of the company s total net premiums written were derived from california as compared to in the decrease is the result of a greater portion of business written outside of california 
the company has established a diversification goal where by half of all business will be produced outside of california 
the process for implementing rate changes varies by state  with california  georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania and nevada requiring prior approval from the doi before a rate can be implemented 
illinois  texas  virginia  arizona and michigan only require that rates be filed with the doi  while oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
during  the company had no rate increases in california and implemented automobile rate increases in only two of the twelve non california states 
the company believes that its rates will remain competitive in the marketplace 
during  the company continued its marketing efforts for name recognition and lead generation 
the company believes that its marketing effort combined with price and reputation makes the company very competitive in california 
during  the company incurred approximately million in advertising expense 

table of contents the california insurance commissioner the commissioner uses rating factor regulations requiring automobile insurance rates to be determined by driving safety record  miles driven per year  years of driving experience and whatever optional factors are determined by the commissioner to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
the regulations further require that each of the four factors be applied in decreasing order of importance 
the company is participating in technical workshops conducted by the commissioner to develop evidence regarding two alternatives for changing the way the weighting and relevance of territories is determined in the rate making process 
the outcome of this matter is uncertain and the impact to the company cannot be determined at this time 
persistency discounts predate the proposition rate regulations 
they represent discounts on policy rates extended to consumers based on the number of consecutive years insurance coverage has existed 
in  in response to proposition s allowance of optional rating factors promulgated by the commissioner  the commissioner issued regulations permitting persistency as a rating factor under the new rate regulations 
no further definition of persistency discount was provided 
in  the commissioner conducted a market conduct examination of the company  after which he indicated he believed mercury s persistency discount  then awarded only to consumers serviced by the company s agents and brokers  was unfairly discriminatory 
in response to that examination  in the company filed  and secured approval  for a persistency discount awarded to insureds with continuous coverage with any insurer what has come to be called portable persistency 
this discount was consistently reapproved by the commissioner until commissioner harry low took the position that only loyalty persistency that is  the kind of persistency discount the company awarded prior to was allowable under proposition the california doi required all insurers offering persistency discounts to make class plan filings by january   removing the portability of the persistency discounts 
the company s class plans were never implemented because senate bill was enacted during amending the california insurance code to allow insurers to offer products with portable persistency discounts 
however  in january  this legislation was overturned through judicial proceedings in the los angeles superior court 
the company intervened in the original proceedings and expects appellate review of this ruling to be heard in the second quarter of the outcome of such action is uncertain  however  in the meantime  the company is allowed to maintain its existing portable persistency discounts 
the changes made during the class plan filing indicated that removing persistency discounts is revenue neutral for the company s existing business 
the removal of persistency discounts could have an impact on the company s price competitiveness in attracting new business and would cause many existing customer s rates to change 
however  the impact of eliminating persistency discounts  if any  is undeterminable 
on october   the commissioner proposed regulations which require greater disclosure of the commissions that brokers may receive from insurance companies for selling insurance policies 
the proposed regulations are designed to protect consumers from undisclosed commissions and would penalize any broker who places his or her own financial or other interest above that of a client 
under the proposed regulations  brokers and agents would be required to disclose all material facts regarding third party compensation 
brokers would also be required to provide their clients insurance quotes from the best available insurer 
the company believes that this proposed regulation  if enacted  will not have a material impact on its business since the company is a leading provider of competitively priced insurance in the california marketplace 
on june   the california state board of equalization sbe upheld notices of proposed assessments npas issued against the company for tax years through in these npas  the california franchise tax board ftb disallowed a portion of the company s expenses related to management services provided to its insurance company subsidiaries on grounds that such expenses were allocable to the company s tax deductible dividends from such subsidiaries 
the sbe decision also resulted in a smaller disallowance of the company s interest expense deductions than was proposed by the ftb in those years 
the company filed a petition for rehearing with the sbe and a rehearing was granted 
the rehearing is expected to be held in the spring of 
table of contents the company believes that the deduction of the expenses related to management services provided to its insurance company subsidiaries is meritorious and that this is further supported by the sbe s decision to grant a rehearing on the matter 
the potential net liability on the franchise tax issues in through  after federal tax benefit  amounts to approximately million 
the company has established a tax liability of approximately million for the issues related to these tax years 
on september   california governor arnold schwarzenegger signed into law assembly bill ab 
the law resolves an issue raised by the ftb where they interpreted a legal ruling ceridian to eliminate a dividends received deduction drd taken by insurance companies 
ab provides for an drd for tax years through and an drd for tax years after the company intends to refile its through tax returns based on the drd established by ab the tax liability for this item is included in the tax liabilities at december  the company is also involved in proceedings incidental to its insurance business 
see item legal proceedings  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires judgment and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
inflation is reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and reviews of historical reserving results 
the company performs its own loss reserve analysis and also engages the services of an independent actuary to assist in the estimation of loss reserves 
the company and the actuary do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates but rather calculate a point estimate 
management reviews the underlying factors and assumptions that serve as the basis for preparing the reserve estimate 
these include paid and incurred loss development factors  expected average costs per claim  inflation trends  expected loss ratios  industry data and other relevant information 
at december   the company recorded its point estimate of approximately million in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves which includes approximately million of incurred but not reported ibnr loss reserves 
ibnr includes estimates  based upon past experience  of ultimate developed costs which may differ from case estimates  unreported claims which occurred on or prior to december  and estimated future payments for reopened claims reserves 
management believes that the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date 
since the provisions are necessarily based upon estimates  the ultimate liability may be more or less than such provision 
the company s loss reserves estimated at december  produced a redundancy of million which was reflected in the financial statements as a reduction to the calendar year incurred losses 
the company attributes most of this redundancy to a change in the inflation rate assumptions used to establish reserves on the bodily injury coverage for california private passenger automobile insurance on the and accident years 
at year end  the company had assumed bodily injury severity inflation on california private passenger automobile insurance of on the accident year  on the accident year and on the accident year 
at year end  these assumptions were reduced to for  for and for the company reduced the inflation rate assumptions based on factors that emerged during including moderating to decreasing average amounts paid on closed claims in the and accident years and increased certainty in reserve amounts that comes through the passage of time as more claims from an accident period are closed 

table of contents the change in these inflation assumptions accounted for approximately million of the decrease in the expected ultimate loss on the reserves established at december  each percentage point change in the inflation rate assumption accounts for approximately million of the redundancy on the accident year losses and approximately million on the accident year losses 
the effect is greater on the latter accident year because the lowering of the rate for accident year has a compounding effect on accident year the remainder of the redundancy primarily occurred in the company s california homeowners line of business and florida personal automobile line of business 
california homeowners had approximately million in reserve redundancy and florida personal automobile had approximately million in reserve redundancy 
at december   the company assumed bodily injury inflation rates of approximately on the  and accident years for the california automobile lines of business 
the company estimates that each percentage point change in the inflation rate assumption would impact these accident years by approximately million individually with a compounding effect if adjusted for multiple accident years 
for example  if all years were changed by  would be affected by million  by million and by million for a total of approximately million 
the company complies with the sfas no 
definition of how insurance enterprises should recognize revenue on insurance policies written 
the company s insurance premiums are recognized as income ratably over the term of the policies  that is  in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
unearned premiums are carried as a liability on the balance sheet and are computed on a monthly pro rata basis 
the company evaluates its unearned premiums periodically for premium deficiencies by comparing the sum of expected claim costs  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs to related unearned premiums 
to the extent that any of the company s lines of business become substantially unprofitable  then a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
the company does not expect this to occur on any of its significant lines of business

in most cases  market valuations were drawn from trade data sources 
in no case were any valuations made by the company s management 
equity holdings  including non sinking fund preferred stocks  are  with minor exceptions  actively traded on national exchanges  and were valued at the last transaction price on the balance sheet date 
the company constantly evaluates its investments for other than temporary declines and writes them off as realized losses through the statement of income  as required by sfas no 
 when recovery of the net book value appears doubtful 
temporary unrealized investment gains and losses are credited or charged directly to shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of applicable taxes 
it is possible that future information will become available about the company s current investments that would require accounting for them as realized losses due to other than temporary declines in value 
the financial statement effect would be to move the unrealized loss from accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet to realized investment losses on the statement of income 
the company may have certain known and unknown potential liabilities that are evaluated using the criteria established by sfas no 
these include claims  assessments or lawsuits incidental to our business 
the company continually evaluates these potential liabilities and accrues for them or discloses them in the financial statement footnotes if they meet the requirements stated in sfas no 
while it is not possible to know with certainty the ultimate outcome of contingent liabilities  management does not expect them to have a material effect on the consolidated operations or financial position

at december   the company had on its books approximately million in goodwill related to the acquisition of concord and approximately million of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives related to the mcm acquisition

liquidity and capital resources mercury general is largely dependent upon dividends received from its insurance subsidiaries to pay debt service costs and to make distributions to its shareholders 
under current insurance law  the insurance companies are entitled to pay  without extraordinary approval  dividends of approximately million in the actual amount of dividends paid from the insurance companies to mercury general during was million 
as of december   mercury general also had approximately million in fixed maturity securities  equity securities and cash that can be utilized to satisfy its direct holding company obligations 
the principal sources of funds for the insurance companies are premiums  sales and maturity of invested assets and dividend and interest income from invested assets 
the principal uses of funds for the insurance companies are the payment of claims and related expenses  operating expenses  dividends to mercury general and the purchase of investments 
through the insurance companies  the company has generated positive cash flow from operations for over twenty consecutive years and in excess of million every year since during this same period  the company has not been required to liquidate any of its fixed maturity investments to settle claims or other liabilities 

table of contents because of the company s long track record of positive operating cash flows  it does not attempt to match the duration and timing of asset maturities with those of liabilities 
rather  the company manages its portfolio with a view towards maximizing total return with an emphasis on after tax income 
combined with cash and short term investments of million at december   the company believes its cash flows from operations are adequate to satisfy its liquidity requirements without the forced sale of investments 
however  the company operates in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs or that the company will not be required to raise additional funds to meet those needs  including future business expansion  through the sale of equity or debt securities or from credit facilities with lending institutions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
actual results may differ 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity investments  which at december  comprised of total investments at market value 
tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity investments with the remaining amount consisting of sinking fund preferred stocks and taxable bonds 
equity securities account for of total investments at market value 
the remaining of the investment portfolio consists of highly liquid short term investments which are primarily short term money market funds 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio goes up with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that utilizes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company historically invested in fixed maturity investments with a goal towards maximizing after tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date 
since assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s historical investment philosophy resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
however  due to the current interest rate environment  management has taken steps to reduce the duration of the company s bond portfolio 
bond investments made by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
consequently  the modified duration of the bond portfolio has declined to years at december  compared to years and years at december  and  respectively 
given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the bond portfolio at december  would decrease by approximately million 
at december   the company s strategy for common equity investments is an active strategy which focuses on current income with a secondary focus on capital appreciation 
the value of the common equity investments consists of million in common stocks and million in non sinking fund preferred stocks 
the common stock equity assets are typically valued for future economic prospects as perceived by the market 
the non sinking fund preferred stocks are typically valued using credit spreads to u 
s 
treasury benchmarks 
this causes them to be comparable to fixed income securities in terms of interest rate risk 

table of contents at december   the duration on the company s non sinking fund preferred stock portfolio was years 
this implies that an upward parallel shift in the yield curve by basis points would reduce the asset value at december  by approximately million  everything else remaining the same 
the common equity portfolio  representing approximately of total investments at market value  consists primarily of public utility common stocks 
these assets are theoretically defensive in nature and therefore have low volatility to changes in market price as measured by their beta 
beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for the company s common stock holdings was 
based on a hypothetical reduction in the overall value of the stock market  the fair value of the common stock portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
effective january   the company entered into an interest rate swap of its fixed rate obligation on its million fixed rate senior notes for a floating rate
