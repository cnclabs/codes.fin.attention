company and industry overview inamed is a global healthcare company that develops  manufactures and markets a diverse line of products that enhance the quality of peoples lives 
these products include breast implants for aesthetic augmentation and reconstructive surgery  a range of dermal products for use in facial rejuvenation  the lap band system designed to treat severe and morbid obesity  and the bioenterics bib system for the treatment of obesity 
we generate approximately of our revenues outside the us our primary markets are very competitive and subject to substantial government regulation 
pricing and market share pressures vary by product line and geographic market 
in general  inflationary trends result in increases in our labor and material costs 
in addition  there are foreign currency fluctuations and other risks associated with operating on a global basis  such as price and currency exchange controls  import restrictions  and changing economic  social and political conditions in foreign countries 
we expect these trends and risks to continue 
we will continue to manage these issues by capitalizing on our market presence  developing innovative products  investing in human resources  improving our manufacturing facilities  leveraging our cost structure  and possibly entering into alliances and other arrangements 
we derive the majority of our revenues from product sales 
we sell our breast aesthetics  facial aesthetics and obesity intervention products in the us to hospitals  clinics and doctors through a direct sales force 
internationally  our products are sold either through direct sales forces in countries where we have our own subsidiaries or through third party distributors 
we manufacture our products in california  costa rica and ireland 
we also purchase finished products and certain raw material components from third party manufacturers 
the cost of goods sold represents the cost of third party finished products  raw materials  labor and overhead 
gross margins may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in the selling prices of our products  the mix of products sold  changes in the cost of third party finished products  raw materials  labor and overhead and manufacturing efficiencies or inefficiencies 
in and  the cost of goods sold also includes accelerated depreciation charges related to the manufacturing consolidation see note to the consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million at december   an aggregate increase of million from million of cash and cash equivalents and no short term investments at december  at december   approximately million of our cash was held internationally which may be subject to us income tax if repatriated to the us the increase during was the result of cash provided by operations of million and cash from the issuance of common stock of million offset primarily by the purchase of investments of million  principal repayments of long term debt of million and the purchase of plant and equipment of million and intangibles of million 
cash provided by operating activities has been  and is expected to continue to be  our primary source of funds 
we invest a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in short term investments with maturities of less than one year 
cash provided by operations was million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a cash payment for our ethicon endo surgery  inc ethicon legal settlement of million in june pursuant to the terms of this settlement agreement  we commenced expensing the royalty in the third quarter of and the first payment was made in the fourth quarter of royalty amounts will vary based on the sales of these products and geography in which these products are sold 
trade accounts receivable increased million due to increased sales 
inventories increased million  primarily due to increased facial product inventory in the us we increased our inventory while we changed suppliers of human collagen mesh to support any transitional issues as well as to comply with our long term contract agreements 
in addition  we increased inventory to support the launch of new products 
other assets decreased million primarily due to a reduction in our trilucent insurance receivable see part i  item legal proceedings  breast implant litigation  trilucent breast implant matters 
accruals and other long term liabilities decreased million primarily due to payments with respect to our trilucent liability and a decrease in our deferred tax liability due to timing of payments 
cash provided by operations of million in increased by million from million in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in net income of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
in addition  we received an million tax benefit on stock option exercises compared to only million in we expect cash from operations to increase in as a result of increased sales and net income 
cash used in investing activities of million in consists of million for the purchase of short term investments to earn better rates of interest on our cash  million for the purchase of intangibles  primarily the purchase of license and distribution agreements  and million in capital expenditures  primarily for our plant expansions and our global enterprise resource planning  or erp  system 
cash used in investing activities of million in consisted primarily of capital expenditures for our global erp system and capacity expansion projects 
cash provided by financing activities in of million reflects proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding employee stock options and issuances pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan  offset by long term debt principal payments of million 
cash used in financing activities for the year of million reflected net principal payments of  partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding employee stock options and issuances pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had long term debt of million  million of which is classified in current liabilities 
in addition  we have a million revolving line of credit 
we have utilized million of the revolver capacity by having letters of credit issued to collateralize certain insurance programs 
the remaining million of revolver capacity was unused as of december  the borrowings under the current credit facilities bear interest at the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus 
remaining principal payments of and million are due in and  respectively 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are  in order of priority  preservation of principal  liquidity  and attaining a high rate of return 
consequently  our investments are generally of short duration and high credit quality 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing debt financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
further  we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to repay the existing term loan 
however  we may raise additional capital from time to time 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations license distribution agreements other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total the million in purchase obligations primarily relates to research and development commitments  including those related to clinical trials  for new and existing products 
the actual amounts  if any  and timing of such payments will depend upon a variety of factors outside of our control 
the million obligation for license and distribution agreements relates to various amounts contingently payable to third parties based on the successful completion of certain milestones related to regulatory approvals 
the actual amounts  if any  and timing of such payments will depend upon a variety of factors outside of our control 
the million obligations for other long term liabilities consists of long term and short term amounts as follows total other long term liabilities is million  and the short term portion of these long term liabilities is million see notes and of the financial statements for a detailed description

we expect sales to grow at a mid double digit rate in over inamed aesthetics breast 
the growth in and of breast aesthetic sales was driven by several key factors the acceptance of all aesthetics procedures has grown  including breast augmentation and reconstruction 
favorable demographics continue to emerge in the us and internationally for various types of aesthetic procedures  including breast augmentation 
our physician practice building initiatives and consumer awareness programs 
these include an advanced educational program for surgeons inamed academy and the company sponsored lookingyourbest web site for consumers and surgeons 
in the united states  we have seen a continued acceptance of the style smooth round saline matrix implants primarily used for augmentation purposes and the style and style smooth round silicone gel filled implants used in connection with the adjunct clinical study for breast reconstruction and revision 
continued growth and acceptance internationally for our biodimensional cohesive gel matrix products and line extensions such as the style soft touch line and the new style in  we expect sales of breast aesthetics products to grow in the mid double digits when compared to inamed health obesity intervention 
the increase in and sales was primarily due to the following continued growth and acceptance of the lap band system in the us  aided by our targeted physician practice building program as well as public relations efforts 
a strong increase in sales of the bib system internationally 
other factors affecting sales include an increase in insurance coverage for the lap band system and the awareness of the obesity epidemic that has been widely publicized in the press and is anticipated to be a health care issue for the foreseeable future 
in  sales of obesity intervention products are expected to increase in excess of over sales in we expect to achieve this growth by training and qualifying more physicians on the procedure  driving consumers to our established doctors through direct to consumer programs  working to achieve broader reimbursement for the product and the procedure  and educating consumers about the benefits of the bioenterics lap band system versus other medical procedures 
inamed aesthetics facial 
facial aesthetics sales experienced a decrease in over this decrease was primarily the result of the introduction of a competing facial aesthetics product in the hyaluronic acid class of products  called restylane  into the us market in january of our hyaluronic acid based dermal filler  hylaform  was approved by the fda in april in october  the fda approved another product in the hylaform line  hylaform plus  a large particle size hyaluronic acid based gel for mid to deep wrinkle correction 
in  sales of facial aesthetics products are expected to increase slightly over due to the full year effect of hylaform and hylaform plus in the united states and the launch of captique in early cost of goods sold cost of goods sold percent of sales gross profit margin percentage point change in gross profit margin over prior year the improvement of gross profit margins in and reflected a favorable product mix and the benefits of our manufacturing consolidation program  which was completed during the first quarter of the program savings generated were primarily the result of reduced payroll costs and lower cost manufacturing locations 
the annual savings from the manufacturing consolidation is estimated to be a reduction in us payroll and support costs of million  with a corresponding increase in costs in ireland of million and costa rica of million  with a net savings of million per year 
the savings is reflected in cost of goods sold on the income statement 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in our gross margin in also reflected the fact that we had and million of accelerated depreciation relating to our global manufacturing consolidation in and  respectively 
the assets related to the manufacturing consolidation were fully depreciated in the first quarter of  therefore we have had no further accelerated depreciation expense related to the manufacturing consolidation 
selling  general  and administrative sg a sg a percent of sales dollar change over prior year percent change over prior year selling and marketing expense increased in and on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales 
the increase in is primarily the result of royalty expenses related to the ethicon settlement and other recently approved products  and investments in key sales and marketing programs to support the expansion of our worldwide aesthetics franchise 
the increase in selling and marketing expense in over was largely due to the launch of cosmoderm and cosmoplast with focus on consumer awareness  and royalties associated with the sales of our aesthetic products 
general and administrative expense increased on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales in  and decreased on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales in the increase in is primarily due to a million charge related to our ethicon patent settlement and related litigation costs in the second quarter of additionally  we have experienced increased information technology costs in support of our new erp system 
excluding the non recurring ethicon charge  selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  in we present our selling  general and administrative numbers excluding the ethicon settlement because such settlement is a non recurring charge that is outside our normal business operations 
the numbers are presented in a manner that is consistent with how management views our business 
research and development r d r d percent of sales dollar change over prior year percent change over prior year the majority of our research and development expenses in the year were related to the clinical development programs for our juv derm and hylaform dermal fillers  our botulinum toxin type a product  reloxin  the silicone gel and cohesive silicone gel breast implant clinical trials  and pma applications as applicable in the us the increase in r d expense in over was primarily due to the commencement of phase iii of the reloxin trials and clinical investigations for juv derm  a non animal  hyaluronic acid based dermal filler 
the increase in investment in r d is essential to advance our strategic and market positions in our three main product lines around the world 
the majority of the expenses in related to the clinical development programs for our hylaform dermal filler  reloxin  and the silicone gel and cohesive silicone gel breast implant clinical trials  and pma applications as applicable in the us in  we expect research and development expenses will increase substantially over the expected increase is primarily due to the reloxin phase iii trials in the us  and the juv derm clinical trials and development in the us restructuring charges in we recorded million of restructuring costs 
this restructuring was undertaken to consolidate manufacturing facilities 
the manufacturing consolidation has resulted in improved efficiencies and cost savings 
the consolidation was completed in and involved transitioning santa barbara based manufacturing to our facilities in costa rica and ireland 
we eliminated approximately positions in santa barbara and added about of those to our facilities in costa rica and ireland 
the majority of the costs relate to severance which has been and will be paid from the beginning of through as part of the manufacturing consolidation  we accelerated the depreciation on certain assets with shortened useful lives 
for the years ending december  and we incurred and million of accelerated depreciation charges included in cost of goods sold on the income statement 
we do not expect any further charges related to the manufacturing consolidation 
amortization in  amortization of intangible assets was million compared to million in and million in the increase in was due to the purchase of new intangibles and the commencement of amortization on certain intangibles in the first and second quarters of the decrease in was primarily due to one patent becoming fully amortized in august we expect amortization expense on our existing intangibles to be approximately million per year 
restricted stock plan in we adopted the restricted stock plan  which authorizes us to issue shares of common stock to any employee  officer  consultant  or non employee director 
in the second quarter of  the stockholders approved an amendment which increased the number of authorized shares by  shares to  shares 
restricted stock awards may be granted by the board subject to vesting and any other restrictions including a period during which vested shares may not be sold as determined by the board and stated in an award agreement 
restricted stock may not be sold or otherwise transferred or pledged until the restrictions lapse or terminate 
authorized shares number of shares issued available for issuance the restricted stock plan the following chart summarizes the restricted stock based compensation charges that have been included in the following captions of the income statement  for each of the periods presented in thousands cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative interest income expense twelve months twelve months twelve months ended ended ended december  december  december  interest income interest expense interest income expense the increase in interest income in when compared to is related to increased investment balances and the rise in interest rates during the year 
during the same period  the decline in interest expense was related to decreased debt levels  the recognition of the million of interest expense related to the payoff of our interest rate swap in  and additional interest expense related to the recognition of deferred loan fees associated with accelerated principal payments in the decrease in over is due to lower interest rates and significantly lower debt levels  offset by additional charges for the recognition of unamortized loan fees and the realization of million in losses on our interest rate swap in in connection with the refinancing and prepayment of our debt 
foreign currency foreign currency gains and losses fluctuate based largely upon the fluctuation of the dollar to the eu euro and the japanese yen 
in  and  our net sales included approximately   and million  respectively  of favorable exchange effects 
our exchange effect continues to be positive due to the strengthening euro 
royalty income and other royalty income  net of other expenses  was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
income tax expense our effective tax rate was   and  for   and  respectively 
the lower tax rate in is mainly due to our ethicon patent settlement in the second quarter which is fully deductible in the us  a high tax rate jurisdiction 
excluding the non recurring ethicon charge  the effective tax rate would have been approximately in we present our effective tax rate excluding the ethicon settlement because such settlement is a non recurring charge that is outside our normal business operations which results in a one time benefit to our effective tax rate 
the lower tax rate in was due to increased economic activity in low tax jurisdictions and several non recurring items  including the recognition of additional foreign net operating loss carryforwards  the write off of the tax basis of certain foreign subsidiaries and the favorable resolution of several tax issues 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a provision allowing a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in we have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision  however  we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provide additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language 
the range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between million and million 
the related potential range of income tax expense is between million and million 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  litigation and warranties 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated from the sale of our products to doctors  hospitals  clinics and independent distributors 
we sell our products through a direct sales force in the us and through both a direct sales force and independent distributors internationally 
we recognize product revenue  net of sales discounts  returns and allowances  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and sfas no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists 
revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred and all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is considered probable 
appropriate reserves are established for anticipated returns and allowances based on historical experience 
we recognize revenue when title to the product and risk of loss transfer to customers provided there are no remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance 
we allow for the return of product from doctors  hospitals  and clinics within a specified time frame  and record estimated sales returns as a reduction of sales in the same period revenue is recognized 
we do not provide a right of return on facial products 
we calculate these sales provisions based upon historical experience with actual returns 
actual returns in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates 
if actual returns differ significantly from the estimates  an adjustment to revenue in the current or subsequent period would be recorded 
substantially all of the product returns relate to breast implants 
we believe our estimates for anticipated returns is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to estimate returns and  if actual returns vary  it could have a material impact on our reported sales and results of operations 
historically  our estimates of return rates have not fluctuated from the actual returns by more than to 
a portion of our revenue is generated from consigned inventory of breast implants maintained at doctors  hospitals and clinics locations 
the customer is contractually obligated to maintain a specific level of inventory and to notify us upon use 
for these products  revenue is recognized at the time we are notified by the customer that the product has been implanted 
notification is usually through the replenishing of the inventory and we periodically review consignment inventories to confirm accuracy of customer reporting 
fda regulations require tracking the sales of all implanted products 
our sales to independent distributors are conducted under the same revenue recognition criteria as sales via our direct sales force 
independent distributors do not have explicit or implicit rights to return product and do not maintain consignment inventory 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with certain product candidates prior to regulatory approval  based on our judgment of probable future commercialization 
as of december   inamed holds no inventory for product candidates not yet approved by regulatory agencies 
we write off inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory or write it down to the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we believe our estimates of inventory values is a critical accounting estimate because if actual future demand or market conditions differ from those projected by us  additional inventory valuation adjustments may be required 
in addition  we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other factors  a decision denying approval of the product candidate by the necessary regulatory bodies  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are based on the analysis of historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
we believe our estimates for our allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we account for long lived assets  other than goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  which superseded sfas no 
and certain sections of apb opinion no 
specific to discontinued operations 
sfas no 
classifies long lived assets as either to be held and used  to be disposed of by other than sale  or to be disposed of by sale 
this standard introduces a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that an entity review its long lived assets and certain related intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include substantial operating losses  significant negative industry trends and significant changes in how we use an asset 
upon the determination that an impairment review is required we would compare the carrying amounts of the long lived asset to its fair value  which is determined using a discounted cash flow model 
this model requires estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital and other relevant factors 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends  current budgets  operating plans  and other industry data 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment charge is the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
as with all cash flow models there is an inherent subjectivity 
the assumptions listed above could be different from actual results which would in turn create a different valuation 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for those assets 
we also adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  as a result  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subject to a transitional impairment analysis and is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of october  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
the test for impairment involves the use of estimates related to the fair values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate the fair value of the reporting unit in relation to its carrying value  including goodwill 
as long as the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and no specific circumstances indicate a loss in value for goodwill  no impairment charge will be recognized 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  we will measure the amount of the impairment loss and record an impairment charge based on a discounted cash flow model 
other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which are periods of up to years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we reassess the estimated useful lives annually 
we believe the estimate of our valuation of long lived assets and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because if circumstances arose that led to a decrease in the valuation it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
income taxes deferred income tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the statutory marginal income tax rate in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the deferred income tax assets or liabilities from period to period 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider our ability to carryback losses  forecasted earnings and future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for and amount of a valuation allowance 
we believe the estimate of our income tax assets  liabilities and expense are critical accounting estimates because if the actual income tax assets  liabilities and expenses differ from our estimates the outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations 
litigation we are involved in various litigation matters as a claimant and as a defendant 
we record any amounts recovered in these matters when collection is certain 
we record liabilities for claims against us when the losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
amounts recorded are based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel  and management 
we believe that our estimate for litigation liabilities is a critical accounting estimate because actual amounts may differ from estimates and may materially impact our results of operations 
product warranties we have accruals for our warranty programs for our breast implant sales in the united states  europe  and certain other countries 
we estimate the amount of potential future claims from this warranty based on actuarial analysis 
expected future obligations are determined based on the history of product shipments and claims and are discounted to a current value 
the liability is included in both the current and long term liabilities in the balance sheet 
substantially all of the product warranty liability arises from the us warranty program 
the us plan  in most cases  provides lifetime product replacement and one thousand two hundred dollars of financial assistance for surgical procedures within ten years of implantation 
the warranty programs in non us markets have similar terms and conditions to the us plan 
we do not currently offer a warranty on our facial or health products  and therefore no amount is included in the liability for those products 
we do not warrant any level of aesthetic result and  as required by government regulation  make extensive disclosures concerning the risks of our products and implantation surgery 
we believe that our estimate for product warranties is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to estimate failure rates  claim amounts  and discount rates 
changes to actual claims and interest rates could have a material impact on the actuarial calculation which could materially impact our reported expenses and results of operations 
recent pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairments and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides a three step impairment model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires companies to recognize such impairments as an impairment loss equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value at the reporting date 
the disclosure requirements are applicable for the current year end 
the adoption of eitf in the third quarter of did not have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is applicable to fiscal years beginning after june  we do not anticipate the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
sfas  accounting and disclosure guidance for foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  sfas 
the american jobs creation act of introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer  provided certain criteria are met 
sfas allows an entity time beyond the current reporting period to evaluate the effect of the act on its plans to reinvest or repatriate foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas accounting for income taxes  and provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
this staff position was effective upon issuance 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussions 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption  the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments and the amortization method for compensation cost 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
we have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of sfas r 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we anticipate adopting the prospective method and are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus regarding issue no 
 accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination eitf 
eitf requires an acquirer in a business combination to evaluate any preexisting relationship with the acquiree to determine if the business combination in effect contains a settlement of the preexisting relationship 
a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship should be viewed as a multiple element transaction 
eitf is effective for business combinations after october   but requires goodwill resulting from prior business combinations involving parties with a preexisting relationship to be tested for impairment by applying the guidance in the consensus 
we do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  inamed s operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies 
these fluctuations can vary our cost of financing and operations 
interest rate exposure based on inamed s overall interest rate exposure at december   which was variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates applied to the outstanding debt as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
foreign currency exposure inamed s foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the movement of the us dollar relative to the euro and yen 
inamed s transactional currency exposures arise when inamed or one of its subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
inamed also faces currency exposure arising from the translation of the financial results of inamed global operations into us dollars at exchange rates that have fluctuated during the reporting period 
there were no foreign exchange forward or option contracts at december  or based on inamed s overall exposure for foreign currency at december   a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on its balance sheet  net income  or cash flows over a one year period
