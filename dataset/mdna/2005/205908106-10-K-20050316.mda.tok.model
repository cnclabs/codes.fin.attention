the company s clients are primarily global companies  serviced by the company s offices in the united states  canada and india 
the company had revenues for the full year of million  compared to million in the comparable period of the revenue increase of for the full year was primarily attributable to growth in our solutions federal business due to the april acquisition by rgii of aim 
also contributing to the revenue increase was growth achieved by the company s chimes subsidiary 
revenue growth during the year of was partially offset by revenue declines in our commercial non federal solutions business and declines in our it services staff augmentation due to a decrease in demand for temporary technology workers and the trend of companies to outsource technology jobs offshore

management continues to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet  with approximately million in cash and cash equivalents at december   along with million in working capital and no debt outstanding 
on april   the company s subsidiary rgii acquired aim  a federal government it services company  for approximately million in cash 
the acquisition of aim is directly linked to the company s strategy of expanding its presence in the federal government it market and pursuing bolt on expansions to rgii 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed a restructuring initiative whereby the company s business model has been realigned  effective january   around its three distinct segments of clients federal government  commercial and vendor management services chimes  and will report accordingly to conform to the new presentation of chc business segments for the first quarter of as a result of the realigned business model  the company has reduced its annual costs by approximately million  which will be predominately reflected in chc s commercial division reported in solutions segment in 
although this realigned business model is designed to deliver improved operational performance for the company  the level of business activity in the it market remains uncertain 
this uncertainty reduced revenues in the company s it services and commercial non federal solutions businesses in as compared to the prior year 
the it services business accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue in  compared to in although it services revenue has shown signs of stabilization during  the company cannot predict if this growth is sustainable and when the overall level of business activity in the it market will improve 
revenue generating activities the company s consolidated revenues are primarily derived from professional services rendered in the information technology sector 
the company operates its business in three basic segments  it services  the solutions group and chimes  inc the distinctions between the it services and solutions group segments primarily relate to the management and supervision of services performed and related gross margins 
chimes  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of chc  provides workforce procurement and management services to global companies 
the it services business consists of providing technology consultants to large organizations on a temporary hire basis ie staff augmentation 
the consultant work is supervised and managed by the client 
for the most recent year  this segment represented approximately of total revenues 
the it services business tends to be a lower risk  lower gross margin business with very competitive pricing 
the solutions group  tends to be a higher margin  higher risk business  due to the fact that the company is responsible for project deliverables and other conditions contained in statements of work and or contracts with clients 
virtually all projects performed by the solutions group are it related and consist of practices such as application development  outsourcing arrangements  government services  health insurance portability and accountability act  hipaa  services  technology training and managed services 
for the year  the solutions group excluding chimes accounted for approximately of consolidated revenues 
the company s client relationships are memorialized in a master agreement  which addresses the terms and conditions which define the engagement 
depending on the service to be performed for the client  either a task order in the case of a staffing engagement or a statement of work sow in the case of a solutions engagement is generated 
the sow is signed by both the company and the client 
in general  no solutions work is done unless there is a sow because the sow provides the technical details of the work to be done 
the sow  although falling under the corresponding master agreement  is a stand alone binding contractual document  typically outlining the project objectives  describing the personnel who will work on the project  describing phases of the project  the timeframes for work performance  and the rate of compensation  on a time and material basis 
in the event that the parameters of the project expand or otherwise change  a project change request is implemented  to memorialize whatever change has occurred to the deliverables  personnel and or time and material 
the master agreements  in conjunction with the sow s  are written to define  with as much detail as possible  the client relationship and all aspects of the work to be performed for the client 
with regard to revenues expected in future periods  each sow has a defined term or sets forth the anticipated length of a project 
where a client engagement is on going  like certain help desk type services  the master agreement would still have a term length  but would recite that the agreement was renewable 
generally  solutions engagements are for a year or less 
staffing engagements can and do last for more than a year  with variations in the number of consultants being provided at any given time 
staffing engagements are generally cancelable by clients with a two to four week notice period 
chimes  inc is a human capital management solution company that  through the use of proprietary software and processes  manages the temporary workforce of large organizations 
during  chimes accounted for approximately of total revenues 
critical accounting policies the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements are related to revenue recognition  the evaluation of the bad debt reserve  the valuation of goodwill and the valuation of the deferred tax asset 
revenue recognition approximately of consolidated revenue in both and was derived from time and material contracts 
for the it services division  revenues are recognized as services are performed under time and material contracts 
under a typical time and material billing arrangement  our clients are billed on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  revenue is estimated and accrued for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are billed the following month 
the solutions group recognizes revenue either on a time and material basis or on a fixed fee basis  however  principally on a time and material basis 
for fixed fee contracts  revenue is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion 
each fixed fee contract has different terms  milestones and deliverables 
the milestones and deliverables primarily relate to the work to be performed and the timing of the billing 
at the end of each reporting period an assessment of revenue recognized on the percentage of completion and milestones achieved criteria is made 
if it becomes apparent that estimated cost will be exceeded or required milestones or deliverables will not have been obtained  an adjustment to revenue and or costs will be made 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimated revenues and costs are recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the impact of any revisions become known 
unbilled accounts receivable  in the it services and solutions group  represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services performed in advance of client billings principally on a time and material basis 
at the end of each accounting period  revenue is accrued for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are billed the following month 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on fixed fee contracts arise when percentage of completion accounting is used 
such amounts are billed at specific dates or at contract completion 
the company s chimes subsidiary recognizes revenue primarily on a transaction fee basis 
the chimes service offering aggregates the suppliers of temporary workers to the client and renders one invoice to the client 
upon payment from the client  chimes deducts a transaction fee and remits the balance of the client payment to the applicable vendor 
chimes recognizes only their fee for the service  not the aggregate billing to the client 
the gross amount of the client invoicing is not considered revenue or a receivable to chimes because there is no earnings process for the gross amount and by contract terms  chimes is not obligated to pay the vendor until paid by the client 
evaluation of bad debt reserve the company determines its bad debt reserve by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the client s current ability to pay its obligation to the company and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill as of december  and  the fair value of each of the reporting units was calculated using the following approaches i market approach and ii income approach 
the reporting units are equal to  or one level below  reportable segments 
under the market approach  value is estimated by comparing the performance fundamentals relating to similar public companies stock prices 
multiples are then developed of the value of the publicly traded stock to various measures and are then applied to each reporting unit to estimate the value of its equity 
under the income approach  value was determined using the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
the fair value conclusion of the reporting units reflects an appropriately weighted value of the market multiple approach and the income approach discussed above 
an asset approach was not used because the asset approach is most relevant for liquidation approaches  investment company valuations and asset rich company valuations ie real estate entities and was not deemed relevant for manufacturing and service company going concern valuations 
for the year ended december   using an evaluation prepared by an independent appraisal firm  the company reassessed the carrying value of goodwill associated with its solutions group 
because of a reduction in projected future cash flows in the commercial solutions business unit  primarily resulting from significant revenue declines in  the company determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a non cash charge of million  related to the write off of the commercial solutions goodwill 
there was no income tax effect on the impairment charge as the related goodwill was primarily attributable to acquisitions which yielded no tax basis for the company 
the remaining solutions goodwill of million  as of december   is associated with the company s federal government practice 
as of december   the indicated fair value of the federal government reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
as a result  the company concluded that the goodwill of approximately million is not impaired 
for the year ended december   the company completed valuations of the carrying value of the remaining goodwill and as of december   it was determined that no impairment had occurred at that date 
valuation of the deferred tax asset the company records deferred tax assets for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and their respective tax bases  and operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers the scheduled reversal periods of the deferred tax assets as well as projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
the company has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards  and deductible temporary differences that may reduce taxable income in future periods 
the company has provided full valuation allowances on the future tax benefits related to capital losses  foreign net operating losses  and most state net operating losses 
the company believes that the valuation allowance is appropriate because these deferred tax assets have relatively short carryforward periods or relate to taxing jurisdictions which do not allow the filing of consolidated tax returns 
the company expects to continue to maintain a valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained in the applicable taxing jurisdictions  or strategies are developed that would enable the company to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of these deferred tax assets will be realized 
the company believes that it is more likely than not that the net remaining deferred tax assets of million at december  will be realized  principally based upon forecasted taxable income 
although the company has experienced operating losses in the past  the company anticipates improved operational performance in resulting from the company s realignment initiatives completed in the fourth quarter of  and continued improvement in the operating results of its chimes subsidiary 
the realignment initiatives are expected to reduce annual expenses by approximately million  while chimes operating performance is expected to improve significantly in it should be noted that chimes reduced its operating loss in to approximately  from a loss of approximately million in this operating improvement is expected to continue in the minimum average annual taxable income required to realize the deferred tax assets over the year net operating loss carryforwrd period is approximately million

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies 
the accounting provisions and disclosure requirements of fin are effective immediately for vies created after january   and are effective for the company s fiscal period ending march   for vies created prior to february  in december  the fasb published a revision to fin fin r to clarify some of the provisions of the interpretation and to defer the effective date of implementation for certain entities 
under the guidance of fin r  public companies that have interests in vie s that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities are required to apply the provisions of fin r for periods ending after december  a public company that does not have any interests in special purpose entities but does have a variable interest in a vie created before february   must apply the provisions of fin r by the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  adoption of fin r did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in march  the fasb emerging issues task force eitf released issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance for determining whether impairment for certain debt and equity investments is other than temporary and the measurement of an impaired loss 
the recognition and measurement requirements of eitf were initially effective for reporting periods beginning after june  in september  the fasb staff issued fasb staff position fsp eitf that delayed the effective date for certain measurement and recognition guidance contained in eitf the fsp requires that entities continue to apply previously existing other than temporary guidance until a final consensus is reached

revised  share based payment fas r 
the provisions of this statement are effective for the company s third quarter ending september  fas r requires compensation cost be recognized for new awards of equity instruments and unvested awards on the adoption date 
we expect the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the company s financial statements  but we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of the adoption because certain assumptions used in the calculation of the value of share based payments may change in risk factors the company s it services and solutions commercial revenues have declined and the operating loss has increased because demand for it services has weakened and may continue to weaken  in the industries and markets that chc serves 
the company s revenues are affected by the level of business activity of its clients  and the related demand for it services to support these client activities 
as a result of weakened demand for the company s it services  revenues and results of operations have been negatively impacted 
for the year ended december  and  it services revenue decreased to million from million  respectively  a decrease of million  or 
solutions commercial decreased approximately million in for the years ended december  and  it services operating loss increased to million from million  respectively  an increase of million  or 
chc cannot predict when client demand will improve  and to what extent demand for the company s it services and solutions commercial will improve 
the current trend of companies moving technology jobs and projects offshore has caused and could continue to cause revenues to decline 
in the past few years  more companies are using or are considering using low cost offshore outsourcing centers  particularly in india  to perform technology related work and projects 
this trend has contributed to the decline in domestic it staff augmentation revenue as well as on site solutions oriented projects 
the company now has its own outsourcing centers in india and canada to compete for this business  but this new business has not been sufficient to offset the revenue decline 
additionally  the equivalent amount of work in low cost centers will generate substantially less revenue due to the lower billing rates that are charged in these offshore outsourcing centers

consequently  rgii is reimbursed based upon direct expenses attributable to the contract plus a percentage based upon indirect expenses 
the indirect rates are estimated 
accordingly  if the actual rates as determined by the defense contract audit agency dcaa are below the estimated rates  a refund for the difference will be due to the us government 
a significant refund due to the us government may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
dcaa has completed its incurred cost audits for all fiscal years through december  past audits have not resulted in significant adjustments

many of the company s current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources and generate greater revenues than the company 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in clients requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their services and products 
in addition  current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their services or products to address the staffing and solution needs of prospective clients

as part of its strategy  the company pursues strategic acquisitions 
on july   chc purchased all of the capital stock of rgii technologies  inc  a federal it services company 
on april   rgii purchased aim to further its commitment to driving the growth potential that exists in the federal government market and to expand rgii s footprint  providing an entrance into certain government agencies  as well as strong relationships with large  prime contractors

the steps taken to protect proprietary rights may not prevent misappropriation of chc s proprietary rights  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if third parties were to use or otherwise misappropriate chc s copyrighted materials  trademarks or other proprietary rights without consent or approval  chc s competitive position could be harmed  or it could become involved in litigation to enforce its rights

if chc is forced to defend against any such claims  whether they are with or without merit or are determined in its favor  the company may face costly litigation  loss of access to  and use of software and diversion of technical and management personnel 
as a result of such dispute  chc may have to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may be unavailable on terms acceptable to chc  or at all

the company has adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of the company or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for its stock 
certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger or tender offer involving chc more difficult  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of the shareholders 
these provisions include adoption of a preferred shares rights agreement  commonly known as a poison pill and giving the board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without shareholder approval 
the rights of the holders of chc s common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of chc s outstanding voting stock 
the above factors and certain provisions of the new york business corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of the company  including transactions in which the shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of chc common stock
