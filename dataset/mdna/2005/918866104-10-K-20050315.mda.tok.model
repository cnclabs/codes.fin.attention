general valassis results for reflect revenue growth in all of our business segments 
while fsi revenues were up only slightly  our cluster targeted  to and international services segments all experienced double digit revenue growth in our rop segment also contributed to the overall growth with a revenue increase in excess of  however  the majority of this revenue increase is attributed to the changing fee structure for certain rop contracts 
the cooperative fsi industry experienced mid single digit unit page growth in while industry page growth was positive and our fsi market share increased  overall fsi pricing declined in  in comparison to this decline in fsi pricing had a negative impact on profits in the fsi segment 
during the third quarter of  we announced a strategy to increase valassis pricing without a loss in market share 
the results of this initiative are yet to be conclusive  although we are cautiously optimistic that valassis fsi pricing will begin to improve 
due to the multi year nature of fsi customer contracts  the economic impact of the competitive pricing environment will continue into future periods even if pricing improves for new contracts 
fsi revenues are expected to be down by a percentage in the low single digits due to lower pricing on contracts negotiated in and that will affect cooperative fsi business placed in during  we continued our strategy to grow our customer base 
for the year ended december  approximately of our revenue came from consumer packaged goods manufacturers  came from telecommunications  came from specialty retailers  came from food service  came from direct response marketers  came from grocery retailers including drug  wholesale and mass merchants  came from consumer services ie financial  internet  came from other types of customers ie automotive  hardware software  newspapers 
the february acquisition of nch  with operations in the united states  mexico and europe  has expanded our product portfolio to include promotion information management products and coupon clearing services 
we continue to focus on nch s core expertise of managing the financial transactions between retailers and consumer packaged goods manufacturers related to their promotional activities 
while we believe there continues to be growth opportunities in the u 
s  we are expanding our geographic reach by testing new media products in europe 
we began testing new products in germany  spain and italy in and will continue testing new media products and services in we expect many of the macro economic trends we saw in to continue into it is anticipated that customers will continue to link marketing spending to revenue generation  leading marketers to choose promotional alternatives that provide measurable return on investment 
customer marketing budgets are projected to be up moderately and continued economic recovery should lead to additional new product introductions 
marketing dollars should also shift to home delivered promotional media due to increases in television fragmentation  the rise of television commercial blocking products  growth in commercial free radio programming and greater participation in the national do not call list 
these trends should continue to have a positive impact on our business  increasing the marketing dollars our customers will allocate to the home delivered promotional products we offer

revenue growth includes million from the inclusion of a full year of results for nch versus months in and million due to the purchase of direct marketing services in september of revenues were up million  or  over revenue

operating costs cost of products sold was million in compared to million in and million in  increasing as a percentage of revenue each year 
gross margin in was versus in and in the decrease in gross margin percentage from compared to and from compared to was primarily the result of competitive pricing issues in the fsi segment 
fsi unit costs were flat as the result of mid single digit increases in paper costs offset by decreases in media insertion due to an increase in average pages per book and a reduction in printing cost 
additionally  the gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by a change in mix resulting in a larger percentage of sales from lower margin products 
selling  general and administrative costs increased in to million versus million in the increase resulting from a full year of costs from nch  which was consolidated beginning february  was million 
nearly half of the remaining increase was due to increases in performance based incentive plans  with the balance due primarily to the acquisition of dms and investments being made in future growth opportunities

segment results fsi in  fsi revenue increased to million compared to the increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in units pages due to industry growth and a gain in market share of approximately  offset by a high single digit reduction of average price caused by the current intense competitive environment 
the cooperative fsi industry continues to show unit growth with industry pages increasing by a percentage in the mid single digits in fsi unit costs were flat as a result of mid single digit percentage increases in paper costs  offset by the efficiencies in media insertion costs caused by higher average pages per book  and reduced production costs 
fsi revenues in were also impacted by downward pricing pressure as well as a loss in market share  resulting in a revenue decrease of compared to paper represents approximately of the cost of products sold for our fsi business 
valassis purchases a combination of coated and uncoated paper 
to protect valassis against the risk of price fluctuations  a significant portion of our paper requirements is purchased from two paper companies under long term contracts 
these contracts limit the amount of increases or decreases to approximately in any calendar year of valassis cost of paper purchased from these suppliers 
such cost can be adjusted quarterly 
as of january   approximately of our fsi paper requirements were under long term contract 
the remainder of our paper requirement is bought pursuant to contracts that are typically three to six months in duration or on spot basis 
valassis maintains on average less than days of paper inventory 
rop revenue for rop increased in to million 
changes in terms of certain contracts away from transaction fee based business net revenue to gross revenue business accounted for million of this increase 
the remaining increase was due to incremental business  most notably in the telecommunications customer segment 
the gross margin in this segment has declined  due to a shift in business to larger volume customers at lower margins  however operating profits grew in excess of for run of press revenue was up in to million versus this increase was due to increased demand from both existing and new customers and an increased sales focus 
cluster targeted our cluster targeted revenue increased in to million versus the major drivers of this growth were increased demand for solo inserts and polybag advertising programs and a continued rebound in customer product sampling 
a renewed focus on enhancing margins resulted in an improvement in gross margin of over basis points 
in cluster targeted revenue was million  a increase over this increase was attributed to a strong rebound in product sampling and polybag advertising 
in addition  solo preprints continued to grow  in part due to new customers in the retail category 
to the to segment had revenue of million in  an increase of million or over approximately million of this growth relates to the purchase of dms  the direct mail division of catalina marketing

this segment had revenue of million in versus million in  as the result of the purchase of nch with revenue of approximately million 
financial condition  liquidity and sources of capital valassis liquidity requirements arise mainly from its working capital needs  primarily accounts receivable  inventory and debt service requirements 
cooperative fsi customers except remnant space customers are billed for of each order eight weeks in advance of the publication date and are billed for the balance immediately prior to the publication date 
fsi revenue accounted for of valassis total revenue in valassis inventories work in progress at cost while it accrues progress billings as a current liability at full sales value 
although valassis receives considerable payments from its customers prior to the publication of promotions  revenue is recognized only upon publication dates 
therefore  the progress billings on the balance sheet include any profits in the related receivables 
the majority of the revenue generated by nch is from its coupon clearing business 
nch invoices the face value of the coupon  a retailer handling fee if applicable as well as nch s processing fee 
the face value and the retailer handling fee are ultimately remitted by nch to retailers and their agents 
nch records a gross receivable and payable for the coupon face value as well as the retailer handling fees and recognizes revenue only on the nch processing fee 
sources and uses of cash cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  versus million at december  this decrease was the result of cash provided by operating activities of million and cash used by investing activities and financing activities of million and million  respectively  during the year ended december  cash flow from operating activities was million in this is the result of net earnings of million adjusted for non cash items  the largest of which are depreciation and amortization of million 
changes in working capital accounted for a million decrease in cash  primarily as a result of increased accounts receivable as of december  accounts receivable increased due to increased sales activity to record levels in the fourth quarter of in addition  collections within our rop segment have been slower than anticipated causing an increase in days sales outstanding 
net cash used in investing activities was million  down from million in cash used in investing activities decreased in due to the decreased level of spending on acquisitions during the year from million to million 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ending december   primarily driven by million used for the continued share repurchase program and the payment of million in connection with the exercise of the june  put option by the bondholders of the zero coupon senior convertible notes due  as fully described below 
current and long term debt as of december   valassis debt was million  which consists of million million  net of discount of its senior notes due  million of zero coupon senior convertible notes due  and million of senior convertible notes due in addition  we have a revolving line of credit of million with a variable rate of interest calculated on either a euro currency based rate or a prime rate 
during the year ended december   there was no outstanding balance under this line of credit 
valassis was in compliance with all debt covenants at december  all of our long term debt contains cross default provisions which become applicable if we default under any mortgage  indebtedness or instrument for money borrowed by valassis and the default results in the acceleration of such indebtedness in excess of million 
additionally  each of the senior convertible notes contains conversion triggers based upon credit rating downgrades by either moody s investor service  inc or standard poor s rating group 
in may  valassis issued million of senior convertible notes due in  with a yield to maturity of per year 
we utilized approximately million of the proceeds to repurchase million in face value of our zero coupon convertible senior notes due in the resulting premium and write off of fees and discounts resulted in a million refinancing charge 
the holders of valassis zero coupon senior convertible notes due in the notes had the option to require valassis to purchase all or a portion of their notes on june  at a price of per  of principal amount at maturity  payable in cash or common stock at valassis option 
of the  bonds outstanding at that date   were put back to valassis 
valassis chose to settle the put with cash and  as such  paid million on june  to the trustee of the notes 
the remaining debt balance related to the notes is approximately million  which represents the accreted value of the notes as of december  the remaining holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on june   june  and june   at a price of  and per note  respectively  payable in cash 
valassis had the right to pay for the june  put in either cash or common stock 
in connection with an amendment to sfas no

also  each holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes if a change of control of valassis occurs on or before june  valassis  at its option  may redeem all or a portion of the notes at their accreted value at any time on or after june   for cash 
the holders of the senior convertible notes due in the notes receive cash interest payments of per year on the original discounted amount  payable semiannually from through the holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on may   may   may   may  and may  at a price of    and per note  respectively  payable in cash or common stock at the option of valassis

valassis  at its option  may redeem all or a portion of the notes at their accreted value at any time on or after may   for cash 
future commitments and contractual obligations valassis intends to use cash generated by operations to meet interest and principal repayment obligations  for general corporate purposes  to reduce its indebtedness  to make acquisitions and to repurchase common stock through our stock repurchase program 
as of december   valassis had authorization to repurchase an additional million shares of its common stock under its existing share repurchase program 
management believes we will generate sufficient funds from operations and will have sufficient lines of credit available to meet currently anticipated liquidity needs  including interest and required payments of indebtedness 
valassis contractual obligations as of december   are as follows payments due by period in thousands of us dollars total less than year years years more than years public debt revolving credit facility operating leases other long term liabilities interest non current long term debt is included at face value

capital expenditures capital expenditures were million net of million in assets purchased from a settlement of property insurance claim related to a fire at our corby  england facility for the year ended december   largely representing technology enhancements and the purchase of a new printing press 
management expects future capital expenditure requirements of approximately million to million over each of the next three to five years to meet the business needs of enhancing technology and replacing equipment as required 
it is expected these expenditures will be made using funds provided by operations 
recent accounting pronouncements on september   the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached a consensus with respect to issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
the eitf s consensus states that shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to contingent convertible securities should be included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether their market price triggers or other contingent features have been met 
additionally  in its efforts to converge with international accounting standards  the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued an exposure draft  earnings per share an amendment of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
this exposure draft requires contracts that contain an option to settle in cash or stock be assumed to settle in stock for diluted earnings per share computations 
valassis has irrevocably waived its rights to settle the principal amount of its notes and the june  put option related to the notes in stock 
therefore  valassis diluted eps is not affected by this pronouncement at the current stock price 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the standard  which is effective for the first interim or annual period after june   requires that all equity based compensation be recorded in the financial statements at the grant date fair value 
currently  we disclose the pro forma net income and related pro forma income per share information in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we are evaluating the method of adoption and the impact of this statement which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after june  as such  valassis is required to adopt these provisions at the beginning of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements and do not believe that its adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
for additional information see note  significant accounting policies  of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  valassis does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets historically have been reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
revenue recognition fsi revenue for fsis and custom cooperative fsis is recognized in the period that the product is distributed in the newspaper 
in accordance with industry practice  valassis generally pre bills fsi customers except remnant space in advance of the related distribution date 
however  these billings are reflected as progress billings liability until the appropriate distribution period 
provision for rebates or pricing adjustments are made at the time that the related revenue is recognized 
rop rop revenue is recognized on the date that the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
some customers have contracts whereby valassis earns a transaction fee and the media costs are pass through costs to the customer 
in such cases  valassis only recognizes the transaction fee as revenue on the date the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
customer contracts can vary which may lead to material changes in revenue for this segment  while not affecting absolute gross margin dollars 
cluster targeted the majority of cluster targeted products are newspaper delivered and revenue is recognized in the period that the product is distributed 
for non newspaper delivered products  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or distributed to the consumer via direct to door 
to revenue for direct mail products is recognized when the product is inserted into the united states postal service mail stream 
in most cases  postage costs are passed through directly to the customer and are not recognized as revenue 
revenues from software products are recognized per installation and revenues from services are recognized on a percent complete method 
international services revenue for coupon clearing does not include the face value of the coupons processed or the retailer service fee 
however  customers are billed for the face value and retailer fee which are included in both accounts receivable and accounts payable 
once coupon processing has been completed  fee revenues are recognized 
stock compensation valassis grants stock options to its employees under various incentive plans 
options are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value on the date of grant 
we account for all options under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and make various estimates used in calculating the pro forma results as required by sfas no 
valassis will adopt sfas no 
r  as required  in derivative financial instruments valassis uses derivative financial instruments  including forward foreign exchange and swap contracts  to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the use of these financial instruments mitigates our exposure to these risks with the intent of reducing the risks and the variability of our operating results 
valassis is not a party to leveraged derivatives 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  valassis designates the derivative as either a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation a net investment hedge 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet 
when the underlying hedged transaction is realized  the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings and reflected in the consolidated statement of income on the same line as the hedged item 
in addition  both changes in the fair value excluded from our effectiveness assessments and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value are recorded in earnings and reflected in the consolidated statement of income as other expense  net 
valassis formally documents its hedge relationships  including the identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction 
derivatives are recorded at fair value in other current and long term assets and other current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
this process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets  liabilities  firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether a derivative used in a hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting 
hedge ineffectiveness  determined in accordance with sfas no 
 did not have a material impact on operations for or no cash flow hedges were re designated or discontinued during or other matters valassis does not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities 
business outlook the following statements are based on expectations as of the filing of this document 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
valassis expects earnings per share for to be between and  based upon the following assumptions for the full year  the company expects revenue to be up by a mid single digit percentage 
free standing insert fsi revenues are expected to be down by a percentage in the low single digits due to lower pricing on contracts negotiated in and that will affect co op fsi business placed in cost of goods sold on a cpm basis for the fsi is expected to be up by a percentage in the low single digits due to anticipated increases in paper costs 
run of press rop revenues and net operating profits are expected to be up to year over year 
cluster targeted revenues are expected to be up to 
to revenues are expected to be up to 
international services revenues are expected to be up by a percentage in the mid single digits 
sg a is expected to be up approximately 
free cash flow after capital expenditures is projected to be between million to million for the year 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in risk factors a wide range of factors could materially affect the company s future developments and performance  particularly the statements made in the business outlook section 
general factors affecting our operations and future financial performance include the following risk factors relating to our business increased competition could reduce the demand for our products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects our mass products compete in the cooperative fsi business principally with news america marketing  a company owned by the news corporation 
we compete for business primarily on the basis of the following price  category availability  targeting ability  ability to integrate with other products  program development consulting  and customer services and sales relationships 
in the past  new competitors have tried to establish themselves in the fsi market 
during such times  the number of fsi programs increased  resulting in periods of intense price competition and higher costs due to a decrease in pages per fsi program 
should a new competitor try to enter the fsi market in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
our principal competitor in the cooperative fsi market  news america marketing  has been competing aggressively for fsi business 
as a consequence  prices trended downward in although we were able to regain some market share in in comparison to and the industry grew by a percentage in the mid single digits 
the combination of these factors has resulted in a slight increase in revenues and declining profitability for our fsi business 
during the third quarter of  we announced a strategy to increase valassis pricing without a loss of market share 
the results of this strategy remain inconclusive and a continuation or acceleration of these competitive trends could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we compete with media other than cooperative fsis for the promotion and marketing dollars of our customers 
it is possible that alternative media or changes in promotional strategies could make fsis less attractive to our customers or could cause a shift in their preference to different promotional materials or coupon delivery modes 
in addition  some of our competitors  particularly news america  have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
our mass products also compete with several newspaper network groups in the run of press rop market 
while entering the rop business does not require a significant investment in machinery and equipment  it does require a significant investment in systems and people in order to compete in today s environment 
an increase in the number of rop competitors could result in a loss of market share 
our cluster targeted segment competes against commercial printers and media placement agencies for solo specialized promotional programs for single advertisers 
while both types of competitors have a history of competing on the basis of price to increase volume and improve economies of scale  commercial printers tend to be particularly aggressive during periods when they have overcapacity 
in addition  we compete with sunflower marketing for polybag advertising and sampling 
to the extent our competitors in these businesses decide to compete more aggressively on price due to excess capacity or for other reasons it could materially negatively effect our revenue and profit margins 
significant increases in the cost of paper which we cannot control could adversely affect our financial health our paper prices have historically experienced significant fluctuations 
we have a limited ability to protect ourselves from these fluctuations or to pass increased costs along to our customers 
we maintain on average less than days of paper inventory 
significant increases in the cost of paper could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
to protect valassis against the risk of price fluctuations  a significant portion of our paper requirements is purchased from two paper companies under long term contracts 
these contracts limit the amount of increases or decreases to approximately in any calendar year of valassis cost of paper purchased from these suppliers 
such cost can be adjusted quarterly 
as of january   approximately of our fsi paper requirements were purchased pursuant to certain long term paper contracts which limit our exposure with respect to the price of paper during the term of those contracts 
however  we cannot assure you that when such contracts expire that we will be able to replace such contracts with favorable terms or at all 
significant increases in our media rates could adversely affect our financial performance and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under these notes currently  our largest cost component of our business is our media cost  the payments that we make to newspapers for insertion of promotional materials 
at this time  we have certain long term contracts with newspapers providing for these services 
we cannot assure you that when these newspaper contracts expire that we will be able to replace such contracts with favorable terms or at all 
consequently  an increase in media costs could adversely affect our profitability 
the uncertainty of current economic and political conditions make budgeting and forecasting difficult and may reduce sales promotion spending the future direction of the overall domestic and global economies could have a significant impact on our overall performance 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  increased global conflicts and the escalation of existing conflicts has created worldwide uncertainties that may have a negative impact demand for our products 
because all components of our budgeting and forecasting  as well as that of our customers  are dependent upon estimates of growth in the markets we and our customers serve and demand for our and their products  the prevailing economic uncertainties may render estimates of future income and expenditures even more difficult than usual to make 
these risk factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements is illustrative  but by no means exhaustive 
accordingly  all forward looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are foreign exchange rates at valassis international subsidiaries  interest rates on various debt instruments and credit risk on investments 
foreign currency currencies to which valassis has exposure are the mexican peso  canadian dollar  british pound and the euro 
currency restrictions are not expected to have a significant effect on our cash flows  liquidity  or capital resources 
valassis typically purchases the mexican peso under three to month forward foreign exchange contracts to stabilize the cost of production in mexico 
under sfas no 
 our mexican peso forward exchange contracts meet the definition of a cash flow hedge 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized market value gain of  in other comprehensive income 
actual exchange losses or gains are recorded against production expense when the contracts are executed 
as of december   valassis had a commitment to purchase million in mexican pesos over the next months 
interest rates valassis has a revolving line of credit of million with a variable rate of interest calculated on either a euro currency based rate or a prime rate 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance under this line of credit and  therefore  no exposure to interest rate risk 
by balancing the mix of variable versus fixed rate borrowings  valassis manages the interest rate risk of its long term debt 
in june  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements whereby we swapped fixed rates under our senior notes due for variable rates equal to three month average libor  plus the applicable margin of approximately basis points on million notional value of debt 
three month libor was approximately basis points as of december  valassis has performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a or approximately basis points adverse movement in rates applicable to our variable interest rate swap 
as of december   the analysis indicated that such movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations
