item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview usg corporation the corporation and of its united states subsidiaries collectively  the debtors are currently operating under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code 
the debtors took this action to resolve asbestos claims in a fair and equitable manner  to protect the long term value of the debtors businesses  and to maintain the debtors leadership positions in their markets 
to properly understand the corporation and its businesses  investors  creditors or other readers of this report should first understand the nature of this voluntary reorganization process under chapter and the potential impacts the reorganization may have on their rights and interests in the corporation as described in more detail below 
at this point  there is great uncertainty as to the amount of the debtors asbestos liability and thus the value of any recovery for pre petition creditors or stockholders under any final plan of reorganization 
no plan of reorganization has thus far been proposed by the debtors 
the corporation had  million of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities as of december   and management believes that this liquidity plus expected operating cash flows will meet the corporation s cash needs  including making regular capital investments to maintain and enhance its businesses  throughout the chapter proceedings 
the corporation achieved record net sales in  surpassing net sales by 
demand for products sold by the corporation s north american gypsum and building products distribution operating segments was strong in due to growth in the new housing and repair and remodel markets 
the corporation s worldwide ceilings operating segment also reported increased net sales as compared with primarily due to higher selling prices for ceiling grid and tile 
shipments of gypsum wallboard were at record levels for the corporation and the industry in and are expected to be strong in the favorable level of activity in the aforementioned markets and industry capacity utilization rates in excess of have resulted in a rise in market selling prices for gypsum wallboard 
the nationwide average realized selling price for united states gypsum company s sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard was up from the corporation s gross margin was in  up from in gross margin improved primarily as a result of higher selling prices for all major product lines 
however  profit margins have been pressured by high levels of costs related to the price of natural gas a major source of energy for the corporation  employee benefits pension and medical insurance for active employees and retirees  the implementation of a new enterprise wide software system and the price of wastepaper used in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard and steel used in the manufacture of ceiling grid 
together  these cost factors added approximately million to cost of products sold in as compared with voluntary reorganization under chapter on june  the petition date  the debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization the filing under the bankruptcy code 
the debtors bankruptcy cases the chapter cases are pending in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the bankruptcy court 
at the time of the filing  debtor united states gypsum company us gypsum  a subsidiary of the corporation  was a defendant in more than  asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
us gypsum was also a defendant in asbestos lawsuits alleging property damage 
in addition  two subsidiaries  debtors l w supply corporation l w supply and beadex manufacturing  llc beadex  were defendants in a small number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
developments in the reorganization proceeding as a consequence of the filing  all asbestos lawsuits and other lawsuits pending against the debtors as of the petition date are stayed  and no party may take any action to pursue or collect pre petition claims except pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court 
the debtors are operating their businesses without interruption as debtors in possession subject to the provisions of the bankruptcy code  and vendors are being paid for goods furnished and services provided after the filing 
the debtors chapter cases are assigned to judge judith k 
fitzgerald  a bankruptcy court judge  and judge joy flowers conti  a district court judge 
judge conti recently entered an order stating that she will hear matters relating to estimation of the debtors liability for asbestos personal injury claims 
other matters will be heard by judge fitzgerald 
three creditors committees  one representing asbestos personal injury claimants the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants  another representing asbestos property damage claimants the official committee of asbestos property damage claimants  and a third representing unsecured creditors the official committee of unsecured creditors  were appointed as official committees in the chapter cases 
the bankruptcy court also appointed dean m 
trafelet as the legal representative for future asbestos claimants in the debtors bankruptcy proceedings 
the debtors intend to address their liability for all present and future asbestos claims  as well as all other pre petition claims  in a plan or plans of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court 
the debtors currently have the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization until june  the debtors may seek one or more additional extensions of the exclusive period depending upon developments in the chapter cases 
any plan of reorganization ultimately approved by the bankruptcy court may include one or more independently administered trusts under section g of the bankruptcy code  which may be funded by the debtors to allow payment of present and future asbestos personal injury claims 
under the bankruptcy code  a plan of reorganization creating a section g trust may be confirmed only if of the asbestos claimants who are affected by the trust and who vote on the plan approve the plan 
section g also requires that such trust own or have the right to acquire if specified contingencies occur a majority of the voting stock of each relevant debtor  its parent corporation  or a subsidiary that is also a debtor 
a plan of reorganization  including a plan creating a section g trust  may be confirmed without the consent of non asbestos creditors and equity security holders if certain requirements of the bankruptcy code are met 
the debtors also expect that the plan of reorganization will address the debtors liability for asbestos property damage claims  whether by including those liabilities in a section g trust or by other means 
if the confirmed plan of reorganization includes the creation and funding of a section g trust relating to one or more of the debtors  the bankruptcy court will issue a permanent injunction barring the assertion of present and future asbestos claims against the relevant debtors  their successors  and their affiliates  and channeling those claims to the trust for payment in whole or in part 
a key factor in determining whether or to what extent there will be any recovery for pre petition creditors or stockholders under any plan of reorganization is the amount that must be provided in the plan to address the debtors liability for present and future asbestos claims 
the amount of the debtors asbestos liabilities has not yet been determined and is subject to substantial uncertainty 
the debtors have stated that they believe they can pay all legitimate asbestos liabilities in full and that the debtors are solvent 
the debtors have requested the court to estimate their asbestos personal injury liabilities taking into account the debtors defenses to these claims 
one of the key issues in estimating the debtors asbestos personal injury liabilities is whether claimants who do not have objective evidence of asbestos related disease have valid claims and whether such claimants  who significantly outnumber cancer claimants  are entitled to vote on a plan of reorganization 
other important estimation issues include the determination of the characteristics and number of present and future claimants who are likely to have had any  or sufficient  exposure to the debtors products  whether the particular type of asbestos present in certain of the debtors products during the relevant time has been shown to cause disease  and what are the appropriate claim values to apply in the estimation process 
the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants and the legal representative for future asbestos claimants have indicated in a court filing that they estimate that the net present value of the debtors liability for present and future asbestos personal injury claims is approximately billion and that the debtors are insolvent 
the committee and the legal representative also contend that the bankruptcy court does not have the power to deny recovery to claimants on the grounds that they do not have objective evidence of disease or do not have adequate exposure to the debtors products where such claimants  or claimants with similar characteristics  are compensated in the tort system outside of bankruptcy 
in addition to the amount of the debtors asbestos liabilities  another key issue to be addressed in these chapter cases is whether the assets of all of the debtors should be available to pay the asbestos liabilities of us gypsum 
in the fourth quarter of  the debtors other than us gypsum filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the bankruptcy court requesting a ruling that the assets of the debtors other than us gypsum are not available to satisfy the asbestos liabilities of us gypsum 
the official committee of unsecured creditors has joined the debtors in this action 
in opposition  the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants  the legal representative for future asbestos claimants  and the official committee of asbestos property damage claimants filed counterclaims asserting that the assets of all debtors should be available to satisfy the asbestos liabilities of us gypsum under various asserted legal grounds  including successor liability  piercing the corporate veil  and substantive consolidation 
if the assets of all debtors are pooled for the payment of all liabilities  including the asbestos liabilities of us gypsum  this could materially and adversely affect the recovery rights of creditors of debtors other than us gypsum as well as the holders of the corporation s equity 
the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants  the legal representative for future asbestos claimants  and the official committee of asbestos property damage claimants have also asserted claims seeking a declaratory judgment that l w supply has direct liability for asbestos personal injury claims on the asserted grounds that l w supply distributed asbestos containing products and assumed the liabilities of former us gypsum subsidiaries that distributed such products 
the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants  the legal representative for future asbestos claimants  and the official committee of asbestos property damage claimants also have asserted in a court filing that the debtors are liable for claims arising from the sale of asbestos containing products by ap green refractories co 
ap green 
they allege that ap gypsum is liable for ap green s liabilities due to ap gypsum s acquisition of ap green in they also allege that the other debtors are liable for us gypsum s liabilities  including the alleged liabilities of us green  under various asserted legal grounds  including successor liability  piercing the corporate veil  and substantive consolidation 
ap green  which manufactured and sold products used in refractories  was acquired by merger into us gypsum in and thereafter operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of us gypsum until  at which time us green became a wholly owned subsidiary of usg corporation 
in  ap green became a publicly traded company when its shares were distributed to the stockholders of usg corporation 
in february  ap green now known as ap green industries  inc as well as its parent company  global industrial technologies  inc  and other affiliates filed voluntary petitions for reorganization through which ap green and its affiliates seek to resolve their asbestos liabilities 
the ap green reorganization proceeding is pending in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania and is captioned in re global industrial technologies  inc case no 

the draft disclosure statement filed in july by the debtors in the ap green reorganization proceedings indicates that  in early  there were  asbestos personal injury claims pending against ap green as well as about  such claims pending against an ap green affiliate  and that ap green estimates that several hundred thousand additional claims will be asserted against it and or its affiliate 
the disclosure statement also indicates that  in early  ap green had approximately million in unpaid pre petition settlements and judgments relating to asbestos personal injury claims 
the disclosure statement does not provide an estimate of the cost of resolving ap green s liability for pending or future asbestos claims 
the corporation does not have sufficient information to predict whether or how any plan of reorganization in the debtors chapter cases might address any liability based on sales of asbestos containing products by ap green 
the corporation also does not have sufficient information to estimate the amount  or range of amounts  of ap green s asbestos liabilities 
if ap gypsum is determined to be liable for the sale of asbestos containing products by ap green or its affiliates  this result likely would materially increase the amount of us gypsum s present and future asbestos liabilities 
such a result could materially and adversely affect the recovery of other debtors pre petition creditors and the corporation s stockholders  depending upon  among other things  the amount of ap green s alleged asbestos liabilities and whether the other debtors are determined to be liable for us gypsum s liabilities  including alleged us green liabilities 
potential federal legislation regarding asbestos personal injury claims during  there were developments regarding potential federal legislation 
on april   the fairness in asbestos injury resolution act of senate bill  the fair bill was introduced in the united states senate 
the fair bill has not been approved by the senate  has not been introduced in the house of representatives  and is not law 
the fair bill introduced in the senate is intended to establish a nationally administered trust fund to compensate asbestos personal injury claimants 
in the fair bill s current form  companies that have made past payments for asbestos personal injury claims would be required to contribute amounts to a national trust fund on a periodic basis that would pay the claims of qualifying asbestos personal injury claimants 
the nationally administered trust fund would be the exclusive remedy for asbestos personal injury claims  and such claims could not be brought in state or federal court as long as such claims are being compensated under the national trust fund 
in the fair bill s current form  the amounts to be paid to the national trust fund are based on an allocation methodology set forth in the fair bill 
the amounts that participants  including the debtors  would be required to pay are not dischargeable in a bankruptcy proceeding 
the fair bill also provides  among other things  that if it is determined that the money in the trust fund is not sufficient to compensate eligible claimants  the claimants and defendants would return to the court system to resolve claims not paid by the national trust fund 
the outcome of the legislative process is inherently speculative  and it cannot be known whether the fair bill or similar legislation will ever be enacted or  even if enacted  what the terms of the final legislation might be 
in addition to the organized plaintiffs bar  many labor organizations  including the afl cio  as well as some senators have indicated that they oppose the fair bill as introduced because  among other things  they believe that the fair bill does not provide sufficient compensation to asbestos claimants 
on april   the senate defeated a motion to proceed with floor consideration of the fair bill 
it is anticipated that a revised version of the fair bill will be introduced in the th congress 
however  it is likely that some of the opponents identified above will remain opposed to the fair bill when it is reintroduced  and whether the fair bill will ever be enacted cannot be predicted 
it is also likely that  even if the fair bill is enacted  the terms of the enacted legislation will differ from those of the fair bill considered in  and those differences may be material to the fair bill s impact on the corporation 
enactment of the fair bill or similar legislation addressing the financial contributions of the debtors for asbestos personal injury claims would have a material impact on the amount of the debtors asbestos personal injury liability and the debtors chapter cases 
estimated cost of asbestos liability prior to the filing  in the fourth quarter of  us gypsum recorded a noncash  pretax provision of million  increasing to  million its total accrued reserve for resolving in the tort system the asbestos claims pending as of december   and expected to be filed through at that time  the estimated range of us gypsum s probable liability for such claims was between million and  million  including defense costs 
these amounts are stated before tax benefit and are not discounted to present value 
as of december   the corporation s accrued reserve for asbestos claims totaled  million 
because of the uncertainties associated with estimating the debtors liability for present and future asbestos claims at this stage of the bankruptcy proceedings  no change has been made to the previously recorded reserve except to reflect certain minor asbestos related costs incurred since the filing 
because the filing and possible federal legislation have changed the basis upon which the debtors asbestos liability would be estimated  there can be no assurance that the current reserve accurately reflects the debtors ultimate liability for pending and future asbestos claims 
at the time the reserve was increased to its current level in december  the reserve was an estimate of the cost of resolving in the tort system us gypsum s asbestos liability for then pending claims and those expected to be filed through because of the filing and the stay of pre petition asbestos lawsuits  the debtors have not participated in the tort system since june and thus cannot measure the recorded reserve against actual experience 
however  the reserve is generally consistent with the amount the corporation estimates that the debtors would be required to pay to resolve all of their asbestos liability if the fair bill  in its current form  is enacted 
as the chapter cases and the legislation process proceed  the debtors likely will gain more information from which a reasonable estimate of the debtors probable liability for present and future asbestos claims can be determined 
if such estimate differs from the existing reserve  the reserve will be adjusted  and it is possible that a charge to results of operations will be necessary at that time 
in such a case  the debtors asbestos liability could vary significantly from the recorded estimate of liability and could be greater than the high end of the range estimated in this difference could be material to the corporation s financial position  cash flows and results of operations in the period recorded 
potential outcomes of the filing while it is the debtors intention to seek a full recovery for their creditors  it is not possible to predict the amount that will have to be provided in the plan of reorganization to address present and future asbestos claims  how the plan of reorganization will treat other pre petition claims  whether there will be sufficient assets to satisfy the debtors pre petition liabilities  and what impact any plan may have on the value of the shares of the corporation s common stock 
the payment rights and other entitlements of pre petition creditors and the corporation s stockholders may be substantially altered by any plan of reorganization confirmed in the chapter cases 
pre petition creditors may receive under the plan of reorganization less than of the face value of their claims  the pre petition creditors of some debtors may be treated differently from the pre petition creditors of other debtors  and the interests of the corporation s stockholders are likely to be substantially diluted or cancelled in whole or in part 
there can be no assurance as to the value of any distributions that might be made under any plan of reorganization with respect to such pre petition claims or equity interests 
it is also not possible to predict how the plan of reorganization will treat intercompany indebtedness  licenses  transfers of goods and services  and other intercompany arrangements  transactions and relationships that were entered into before the petition date 
certain of these intercompany transactions have been challenged by various parties in these chapter cases see developments in the reorganization proceeding  above  and other arrangements  transactions and relationships may be challenged by parties to these chapter cases 
the outcome of such challenges may have an impact on the treatment of various claims under any plan of reorganization

consolidated results of operations net sales net sales were  million in   million in and  million in net sales increased in as compared with reflecting increased sales for all three operating segments 
net sales improved for north american gypsum due to record shipments and higher selling prices for sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard  sheetrock r brand joint compounds  durock r brand cement board and fiberock r brand gypsum fiber panels 
net sales for the building products distribution segment rose due to record shipments and higher selling prices for gypsum wallboard and increased sales of complementary products

net sales increased in as compared with primarily due to increased shipments of sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard  sheetrock r brand joint compounds and durock r brand cement board 
net sales for the building products distribution segment rose in due to increased shipments of gypsum wallboard and increased sales of complementary products 
however  net sales for the worldwide ceilings segment were down slightly as a result of decreased demand for ceiling products 
cost of products sold cost of products sold totaled  million in   million in and  million in cost of products sold increased in and from the respective prior years largely due to increased volume for gypsum wallboard and gypsum related products 
other key factors for the increases in and were higher costs related to the price of natural gas  employee benefits pension and medical insurance for active employees and retirees  the implementation of a new enterprise wide software system  the price of steel used in the manufacture of ceiling grid and  for only  the price of wastepaper used in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard 
these other key factors accounted for approximately million  or  of the total versus increase and approximately million  or  of the total versus increase

selling and administrative expenses include the impact of a bankruptcy court approved key employee retention plan kerp 
expenses associated with this plan amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
kerp expense declined in from prior year levels primarily due to accruals in and of deferred amounts that were paid in the decrease in total selling and administrative expenses versus primarily reflected a million decrease in kerp expense 
reduced expenses for advertising  the impact of a fourth quarter salaried workforce reduction program and other expense reduction initiatives were offset by higher expenses related to employee incentive compensation associated with the attainment of profit goals and employee benefits pension and medical insurance for active employees and retirees 
the increase in total expenses versus primarily reflected i higher expenses related to employee benefits pension and medical insurance for active employees and retirees  which increased million year on year  ii a fourth quarter charge of million for severance related to a salaried workforce reduction of approximately employees and iii a million increase in kerp expense 
these increases were partially offset by a lower level of employee incentive compensation 
chapter reorganization expenses chapter reorganization expenses consisted of the following millions legal and financial advisory fees bankruptcy related interest income total interest expense interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
under sop  virtually all of the corporation s outstanding debt is classified as liabilities subject to compromise  and interest expense on this debt has not been accrued or recorded since the petition date 
contractual interest expense not accrued or recorded on pre petition debt totaled million in  million in and million in this calculation assumes that all such interest was paid when required at the applicable contractual interest rate after giving effect to any applicable default rate 
however  the calculation excludes the impact of any compounding of interest on unpaid interest that may be payable under the relevant contractual obligations  as well as any interest that may be payable under a plan of reorganization to trade or other creditors that are not otherwise entitled to interest under the express terms of their claims 
the impact of compounding alone would have increased the contractual interest expense reported above by million in  million in and million in for financial reporting purposes  no post petition accruals have been made for contractual interest expense not accrued or recorded on pre petition debt 
however  based on discussions with representatives of the official committee of unsecured creditors  the corporation anticipates that the relevant creditors will seek to recover amounts in respect of such unaccrued interest expense on a compounded basis in the chapter cases

north american gypsum for the north american gypsum segment  net sales increased in and in as compared with the respective prior years  while operating profit more than doubled in after declining in united states gypsum company net sales in increased  and operating profit more than doubled compared with primarily due to record shipments and higher selling prices for its major product lines 
strong demand for us gypsum s sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard led to record shipments of billion square feet during  a increase from the previous record of billion square feet in us gypsum s wallboard plants operated at of capacity in  compared with in industry shipments of gypsum wallboard in were up approximately from the nationwide average realized price for sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard was per thousand square feet in  up from in complementary building products also contributed to the favorable results in record shipments and higher selling prices were reported for sheetrock r brand joint compounds  durock r brand cement board and fiberock r brand gypsum fiber panels 
record shipments and improved pricing for all major products as well as the implementation of various cost saving initiatives and improved production efficiencies at us gypsum s wallboard plants more than offset higher manufacturing costs 
the higher costs were primarily attributable to wastepaper a raw material used to produce the facing and backing of gypsum wallboard and natural gas 
comparing with  net sales rose primarily due to increased shipments of sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard  sheetrock r brand joint compounds and durock r brand cement board 
slightly higher selling prices for sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard also contributed to the higher level of sales

us gypsum s wallboard plants operated at of capacity in  compared with in industry shipments of gypsum wallboard were up approximately from the nationwide average realized price for sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard in was per thousand square feet  up from in manufacturing costs increased in primarily due to higher costs related to the price of natural gas and higher employee benefit costs 
however  improved production efficiencies at us gypsum s wallboard plants and hedging activities offset a portion of the cost increase 
cgc inc the gypsum business of canada based cgc inc

worldwide ceilings for the worldwide ceilings segment  net sales and operating profit in increased and  respectively  from comparing with  net sales for the segment were down slightly  while operating profit increased 
however  as explained below  the increase in operating profit was largely due to an million charge recorded in for the downsizing of european operations 
usg interiors  inc net sales and operating profit in for the corporation s domestic ceilings business  usg interiors  inc usg interiors  rose and  respectively  from these increases primarily reflected higher selling prices for ceiling grid and tile  while shipments of these product lines were virtually unchanged 
steel is a major component in the production of ceiling grid  and in the first half of  market concerns over a global steel shortage and rising steel costs led to a surge in demand for ceiling grid 
in the second half of  demand for grid dropped sharply as a result of the pre buying in the first half of the year 
in addition  the cost of steel rose throughout the year  leading to higher costs to produce grid and inventory steel 
while the corporation expects the availability of steel to generally remain tight and steel prices to remain high  the corporation does not anticipate a shortage of steel for use in the manufacture of its ceiling grid products in net sales for usg interiors were down in versus as lower shipments of ceiling tile and grid were offset to a large extent by improved pricing for most of its ceiling product lines 
a decline in operating profit primarily reflected increases in the costs of natural gas  steel and employee benefits 
usg international usg international reported a increase in net sales  while operating profit rose to million from million in primarily due to increased demand for ceiling grid in europe and the favorable effects of currency translation 
profitability also improved in versus following the shutdown of the aubange  belgium  plant and other downsizing activities in the fourth quarter of an operating loss in included an million charge related to management s decision to shut down the aubange  belgium  ceiling tile plant and other downsizing activities that addressed the weakness of the commercial ceilings market in europe 
this charge was included in cost of products sold 
building products distribution l w supply  the leading specialty building products distribution business in the united states  reported increases in net sales and operating profit of and  respectively  in as compared with these increases primarily reflected record shipments and higher selling prices for gypsum wallboard sold by l w supply 
increased sales of complementary building products such as drywall metal  ceiling products  joint compound and roofing also contributed to the improved results 
shipments of gypsum wallboard were up  while selling prices rose compared with l w supply remains focused on opportunities to profitably grow its specialty business  as well as optimize asset utilization 
as part of its plan  l w supply acquired three locations  opened one location and consolidated one location during  leaving a total of locations in the united states as of december   compared with and locations as of december  and  respectively 
comparing with  net sales and operating profit increased and  respectively 
these increases reflected record shipments of gypsum wallboard and complementary building products 
shipments of gypsum wallboard increased  while selling prices declined compared with market conditions and outlook industry shipments of gypsum wallboard in the united states were an estimated billion square feet in  an all time record and an increase from billion square feet in the new housing market continued on a record setting pace in based on preliminary data issued by the us bureau of the census  us housing starts in were an estimated million units  the highest level since  compared with actual housing starts of million units in and million units in the repair and remodel market  which includes renovation of both residential and nonresidential buildings  accounts for the second largest portion of the corporation s sales  behind new housing construction 
because many buyers begin to remodel an existing home within two years of purchase  opportunity from the residential repair and remodel market in was strong  as sales of existing homes in are estimated at million units  exceeding s record setting level of million units 
the growth in new housing and a strong level of residential remodeling resulted in the record shipments of gypsum wallboard described above 
these two markets  which together account for nearly two thirds of all demand for gypsum wallboard  and utilization rates in excess of for the industry resulted in a rise of market selling prices for gypsum wallboard in future demand for the corporation s products from new nonresidential construction is determined by floor space for which contracts are signed 
installation of gypsum and ceilings products follows signing of construction contracts by about a year 
floor space for which contracts were signed was at historically low levels in and as commercial construction was affected by reduced corporate earnings  resulting in lower investments in office and other commercial space 
however  current information indicates that the decline in floor space for which contracts were signed leveled off in  and a modest increase was experienced in the outlook for the corporation s markets in is positive 
however  a decline in housing starts and increasing interest rates could reduce the level of demand from both the new housing and residential remodeling markets 
while office vacancy rates currently remain at relatively high levels  the commercial construction market  the principal market for the corporation s ceilings products  is showing signs of improvement 
in addition  the corporation  like many other companies  faces many ongoing cost pressures such as higher prices for natural gas and raw materials and increased costs for employee benefits 
in this environment  the corporation continues to focus its management attention and investments on improving customer service  manufacturing costs and operating efficiencies  as well as investing to grow its businesses 
in addition  the corporation will diligently continue its attempt to resolve the chapter proceedings  consistent with the goal of achieving a fair  comprehensive and final resolution to its asbestos liability

capital expenditure commitments also include a mill modernization project for the plaster city  calif  gypsum wallboard plant 
construction on these projects will begin in  and their costs will be funded by cash from operations 
during the bankruptcy proceeding  the corporation expects to have limited ability to access capital other than its own cash  marketable securities and future cash flows to fund potential future growth opportunities such as new products  acquisitions and joint ventures

critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the corporation believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
voluntary reorganization under chapter as a result of the filing  the corporation s consolidated financial statements reflect the provisions of sop and are prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
however  as a result of the filing  such realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities  without substantial adjustments and or changes of ownership  are subject to uncertainty 
given this uncertainty  there is substantial doubt about the corporation s ability to continue as a going concern 
such doubt includes  but is not limited to  a possible change in control of the corporation  as well as a potential change in the composition of the corporation s business portfolio 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
while operating as debtors in possession under the protection of chapter of the bankruptcy code and subject to bankruptcy court approval or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business  one or more of the debtors may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
further  a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications in the historical consolidated financial statements 
one of the key provisions of sop requires the reporting of the debtors liabilities incurred prior to the commencement of the chapter cases as liabilities subject to compromise 
the various liabilities that are subject to compromise include us gypsum s asbestos reserve and the debtors pre petition debt  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other long term liabilities 
the amounts for these items represent the debtors estimate of known or potential pre petition claims to be resolved in connection with the chapter cases 
such claims remain subject to future adjustments 
adjustments may result from i negotiations  ii actions of the bankruptcy court  iii further developments with respect to disputed claims  iv rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases  v the determination as to the value of any collateral securing claims  vi proofs of claim  including unaccrued and unrecorded post petition interest expense  vii effect of any legislation which may be enacted or viii other events 
in particular  the amount of the asbestos reserve reflects us gypsum s pre petition estimate of liability associated with asbestos claims expected to be filed against us gypsum in the tort system through  and this liability  in addition to liability for post claims  is the subject of significant dispute in the chapter cases 
other provisions of sop involve interest expense and interest income 
interest expense on debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise is not accrued or recorded 
interest income on cash accumulated during the bankruptcy process to settle claims under a plan of reorganization is netted against chapter reorganization expenses 
see part ii  item  note  voluntary reorganization under chapter  for additional information related to the filing 
asbestos liability in  prior to the filing  an independent consultant completed an actuarial study of us gypsum s current and potential future asbestos liabilities 
this study was based on the assumption that us gypsum s asbestos liability would continue to be resolved in the tort system 
as part of this study  the corporation and its independent consultant considered various factors that would impact the amount of us gypsum s asbestos personal injury liability 
these factors included the number  disease  age  and occupational characteristics of claimants in the personal injury cases  the jurisdiction and venue in which such cases were filed  the viability of claims for conspiracy or punitive damages  the elimination of indemnity sharing among members of the center for claims resolution the center  including us gypsum  for future settlements and its negative impact on us gypsum s ability to continue to resolve claims at historical or acceptable levels  the adverse impact on us gypsum s settlement costs of recent bankruptcies of co defendants  the possibility of additional bankruptcies of other defendants  the possibility of significant adverse verdicts due to recent changes in settlement strategies and related effects on liquidity  the inability or refusal of former center members to fund their share of existing settlements and its effect on such settlement agreements  allegations that us gypsum and the other center members are responsible for the share of certain settlement agreements that was to be paid by former members that have refused or are unable to pay  the continued ability to negotiate settlements or develop other mechanisms that defer or reduce claims from unimpaired claimants  the possibility that federal legislation addressing asbestos litigation would be enacted  epidemiological data concerning the incidence of past and projected future asbestos related diseases  trends in the propensity of persons alleging asbestos related disease to sue us gypsum  the pre agreed settlement recommendations in  and the viability of  the long term settlements entered into by us gypsum when it was a member of the center  anticipated trends in recruitment of non malignant or unimpaired claimants by plaintiffs law firms  and future defense costs 
the study attempted to weigh relevant variables and assess the impact of likely outcomes on future case filings and settlement costs 
in connection with the property damage cases  the corporation considered  among other things  the extent to which claimants could identify the manufacturer of any alleged asbestos containing products in the buildings at issue in each case  the amount of asbestos containing products at issue  the claimed damages  the viability of statute of limitations and other defenses  the amount for which such cases can be resolved  which normally but not uniformly has been substantially lower than the claimed damages  and the viability of claims for punitive and other forms of multiple damages 
based upon the results of the actuarial study  the corporation determined that  although substantial uncertainty remained  it was probable that asbestos claims then pending against us gypsum and future asbestos claims to be filed against it through both property damage and personal injury could be resolved in the tort system for an amount between million and  million  including defense costs  and that within this range the most likely estimate was  million 
consistent with this analysis  in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a noncash  pretax charge of million to results of operations  which  combined with the previously existing reserve  increased us gypsum s reserve for asbestos claims to  million 
these amounts are stated before tax benefit and are not discounted to present value 
less than of the reserve was attributable to defense and administrative costs 
at the time of recording this reserve  it was expected that the reserve amounts would be expended over a period extending several years beyond  because asbestos cases in the tort system historically had been resolved an average of three years after filing 
the corporation concluded that it did not have adequate information to allow it to reasonably estimate us gypsum s liability for asbestos claims to be filed after because of the filing and activities relating to potential federal legislation addressing asbestos personal injury claims  the corporation believes that there is greater uncertainty in estimating the reasonably possible range of the debtors liability for pending and future asbestos claims as well as the most likely estimate of liability within this range 
there are significant differences in the treatment of asbestos claims in a bankruptcy proceeding as compared to the tort litigation system 
the factors that impact the estimation of liability for pending and future asbestos claims in a bankruptcy proceeding and the amount that must be provided in the plan of reorganization for such liabilities include i the number of present and future asbestos claims that will be addressed in the plan of reorganization  ii the value that will be paid to present and future claims  including the impact historical settlement values for asbestos claims may have on the estimation of asbestos liability in the bankruptcy proceedings  iii how claims by individuals who have no objective evidence of impairment will be treated in the bankruptcy proceedings and plan of reorganization  iv how us gypsum s long term settlements when it was a member of the center will be treated in the plan of reorganization and whether those settlements will be set aside  v how claims for punitive damages will be treated  vi the results of any litigation proceedings in the chapter cases regarding the estimated number or value of present and future asbestos personal injury claims  vii the treatment of asbestos property damage claims in the bankruptcy proceedings  viii the potential asbestos liability of l w supply  beadex  ap green or any other past or present affiliates of the debtors and how any such liability will be addressed in the bankruptcy proceedings and plan of reorganization  ix whether the assets of all of the debtors are determined to be available to satisfy the asbestos liabilities of us gypsum  x how the requirement of section g that of the voting asbestos claimants approve the plan of reorganization will impact the amount that must be provided in the plan of reorganization for pending and future asbestos claims and xi the impact any relevant potential federal legislation may have on the proceedings 
see part ii  item  note  voluntary reorganization under chapter potential federal legislation regarding asbestos personal injury claims 
in addition  the estimates of the debtors asbestos liability that would be recorded as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings or potential federal legislation are likely to include all expected future asbestos cases to be brought against the debtors as opposed to the cases filed over a three year period and are likely to be computed using the present value of the estimated liability 
these factors  as well as the uncertainties discussed above in connection with the resolution of asbestos cases in the tort system  increase the uncertainty of any estimate of asbestos liability 
because of the uncertainties associated with estimating the debtors asbestos liability at this stage of the proceedings  no change has been made at this time to the previously recorded reserve for asbestos claims  except to reflect certain minor asbestos related costs incurred since the filing 
the reserve as of december   was  million 
because the filing and possible federal legislation have changed the basis upon which the debtors asbestos liability would be estimated  there can be no assurance that the current reserve accurately reflects the debtors ultimate liability for pending and future asbestos claims 
at the time the reserve was increased to its current level in december  the reserve was an estimate of the cost of resolving in the tort system us gypsum s asbestos liability for then pending claims and those expected to be filed through because of the filing and the stay of pre petition asbestos lawsuits  the debtors have not participated in the tort system since june and thus cannot measure the recorded reserve against actual experience 
however  the reserve is generally consistent with the amount the corporation estimates that the debtors would be required to pay to resolve all of their asbestos liability if the fair bill  in its current form  is enacted 
as the chapter cases and the legislation process proceed  the debtors likely will gain more information from which a reasonable estimate of the debtors probable liability for present and future asbestos claims can be determined 
if the fair bill or similar legislation is not enacted  the debtors asbestos liability  as determined through the bankruptcy proceedings  could be materially greater than the accrued reserve 
the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants and the legal representative for future asbestos claimants have indicated in a court filing that they estimate that the net present value of the debtors liability for present and future asbestos personal injury claims is approximately billion and that the debtors are insolvent 
the debtors have stated that they believe they are solvent if their asbestos liabilities are fairly and appropriately valued 
when the debtors determine that there is a reasonable basis for revision of the estimate of their asbestos liability  the reserve will be adjusted  and it is possible that a charge to results of operations will be necessary at that time 
in such a case  the debtors asbestos liability could vary significantly from the recorded estimate of liability 
this difference could be material to the corporation s financial position  cash flows and results of operations in the period recorded 
see part ii  item  note  litigation  for additional information on the background of asbestos litigation  developments in the corporation s reorganization proceeding and defined terms 
employee retirement plans the corporation and its major subsidiaries generally have contributory defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees 
plans that provide postretirement benefits retiree health care and life insurance for eligible employees also are maintained by the corporation 
for accounting purposes  these plans are dependent on assumptions made by management which are used by actuaries engaged by the corporation to calculate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the annual expense recognized for these plans 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates primarily include discount rates  expected return on plan assets for the funded plans  compensation increase rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and  for postretirement benefits  health care cost trend rates 
the assumed discount rate is developed by using  as a benchmark  the yield on investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better with terms that approximate the average duration of the corporation s obligations 
the use of a different discount rate would impact net pension and postretirement benefit costs and benefit obligations 
in determining the expected return on plan assets  the corporation uses a building block approach  which incorporates historical experience  its pension plan investment guidelines and expectations for long term rates of return 
the use of a different rate of return would impact net pension costs 
a one half percentage point change in the assumed discount rate and return on plan asset rate would have the following effects dollars in millions increase decrease in projected net annual benefit assumption change benefit cost obligation pension benefits discount rate increase discount rate decrease asset return increase asset return decrease postretirement benefits discount rate increase discount rate decrease compensation increase rates are based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience  while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality rates 
health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data and an assessment of likely long term trends 
results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the net benefit cost of future periods 
the sensitivity of assumptions reflects the impact of changing one assumption at a time and is specific to conditions at the end of economic factors and conditions could affect multiple assumptions simultaneously  and the effects of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear 
see part ii  item  note  employee retirement plans  for additional information regarding costs  plan obligations  plan assets and assumptions 
self insurance reserves the corporation purchases insurance from third parties for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability claims that exceed certain levels 
however  the corporation is responsible for the payment of claims up to such levels 
in estimating the obligation associated with incurred and incurred but not reported losses  the corporation utilizes estimates prepared by actuarial consultants 
these estimates utilize the corporation s historical data to project the future development of losses and take into account the impact of the corporation s bankruptcy proceedings 
the corporation monitors and reviews all estimates and related assumptions for reasonableness 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
revenue recognition for the majority of the corporation s sales  revenue is recognized upon the shipment of products to customers  which is when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
however  for the corporation s building products distribution segment  revenue is recognized and title and risk of loss are transferred when customers receive products  either through delivery by company trucks or customer pickup 
the corporation believes that these revenue recognition points are appropriate  as the corporation has no further performance obligations unless the customer notifies the corporation of shortage of products or defective products shipped within five days after receipt of such products 
with the exception of building products distribution  the corporation s products are generally shipped free on board fob shipping point 
provisions for discounts to customers are recorded based on the terms of sale in the same period in which the related sales are recorded 
the corporation also records estimated reductions to revenue for shortage of products or defective products  customer programs and incentive offerings  including promotions and other volume based incentives  based on historical information and review of major customer activity 
recent accounting pronouncements see part ii  item  note  significant accounting policies  for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on the corporation 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements related to management s expectations about future conditions 
the effects of the filing and the conduct  outcome and costs of the chapter cases  as well as the ultimate costs associated with the corporation s asbestos litigation  including the possible impact of any asbestos related legislation  may differ from management s expectations 
actual business  market or other conditions may also differ from management s expectations and accordingly affect the corporation s sales and profitability or other results 
actual results may differ due to various other factors  including economic conditions such as the levels of construction activity  employment levels  interest rates  currency exchange rates and consumer confidence  competitive conditions such as price and product competition  shortages in raw materials  increases in raw material  energy and employee benefit costs  loss of one or more significant customers  and the unpredictable effects of acts of terrorism or war upon domestic and international economies and financial markets 
the corporation assumes no obligation to update any forward looking information contained in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the corporation uses financial instruments  including fixed and variable rate debt  to finance its operations in the normal course of business 
in addition  the corporation uses derivative instruments from time to time to manage selected commodity price and foreign currency exposures 
the corporation does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the corporation has interest rate risk with respect to the fair market value of its investment portfolio 
derivative instruments are used to enhance the liquidity of the marketable securities portfolio 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists of debt instruments that generate interest income for the corporation on excess cash balances generated during the corporation s chapter bankruptcy proceeding 
a portion of these instruments contain embedded derivative features that enhance the liquidity of the portfolio by enabling the corporation to liquidate the instrument prior to the stated maturity date  thus shortening the average duration of the portfolio to less than one year 
based on results of a sensitivity analysis  for a hypothetical change in interest rates of basis points  the potential change in the fair market value of the corporation s portfolio is million 
commodity price risk the corporation uses swap contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices associated with anticipated purchases of natural gas 
generally  the corporation has a substantial majority of its anticipated purchases of natural gas over the next months hedged  however  the corporation reviews its positions regularly and makes adjustments as market conditions warrant 
a sensitivity analysis was prepared to estimate the potential change in the fair value of the corporation s natural gas swap contracts assuming a hypothetical change in market prices 
based on results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  the potential change in the fair value of the corporation s natural gas swap contracts is million 
this analysis does not consider the underlying exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk the corporation has operations in a number of countries and uses forward contracts from time to time to hedge selected risk of changes in cash flows resulting from forecasted intercompany and third party sales or purchases denominated in non us currencies 
as of december   the corporation had no outstanding forward contracts
