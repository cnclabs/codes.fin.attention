item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
dollars are in millions  except per share amounts 
percentages are approximate 
general cytec industries inc is a global specialty chemicals and materials company and sells its products to diverse major markets for aerospace  automotive and industrial coatings  chemical intermediates  mining  plastics and water treatment 
with slightly over half of the company s sales outside of the us  sales volume by region and the impact of exchange rates are important measures that are analyzed by management 
the company reports its net sales in four segments water and industrial process chemicals  performance products  specialty materials and building block chemicals 
the water and industrial process chemicals and performance products segments are collectively referred to as specialty chemicals 
the company also reports its net sales in four geographic regions north america  latin america  asia pacific and europe middle east africa 
the destination of the sale determines the region under which it is reported consistent with management s view of the business 
north america consists of the united states and canada 
latin america includes mexico  central america  south america and the caribbean islands 
asia pacific is comprised of asia  australia and the islands of the south pacific rim 
raw material cost changes year on year are an important factor in profitability especially in years of high volatility 
oil and natural gas costs are significantly higher than the year ago period and many of the company s raw materials are derived from these two commodities 
key raw materials for the specialty chemicals and building block chemicals segments are propylene  ammonia  methanol derivatives and natural gas for utilities 
key raw materials for the specialty materials segment are carbon fiber and various resins 
discussion of the year to year impact of raw materials and energy is provided in our segment discussion 
in addition  higher global demand levels and  occasionally  operating difficulties at suppliers  have limited the availability of certain of the company s raw materials 
with the exception of propylene availability in the first quarter  this did not have a material impact on results of operations in the company was recently notified by its major supplier of propylene that as of february   it will be placed on an supply allocation of its requirements for up to six months due to mechanical difficulties 
management does not expect this allocation to have a material impact on company operations in the first quarter of should it occur for the term anticipated 
in the course of the company s ongoing operations  a number of strategic product line acquisitions and dispositions have been made 
all acquisitions have been recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in the company s consolidated results from the dates of the respective acquisitions 
a further discussion of acquisitions and dispositions can be found in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein

year ended december   compared with year ended december  consolidated results net sales for were  compared with  during all segments reported increased sales 
in the two specialty chemicals segments sales increased primarily due to increased selling volumes  the acquisitions completed in the second half of and favorable exchange rates 
the specialty materials segment sales increase was primarily volume related and all product lines participated 
the building block chemicals segment sales increased principally due to higher selling prices which were driven by higher raw material and energy costs offset somewhat by a decrease in sales volumes of acrylonitrile and acrylamide 
for a detailed discussion on sales refer to the segment results section below 
manufacturing cost of sales was  compared with  during cost of sales was primarily impacted by higher raw material and energy costs of gross margin percent however  decreased by only as the higher raw material and energy costs were offset by increased selling prices of  the net impact of exchange rates on operations outside of the united states of  the fixed cost leverage from the increased production levels and a favorable product mix 
pension expense increased principally as a result of the company lowering its discount rate in the u 
s 
by to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities and by the acquisitions which increased pension expense by pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales 
refer to critical accounting policies  retirement plans for further discussion on how changes in discount rates and return on asset assumptions can impact annual expense 
selling and technical services was in versus in the prior year due to ongoing costs of the businesses in the specialty chemical segments acquired in the second half of  the impact of exchange rate changes on operations outside of the united states of and higher costs in the specialty materials segment of where the company is investing in personnel  product qualifications and commercialization of new products for its growth initiatives 
research and process development was versus in the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of ongoing costs of the acquired businesses of the specialty chemical segments completed in the second half of  costs associated with the start up of the newly renovated specialty chemicals technology center and higher costs in the specialty materials segment where the company continues to invest for a number of future opportunities 
administrative and general expenses were versus in the prior year 
included in is a charge of related to the settlement of the federal carbon fiber class action lawsuit and several other minor litigation matters 
also contributing to the increase were ongoing costs of the businesses of the specialty chemical segments acquired in the second half of of approximately  an increase in deferred compensation expense of due to the increase in the company s stock price versus the year ago period and the impact of exchange rate changes on operations outside of the us of us additionally  the company incurred in third party expenses related to implementing accounting and disclosure control procedures as required by the sarbanes oxley act of other income  net was compared with a loss of in the prior year 
included in results was a net gain of related to derivative contracts entered into during the fourth quarter to economically hedge currency and interest rate exposure associated with the pending acquisition of surface specialties 
the company entered into foreign currency contracts to offset the potential dollar to euro exchange rate fluctuation that would have an impact on the acquisition cost in dollars and this resulted in a gain of in anticipation of future long term debt that would be issued to partially finance the acquisition  the company also entered into interest rate hedges which resulted in the recognition of a loss of also included in other income  net are charges of for settlement of several environmental remediation and toxic tort lawsuits and a charge of related to the settlement of a series of disputed matters with wyeth  partially offset by a gain of related to the sale in of the company s share of its methanol joint venture whereby the company received additional proceeds because the market price of methanol stayed above an agreed upon index over a predetermined period of time 
the company also recorded in other income  net  of which has been received  that relates to insurance recoveries and expected recoveries from its insurers of lead related defense costs which had been previously expensed 
lead related defense costs recognized during amounted to the prior year loss of primarily resulted from the recognition of currency losses whereby certain international subsidiaries held dollar denominated assets while the us dollar weakened 
equity in earnings of associated companies was versus in the prior year 
earnings from cyro  the company s owned acrylic plastics joint venture  remained flat as compared with the prior year as increased sales volumes and selling prices offset higher raw material costs 
in addition  results for included earnings of from the company s former owned mitsui cytec joint venture 
refer to notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net was compared with in the prior year 
the increase resulted primarily from a higher outstanding weighted average debt balance during the company s effective tax rate in was compared with in this reduction reflects the company s continued earnings growth in lower tax jurisdictions and  to a lesser extent  a favorable international tax ruling received in the first quarter of during the second quarter of  the company recorded a reduction of its tax liabilities due to the completion of several years of tax audits in an international tax jurisdiction that resulted in a reduction of to its income tax provision 
these reductions were partially offset by the derivative net gain noted above which was taxed at the higher incremental us rate 
net earnings available to common stockholders for were per diluted share 
net earnings available to common stockholders for included a charge of per diluted share as a result of the redemption of the company s series c preferred stock the series c stock

the company had of outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds and bank guarantees at december  that are issued on the company s behalf in the ordinary course of business to support certain performance obligations and commitments of the company 
the instruments are typically renewed on an annual basis 
the company does not have any unconsolidated limited purpose entities or any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates  commodity prices  interest rates and equity price changes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
dollars are in millions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  the company may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with company established policies 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
moreover  the company enters into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and makes reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
currency risk the risk of adverse currency rate fluctuations is mitigated by the fact that  except for the currency exposure related to the pending acquisition of surface specialties refer to liquidity and financial condition in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  there is no concentration of currency exposure outside the u 
s 
in addition  the company periodically enters into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business 
at december   the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable  accounts payable and intercompany loans 
when hedging currency exposures  the company s practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
at december   except for the currency hedges entered into as part of the pending acquisition of surface specialties refer to liquidity and financial condition in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the currency and net contractual amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into u 
s 
dollar equivalent amounts were as follows buy pound canadian sell euro sterling dollar u 
s 
dollar euro norwegian krone other the fair value of currency contracts  based on forward exchange rates at december   exceeded contract values by approximately assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the change in the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would be a decrease of approximately however  since these contracts hedge specific transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
assuming that year end dollar to euro exchange rate were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the change in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts associated with the pending acquisition of surface specialties would be a decrease of approximately commodity price risk the company uses natural gas forward contracts  which are physically settled  to hedge certain utility requirements 
the maturities of these contracts correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that the company pays for the underlying commodity 
while these contracts are structured to limit the company s exposure to increases in commodity prices  they can also limit the potential benefit the company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices 
because the company takes physical delivery of the commodity  these contracts are not required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
instead  realized gains and losses are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract 
at december   the building block chemicals segment fortier plant s forecasted natural gas utility requirements were hedged utilizing natural gas forward contracts 
these contracts had a notional value of and have delivery dates from january through december based on year end nymex prices  the company had net unrealized losses on its natural gas forward contracts at december  of assuming that year end natural gas prices were to decrease by a hypothetical  the above loss would be increased by approximately at december  and  the company had outstanding natural gas swaps with a fair value loss of and a fair value gain of  net of taxes  respectively 
interest rate risk at december   the outstanding borrowings of the company consisted of fixed rate long term debt  including the current portion  which had a carrying value of a face value of and a fair value  based on dealer quoted values  of approximately during  the company terminated certain interest rate swaps which had been designated as cash flow hedges 
the net gain thereon of is being amortized over the life of the notes as a decrease to interest expense of such notes 
the amount of the unamortized swap settlement included in long term debt was at december  assuming other factors are held constant  interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt 
accordingly  assuming a hypothetical increase of in interest rates and all other variables remaining constant  interest expense would not change  however  the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease by approximately to hedge the benchmark interest rate and credit spread on a portion of the debt that will be issued to finance the acquisition of surface specialties  the company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps refer to liquidity and financial condition in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
assuming a hypothetical decrease of in interest rates and all other variables remaining constant  the fair value of the forward starting interest rate swaps would decrease by approximately other outlook the company intends to provide its earnings outlook for after it closes on the pending acquisition of surface specialties 
the closing is anticipated to take place about february  and therefore the company anticipates that it will be able to provide its outlook when it reports first quarter earnings in may critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition 
environmental and other contingent liabilities accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation  and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accruals are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities  without any discount to reflect the time value of money 
these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
the amount accrued for environment remediation reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature and cost of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
included in other contingent liabilities are workers compensation  product liability and toxic tort claims 
the amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects the company s assumptions about the incidence  severity  indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims 
accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if the company s assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties 
the company cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts 
moreover  environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period  and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty 
accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses 
probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future costs are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets 
a number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements 
these factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies  how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance polices  the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships  and the company s historical recovery rates over the past ten years 
defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred 
probable insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are accrued when the related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets

retirement plans the company sponsors defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements 
the company s most significant pension plans are in the u 
s  and constituted over of the company s consolidated pension assets and of projected benefit obligations as of december  the calculation of the company s pension expense and pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
the company believes that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  long term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
the company discounted its us future pension liabilities using rates of and at december  and  respectively 
the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense 
for example  a change of a quarter percentage point in either direction in the discount rate would change pension expense by approximately and postretirement benefit expense by a negligible amount 
the decrease in the discount rate assumption is expected to increase the company s net periodic pension expense for the u 
s 
pension plans by approximately million in compared with the company s net periodic benefit expense for the u 
s 
postretirement welfare plans is expected to decrease by approximately million in compared with the expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the long term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the historical returns of major asset classes  the expected investment mix of the plans assets  and estimates of future long term investment returns 
the u 
s 
pension plan s investment mix at december  approximated equities and fixed income securities compared with equities and fixed income securities at december  any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the expected rate of return on assets in the u 
s 
pension plans is for  the same expected return as a change of a quarter percentage point in either direction in the expected rate of return on plan assets would change pension expense by approximately and net postretirement expense by approximately for pension plan and postretirement plan contributions in fiscal are expected to be and  respectively 
the estimate of contributions is based on significant assumptions  such as pension plan benefit levels  interest rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns 
actual contributions could differ from this estimate

impairment of goodwill the company has defined its segments as its sfas no 
reporting units 
the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company uses a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
first  the reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying value 
the company utilizes a market multiple approach to determine fair value estimates 
due to the cyclical nature of the company s reporting unit s  values are determined utilizing a three year average 
the three year period is comprised of the prior year  current year and one year projected amounts 
if the market multiple approach yields a result  which may indicate a possible impairment  a discounted cash flow approach is utilized to more precisely determine the reporting unit s fair value 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
these evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company is not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us or additional non us taxes with respect to these earnings 
in the event of repatriation to the us  such earnings would be subject to us income taxes in most cases 
foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of us tax otherwise payable in future years 
the company s annual effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s annual effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
the company establishes accruals for tax contingencies when  notwithstanding the reasonable belief that its tax return positions are fully supported  the company believes that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover  that such filing positions may not be fully sustained 
the company continually evaluates its tax contingency accruals and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to emerging case law  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the year of resolution 
the company s tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable
