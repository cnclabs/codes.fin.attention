net cash provided from operating activities was million for  a decrease of million compared with the primary contributors to the decrease were reductions in cash provided from deferred income taxes and higher accounts receivable balances at year end 
the decrease in cash provided from deferred income taxes principally reflected the tax impact of the lower pension plan contributions in versus the decreases above were partially offset by higher net income and increases in cash provided from other assets and liabilities and accounts payable 
cash used by other assets and liabilities was million in compared with million in the reduction in the use of cash reflected reduced cash contributions to the company s pension plans which were million lower in compared with  decreased cash provided from commodity transactions primarily reflecting lower commodity futures market prices in  and an increase in cash provided by higher liabilities primarily associated with selling and marketing programs in the increase in cash provided from accounts payable reflected the timing of payments 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following table summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations by year payments due by year in thousands of dollars contractual obligations thereafter total unconditional purchase obligations non cancelable operating leases long term debt total obligations in entering into contractual obligations  the company has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
the company s risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
the company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults 
the company has entered into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials 
purchase obligations primarily reflect forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third party brokers and dealers to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations 
total obligations for each year are comprised of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that have been valued using market prices as of december  the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods 
however  the variability of such costs is mitigated to the extent of the company s futures price cover for those periods 
accordingly  increases or decreases in market prices will be offset by gains or losses on commodity futures contracts to the extent that the unpriced contracts are hedged as of december  and in future periods 
taking delivery of the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies these obligations 
for each of the three years in the period ended december   such obligations were fully satisfied by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
interpretation no 

interpretation no 
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of special purpose entities spes  such as spts  to which the usual condition for consolidation described in accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  does not apply because the spes have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests 
the company adopted interpretation no 
as of june   resulting in the consolidation of three off balance sheet arrangements with spts 
as of december  and  the company had no off balance sheet arrangements 
the consolidation of the spts resulted in an adjustment to record the cumulative effect of the accounting change of approximately million  or 
per share diluted  in the third quarter of  reflecting the after tax effect of accumulated depreciation for these facilities from lease inception through june  additionally  the consolidation of these entities resulted in a net increase to property  plant and equipment of approximately million  with a corresponding increase to long term debt of million and to other long term liabilities of million  reflecting the third party equity interest associated with the lease arrangements 
prior to june   expenses associated with the lease arrangements were classified as rent expense and included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income 
subsequent to the consolidation of these entities  expenses were classified as interest expense associated with the corresponding long term debt 
the consolidation of these entities resulted in an increase to interest expense of million in  offset by a decrease in rental expense for these facilities included in cost of sales 
an increase in depreciation expense of million in also resulted from the consolidation of these entities  with a total of million of depreciation expense recorded in during and  the company entered into off balance sheet arrangements for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities 
these off balance sheet arrangements enabled the company to lease these facilities under more favorable terms than other leasing alternatives 
the lease arrangements are with spts whereby the company leases warehouse and distribution facilities in redlands  california  atlanta  georgia  and hershey  pennsylvania  as discussed below 
the spts were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent leasing of the facilities to the company 
the spts financed the acquisition of the facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent third party financial institutions 
the independent third party financial institutions that hold the equity certificates are the owners of the spts 
the owners of the spts have made substantive residual equity capital investments in excess of which will be at risk during the entire term of each lease 
accordingly  the company did not consolidate the spts prior to june  because all of the conditions for consolidation had not been met 
in december  the company entered into a lease agreement with the owner of the warehouse and distribution facility in redlands  california 
the lease term was approximately ten years  with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility 
the lease agreement contained an option for the company to purchase the facility 
in january  the company assigned its right to purchase the facility to an spt that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to the company under a new lease agreement 
the lease term is five years  with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor 
the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility  including land  was million 
in october  the company entered into a lease agreement with an spt for the leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility near atlanta  georgia 
the lease term is five years  with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor 
the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility  including land  was million 
in july  the company entered into a lease agreement with an spt for the construction and leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility located on land owned by the company near hershey  pennsylvania 
under the agreement  the lessor paid construction costs totaling million 
the lease term is six years  including the one year construction period  with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor 
aside from the residual guarantees and instrument guarantees associated with the individual leasing arrangements  as discussed below  the company has provided no other guarantees or capitalization of these entities 
the company has not collateralized the obligations in connection with these leases 
the company has no obligations with respect to refinancing of the lessor s debt  would incur no significant penalties which would result in the reasonable assurance of continuation of the leases and has no significant guarantees other than the residual and instrument guarantees discussed below 
there are no other material commitments or contingent liabilities associated with the leasing arrangements 
the company s transactions with the spts are limited to the lease agreements 
the company does not anticipate entering into any other arrangements involving spes 
the leases include substantial residual guarantees by the company for a significant amount of the financing and options to purchase the facilities at original cost 
pursuant to instrument guarantees  in the event of a default under the lease agreements  the company guaranteed to the note holders and certificate holders payment in an amount equal to all sums then due under the leases 
there are no penalties or other disincentives under the lease agreements if the company decides not to renew any of the three leases 
the terms for each renewal period under each of the three lease arrangements are identical to the initial terms and do not represent bargain lease terms 
if the company were to exercise its options to purchase the three facilities at original cost at the end of the respective initial lease terms  the company could purchase the facilities for a total of approximately million  million for the pennsylvania and georgia facilities in and million for the california facility in if the company chooses not to renew the leases or purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms  the company is obligated under the residual guarantees for approximately million in total for the three leases 
additionally  the company is obligated to re market each property on the lessor s behalf and  upon sale  distribute a portion of the proceeds to the note holders and certificate holders up to an amount equal to the remaining debt and equity certificates and to pay closing costs 
if the company chooses not to renew or purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms  the company does not anticipate a material disruption to operations  since such facilities are not unique  facilities with similar racking and storage capabilities are available in each of the areas where the facilities are located  there are no significant leasehold improvements that would be impaired  there would be no adverse tax consequences  the financing of replacement facilities would not be material to the company s cash flows and costs related to relocation would not be significant to income 
the facility located near hershey  pennsylvania was constructed on land owned by the company 
the company entered into a ground lease with the lessor  an spt 
the initial term of the ground lease extends to the date that is the later of i the date the facility lease is no longer in effect  or ii the date when the company satisfies the residual guarantee associated with the lease 
an additional term for the ground lease begins upon the end of the initial ground lease term and ends upon the later of the date all sums required to be paid under the lease agreement are paid in full and the th anniversary of the ground lease commencement date 
if the company chooses not to renew the building lease or purchase the building  it must re market the building on the lessor s behalf subject to the ground lease  which will continue in force until the earlier of the date all sums required to be paid under the lease agreement are paid in full and the th anniversary of the ground lease inception date 
the lease of the warehouse and distribution facility does not include any provisions which would require the company to sell the land to the spt 
the company s provision for income taxes  accrued income taxes and deferred income taxes are based upon income  statutory tax rates  the legal structure of the company and interpretation of tax laws 
as a matter of course  the company is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in assessments of additional tax 
the company maintains reserves for such assessments 
the reserves are determined based upon the company s judgment of assessment risk and are adjusted  from time to time  based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established 
a settlement of federal tax audits for the and tax years  as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues were concluded during the second quarter of based upon the results of the audits  the income tax contingency reserves were adjusted resulting in a reduction of income tax reserves by million  reflecting a reduction of the provision for income taxes by million and a reduction to goodwill of million 
the income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility and timing of certain expenses  interest on potential assessments  and acquisition and divestiture matters 
assessments of additional tax require use of the company s cash 
the company is not aware of any significant income tax assessments 
accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments the company utilizes certain derivative instruments  from time to time  including interest rate swaps  foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options  and commodities futures contracts  to manage interest rate  currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures 
interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts and options are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
commodities futures contracts are entered into for varying periods and are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases  energy requirements and transportation costs 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 
in entering into these contracts  the company has assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
the company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults 
the company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 
 as amended 
sfas no 
 as amended  provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the transaction affects earnings 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument  if any  must be recognized currently in earnings 
for a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment referred to as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss must be recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 
all derivative instruments currently utilized by the company  including variable to fixed interest rate swaps  foreign exchange contracts and options and commodities futures contracts  are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the company adopted sfas no 
 as amended  as of january  additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the information below summarizes the company s market risks associated with long term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december  this information should be read in conjunction with note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
long term debt the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long term debt  including the current portion  as of december  the fair value of long term debt was determined based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 
maturity date in thousands of dollars except for rates thereafter total fair value long term debt interest rate interest rates on variable rate obligations were calculated using the rate in effect as of december  interest rates on certain long term debt have been converted from variable to fixed rates as discussed under the heading interest rate swaps below 
interest rate swaps in order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure  the company  from time to time  enters into interest rate swap agreements 
in october  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert interest payments on long term debt from fixed to variable rates 
interest payments on million of notes due in october and million of notes due in march were converted from the respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate  libor 
in march  the company terminated these agreements  resulting in cash receipts totaling million  with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the long term debt 
this increase is being amortized over the remaining term of the respective long term debt as a reduction to interest expense 
in february  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted variable interest rate payments on certain leases from a variable to a fixed rate of 
the fair value of interest rate swaps is defined as the difference in the present values of cash flows calculated at the contracted interest rates and at current market interest rates at the end of the period 
the fair value of the swap agreements is calculated quarterly based upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial instruments 
the fair value of the variable to fixed interest rate swaps was a liability of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the potential net loss in fair value of interest rate swaps of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near term adverse change in market rates was 
million and 
million as of december  and  respectively 
the company s risk related to the interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the agreements at prevailing market rates 
foreign exchange forward contracts and options the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase or forecasted purchases of equipment  certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with its subsidiaries outside the united states 
these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements 
foreign currency price risks are hedged generally for periods from to months 
foreign exchange forward contracts and options are intended to be and are effective as hedges of identifiable  foreign currency commitments 
foreign exchange forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedging derivatives and the fair value of such contracts is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability 
gains and losses on these contracts are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
as of december   the company had foreign exchange forward contracts and options maturing primarily in and to purchase million in foreign currency  primarily australian dollars  canadian dollars and euros  and to sell million in foreign currency  primarily mexican pesos and japanese yen  at contracted forward rates 
as of december   the company had foreign exchange forward contracts and options maturing primarily in and to purchase million in foreign currency  primarily canadian dollars  and to sell million in foreign currency  primarily japanese yen  at contracted forward rates 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and options is defined as the amount of the difference between contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of the period 
on a quarterly basis  the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options is estimated by obtaining market quotes for future contracts with similar terms  adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 
the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options was an asset of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the potential net loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near term adverse change in market rates was 
million and 
million as of december  and  respectively 
the company s risk related to the foreign exchange contracts and options is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
commodity price risk management the company s most significant raw material requirements include cocoa  sugar  milk  peanuts and almonds 
the company attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of these raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements  generally for periods from to months 
with regard to cocoa  sugar  corn sweeteners  natural gas  fuel oil and certain dairy products  price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts 
at the present time  active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the company s other major raw material requirements 
futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa  sugar  corn sweetener  natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations that provide more favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw material and energy requirements 
fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the company s transportation costs 
the company s commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases  but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases 
the cost of cocoa beans and the prices for the related commodity futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors  including the effect of weather on crop yield  other imbalances between supply and demand  currency exchange rates  political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences 
after declining from an eighteen year high in february  cocoa continued to trade at relatively high price levels during continued civil unrest in the world s largest cocoa producing country  the ivory coast  resulted in volatile market conditions  but has not materially affected the harvesting and marketing of the cocoa crop 
the company s costs during and beyond will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices  premiums and discounts reflective of relative values  varying delivery times  and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans 
the company s costs for cocoa will increase in  however  the company expects to achieve its long term goals for growth and profitability by a combination of selling price increases  supply chain cost reductions and strict control of other costs to offset cost increases and respond to changes in the competitive environment 
commodities futures contracts in connection with the purchasing of cocoa  sugar  corn sweeteners  natural gas  fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs  the company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations 
exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical forward purchase contracts 
cash transfers reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts unrealized gains and losses are made on a daily basis 
the company accounts for commodities futures contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended  and accordingly  cash transfers are reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
such cash transfers will be offset by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw materials  energy requirements and transportation costs in the future 
futures being held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 
the following sensitivity analysis reflects the market risk of the company to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent  based on the company s net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year 
the company s net commodity positions consist of the excess of futures contracts held over unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities  relating to cocoa  sugar  corn sweeteners  natural gas  fuel oil and certain dairy products 
inventories  priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet contracted for were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations 
a loss is defined  for purposes of determining market risk  as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement 
the fair values of net commodity positions were based upon quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 
for the years ended december  in millions of dollars fair value market risk hypothetical change fair value market risk hypothetical change highest long position lowest long position average position long the increase in fair values from to primarily reflected an increase in commodity prices during the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures being held at certain points in time during the years 
sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forward looking statements  which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected 
the important factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield  other imbalances between supply and demand  currency exchange rates  political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences in addition to changes in the company s hedging strategies 
use of estimates and other critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
significant accounting policies employed by the company  including the use of estimates  are presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates involved in applying the company s accounting policies are those that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and those for which different estimates reasonably could have been used for the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  and would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the company s most critical accounting estimates  discussed below  pertain to accounting policies for accounts receivable trade  accrued liabilities and pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
accounts receivable trade in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to customers that satisfy pre defined credit criteria 
the company believes that it has little concentration of credit risk due to the diversity of its customer base 
accounts receivable trade  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  were net of allowances and anticipated discounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectibility based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
the company monitors the collectibility of its accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable  assessing the credit worthiness of its customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks 
estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future 
over the three year period ended december   the company recorded expense averaging approximately million per year for potential uncollectible accounts  including a million provision in related to the estimate of probable exposure to the bankruptcy of one of the company s customers  fleming companies  inc this provision was reversed in the fourth quarter of upon the agreement with fleming reclamation creditor s trust which resolved most significant matters related to the bankruptcy 
write offs of uncollectible accounts  net of recoveries  averaged approximately million over the same period 
the provision for uncollectible accounts is recognized as selling  marketing and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 
over the past three years  the allowance for doubtful accounts has ranged from to of gross accounts receivable 
if reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions were made with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable  the amounts by which the annual provision would have changed would have resulted in a reduction in expense of approximately million to an increase in expense of approximately million 
changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on the company s liquidity or capital resources 
accrued liabilities accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 
the company utilizes numerous trade promotion programs 
the costs of such programs are recognized as a reduction to net sales with the recording of a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of product shipment 
the accrued liability for marketing promotions is determined through analysis of programs offered  historical trends  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation  sales and payment trends  and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that had been previously offered 
the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future as a result of changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation  particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products 
promotional costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs would have resulted in changes ranging from a reduction in such costs of approximately million to an increase in costs of approximately million  with an increase or decrease to net sales and income before income taxes within that range 
over the last three years  actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 
changes in estimates related to the cost of promotion programs would not have a material impact on the company s liquidity or capital resources 
at the time of sale  the company estimates a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future 
the estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales 
a related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends  seasonal timing and sales patterns  and product movement at retail 
estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  changes in consumer demand  the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotion programs 
over the three year period ended december   costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately of gross sales 
reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from 
million to million 
in each of the years in the three year period ended december   actual costs have not deviated from the company s estimates by more than 
reasonably possible near term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on the company s liquidity or capital resources 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans 
the principal plans are the hershey foods corporation retirement plan and the hershey foods corporation retirement plan for hourly employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees 
the company is monitoring legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans  as well as recent court cases  for any impact on its plans 
the company also sponsors two primary post retirement benefit plans 
the health care plan is contributory  with participants contributions adjusted annually  and the life insurance plan is non contributory 
the company s policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of and federal income tax laws  respectively 
non domestic pension liabilities are funded in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations 
plan assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities 
short term and long term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations 
these calculations are made considering payroll and employee data  including age and years of service  along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements 
the company takes into consideration long term projections with regard to economic conditions  including interest rates  return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
with regard to liabilities associated with other post retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance  the company takes into consideration the long term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits 
in compliance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  the discount rate assumption is reviewed and may be revised annually 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption asset return assumption for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and would be revised only when long term asset return projections demonstrate that need 
pension plans the net periodic pension benefits cost for the company sponsored plans was million  million and million  respectively  in  and for  net periodic pension benefits cost is expected to be comparable to primarily due to a higher than expected return on plan assets during and cash contributions to the pension plans in  offset by the lower discount rate 
the recognized net actuarial losses will be higher in due to the lower discount rate 
actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when the actuarial assumptions used to value the plan s obligations are revised from time to time 
the company s policy is to amortize only unrecognized net actuarial gains losses in excess of of the respective plan s projected benefit obligation  or fair market value of assets  if greater 
the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefits cost for is million based on the december  unrecognized net actuarial loss presented in note  pension and other post retirement benefit plans  of million and an amortization period of primarily between thirteen and fifteen years  the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans average remaining service period 
changes to the assumed rates of participant termination  disability and retirement would impact the average remaining service period 
an increase in these rates would decrease the average remaining service period and a decrease in these rates would have the opposite effect 
however  changes to these assumed rates are not anticipated at this time 
the recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefits cost was million 
projections beyond are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 
the company used an average discount rate assumption of  and for  and  respectively  in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for its plans 
the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefits cost by million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefits cost by million 
the company s discount rate represents the estimated rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
in order to estimate this rate  the company considers the yields of high quality securities  which are generally considered to be those receiving a rating no lower than the second highest given by a recognized rating agency 
the company reduced its average discount rate assumption to for valuing obligations as of december   from as of december   due to the declining interest rate environment 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december  pension benefits obligations by million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  pension benefits obligations by million 
asset return assumptions of  and were used in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for  and  respectively  and the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefits cost was based on the fair market value of pension plan assets 
to determine the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets 
the historical geometric average return over the years prior to december  was approximately 
the actual return on assets was during  with gains during of approximately and losses during of 
the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost 
a one percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefits cost by million and a one percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefits cost by million 
the company s pension asset investment policies specify ranges of pension asset allocation percentages for each asset class 
the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows equity securities   debt securities   and cash  
as of december   the actual allocations were within the ranges 
the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns is expected to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes disclosed 
for and  the company had no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the non domestic plans were not material 
however  the company made contributions of million in and million in to improve the funded status 
these contributions were fully tax deductible 
a one percentage point change in the discount rate or asset return assumptions would not have changed the minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans 
for  there will be no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the non domestic plans will not be material 
however  the company contributed million to the domestic plans in january to improve the funded status 
post retirement benefit plans other post retirement benefits costs relate primarily to health care and life insurance benefits 
net periodic other post retirement benefits costs for the company sponsored plans were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for the calculation of net periodic other post retirement benefits costs  discount rate assumptions of  and were used for  and  respectively 
the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly impact net periodic other post retirement benefits costs 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic other post retirement benefits costs by million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic other post retirement benefits costs by million 
the company used discount rate assumptions of and to value the other post retirement benefits obligations as of december  and  respectively 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december  other post retirement benefits obligations by million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  other post retirement benefits obligations by million 
on december   the president of the united states signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the medicare act 
the medicare act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the company believes that certain prescription drug benefits offered under post retirement health care plans will qualify for the subsidy under medicare part d 
the federal subsidy to be provided by the medicare act reduced net periodic benefits costs in by approximately million and lowered the accumulated post retirement benefits obligation by approximately million 
other critical accounting policies employed by the company include the following goodwill and other intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
other intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks  customer related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions 
the useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and  therefore  these assets are not being amortized

patents are being amortized over their remaining legal lives of approximately sixteen years 
the impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is performed by using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the evaluation of the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives is conducted annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets with indefinite lives  then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
goodwill was assigned to reporting units and transitional impairment tests were performed for goodwill and other intangible assets during the first quarter of and the annual impairment tests were performed in the fourth quarters of  and no impairment of assets was determined as a result of these tests
