executive overview the company s operations cpi corp 
is a long standing leader  based on sittings and related revenues  in the professional portrait photography of young children and families 
from the single studio opened by its predecessor company in  we have grown to  studios throughout the united states  canada and puerto rico principally under license agreements with sears 
we have provided professional portrait photography for sears customers since and have been the only sears portrait studio operator since as of the end of the last three fiscal years  the company s studio counts were united states and puerto rico within full line sears stores locations not within sears stores canada total    during  the company converted of its us studios to a full digital format 
these locations marked the beginning of a plan to transition a substantial share of our studios to full digital technology in competitive factors trends challenges as previously discussed  the mass market professional studio industry is facing challenging and difficult industry conditions 
these include relatively stagnant growth  industry sitting declines  heavy promotional activity  the proliferation of wal mart studios with convenient locations and aggressively priced portrait package offers  the emergence of competitors notably picture people with perceived differentiation and offering immediate fulfillment of portrait orders  and the rapid evolution of both amateur and professional digital technology 
the competitive and other external factors cited above  coupled with the likely less than optimal experience that certain of our customers have experienced over the past several years due to technology and support challenges caused in part by an aging studio infrastructure and certain other operational issues  have resulted in a declining sittings trend in our sears portrait studios 
our sittings volumes declined by nearly from to although a portion of the sittings decline has been offset by increases in our average customer sales  overall net sales over the same time period have declined from million in to million in on march   the knightspoint group successfully completed their consent solicitation resulting in  among other things  the replacement of all but two of the company s then existing directors with the slate proposed by the knightspoint group 
shortly thereafter  the company s new board conducted a comprehensive review of the company s operations and competitive position and formulated a range of new operating initiatives for the company 
as a result of that review  the company has taken the following actions  among others  in an effort to improve operations  increase customer satisfaction and retention and reverse the declining trend in sales exited the mexican and mobile photography businesses that were draining scarce managerial and financial resources from the core sears portrait studio business 
terminated a major internal software development project intended to be the foundation for the company s ultimate transition to a digital format and instead pursued outsourcing options with third party vendors 
upgraded computer hardware in all us studios  improving the performance of legacy dos based systems while preparing the way for a transition to digital 
restored coverage  training and retention hours in the studios that had been reduced in in response to declining sales 
raised prices and tapped more efficient advertising vehicles 
introduced several new products that contributed approximately million in busy season sales 
converted of our us studios to full digital format prior to the busy season 
we believe the foregoing initiatives have already begun to show tangible benefits 
late in the third quarter of  we experienced a partial reversal in the negative sales trend we experienced in the first half of the year and which had continued into the early part of the third quarter 
in the fourth quarter  on a comparable week basis  the positive sales trend continued 
our plan of action for is to convert most of our portrait studios to a full digital format 
leverage digital technology to provide customers greater variety in posing and effects  speedier including same day fulfillment of portrait orders  a range of new product and service options  and an improved overall experience 
transform our overall marketing strategy to expand our target market and focus our message offers on quality  service and value rather than price 
implement various field initiatives to drive improvement in quality  service  productivity and customer retention 
results of operations a summary of consolidated results of operations and key statistics follows thousands  except share and per share data net sales    cost and expenses cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below cost of sales as a percentage of net sales gross margin as a percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses   selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales depreciation and amortization    other charges and impairments    loss income from continuing operations    interest expense    interest income    impairment and related obligations of preferred security interest  other income  net loss earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense income tax benefit expense    net loss earnings from continuing operations   net loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefit of   and  respectively    net loss earnings    net loss earnings per share diluted net sales totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net sales in declined million  or to million compared to the million reported in this decline in sales is attributable to a continued decline in customer sittings and the absence of the additional week of sales that was reported in  a week fiscal year  both partially offset by an increase in the average sales per customer sitting 
average sales per customer sitting in increased approximately while customer sittings declined both compared to the fiscal year 
the company experienced a nearly sales decline during the first half of based on both sittings and average sale declines 
through the first half of  the average sale per customer sitting was down compared to the first half of due largely to increased discounting of offers in response to competitive pressures 
the negative first half average sales trend was totally reversed in the third quarter of when for that quarter the company reported average sales per customer sitting increased compared to the comparable quarter in as a result  the company s negative sales trend moderated to just over a decline 
during the fourth quarter of  the company benefited from an approximate increase in its average sale per customer sitting 
the company believes that the reversal in the negative sales trends experienced since late is largely attributable to the impact of the following initiatives undertaken throughout the year and continuing 
the implementation of a significant computer hardware and printer upgrade in all of our us studios which improved the performance of our legacy systems while laying the foundation for a transition to digital 
the successful conversion of of our studios to full digital format prior to the start of the fourth quarter busy season 
these studios significantly outperformed the analog film studios in the fourth quarter and continue to do so to date 
the restoration of coverage and training hours to our studios that had been significantly reduced in the fiscal fourth quarter in response to then declining sales trends 
the effectuation of offer changes and targeted price increases as well as the increased utilization of more efficient advertising vehicles 
the introduction of new products contributing in excess of million in fourth quarter sales 
net sales in were million  representing a decrease from the million reported in  despite the benefit received from the rd week 
the rd week favorably impacted net sales in by approximately million 
the decline in revenues was primarily due to a reduced number of sittings within the sears portrait studios partially offset by an increase in the average sales per customer sitting 
in  sittings were down from the sittings generated in the average sale per customer in was higher than the average realized in the decrease in sittings between and was attributable to a number of external as well as internal factors 
among the external factors are the impacts of continuing competitive pressures  including the opening of new competitor locations and severe competitor discounting  especially at the beginning of the holiday season 
in addition  the overall decline was exacerbated by the negative impacts of the inclement weather experienced in february and march in a large portion of the country 
finally  the rate at which customers continue to adopt amateur digital photography technologies has accelerated which may be impacting the frequency of studio visits 
internal factors potentially negatively impacting sittings include the company s decision to substantially reduce television advertising and studio employment costs in the second half and fourth quarter of in response to weaker than anticipated sales performance during the first three quarters of in addition  it is likely that some customers visiting our studios are receiving a less than optimal experience as a result of ongoing technology and support challenges caused by our aging studio infrastructure 
the increase in average sales per customer between and was primarily attributable to a continued mix shift toward the higher value custom sittings as the decline in package sittings accounted for a substantial portion of the reported decline in overall sittings  an increase in the percentage of sales related to the march rollout of digitally enhanced products and the company s decision late in the second quarter of to begin selling custom proof sheets which had previously been provided free of charge as part of the custom offer 
costs and expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in cost of sales  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in and in correspondingly  gross margin rates were in  in and in the decrease in cost of sales from to is primarily the result of reduced levels of sittings and productivity improvements generated from improved manufacturing processes surrounding the second year of production of digitally enhanced products 
the decreases were partially offset by markdowns on merchandise sales of frames and accessories in an effort to clear older inventory  higher effective media costs associated both with new digital studios as well as inefficiencies related to start up operations of new digital printers in the analog studios and the reversal in the third quarter of of a previously accrued liability more fully discussed in the following paragraph 
the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  from to was primarily a result of reduced sitting levels as well as increased costs associated with producing and shipping the new digitally enhanced product introduced in referred to as portrait creations 
while not substantially impacting the overall cost of sales as a percentage of sales  cost of sales were positively impacted in the third quarter by the reversal of a previously accrued liability amounting to approximately  related to minimum usage requirements under a supply contract 
this reversal related to the favorable renegotiation of the company s supply contract with a vendor 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  cost of sales increased by approximately million  despite a substantial decline in sittings  resulting principally from manufacturing inefficiencies in the company s st 
louis production facility 
these inefficiencies related to integrating production previously handled by the company s las vegas production facility which was closed after the fiscal holiday season and production issues pertaining to the first busy season of producing both film and new digitally enhanced products discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses were in  in and in the million decrease in selling  general and administrative costs is principally the result of million in planned net reductions in advertising costs  lower corporate employment costs of million  and million of net decreases in various other categories of expenses such as travel and meetings  studio supplies  and postage and freight 
these decreases were partially offset by net increases in studio employment costs of  related to the broad restoration of coverage and training hours as well as the startup operation of digital studios  costs and inefficiencies associated both the company s digital conversion efforts as well as with the implementation of the system wide studio hardware upgrade project  increases of million in health insurance costs and approximately  in costs related to professional services incurred in conjunction with the first year of required internal control reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the decline in advertising expenses resulted from a comprehensive evaluation of the productivity of the various vehicles utilized  the result of which was the elimination of high cost  low productivity vehicles and reinvestment in more cost effective vehicles that are anticipated to also be more productive and targeted 
the decline in corporate employment costs resulted from the executive and other corporate staff reductions that took place principally in the first and second quarters of the net decreases in the various other categories mentioned above resulted from the company s ongoing cost reduction initiatives 
the increase in studio employment costs resulted from a strategic decision to restore coverage  training and retention hours in the studio  especially in the second half of that had been substantially reduced in the second half of in response to the declining sales environment 
the million decrease in from was primarily the result of million in savings from reduced advertising expense and a million decrease in commissions due to lower sales volumes 
in addition  during the third and fourth quarters of  reductions in studio employment costs of million substantially offset comparable increases in such amounts in the first two quarters of the reductions in the third and fourth quarters of were the result of the company s response to bring studio employment costs as a percentage of sales back into line with the lower level of sales than originally planned 
these savings more than offset increases compared to the prior year in studio supplies and telephone expense  travel and meeting costs and pension expense of million  million and million  respectively 
depreciation and amortization was million in  compared to million in and million in the slight net decrease in depreciation expense between and resulted from certain assets becoming fully depreciated in  partially offset by increased depreciation charges related to increased levels of capital spending in and continuing in the decrease in depreciation expense between and was primarily the result of photographic equipment placed in to service in and becoming fully depreciated in other charges and impairments reflect costs incurred from strategic actions implemented by the company to restructure its operations  costs that are unpredictable and atypical of the company s operations and additional charges due to asset impairments

in the case of both the digital camera project and the digital manufacturing system  the company has made the decision to prospectively utilize commercially available cameras and digital manufacturing software

the income tax benefit on losses from continuing operations totaled million in the provision for income taxes from continuing operations in and totaled million and million  respectively 
these benefits provisions resulted in effective tax rates of in  in and in the difference in the effective income tax rate resulted in a lower income tax benefit due to the recording of the valuation allowance on the company s foreign tax credit and capital loss carry forwards  the tax effects of the company s foreign operations and the realignment of the company s officer life insurance program

net losses from discontinued operations were million in  million in and million in these discontinued operations relate to the company s previously existing mexican and mobile photography operations and technology development segment and are further discussed below 
during the second quarter of  the company s recently reconstituted board of directors made a strategic decision to exit both the mexican and mobile photography operations which began operations in this decision was made to allow the company to enhance focus on the core sears portrait studios business as well as to eliminate the ongoing operating dilution associated with these businesses

the severance accruals consist principally of potential benefits related to severance pay and related costs and supplemental retirement plan costs associated with the dismissal of certain executives 
the guaranteed bonuses relate to those bonuses provided for in employment contracts for those covered executives whose employment continues with the company 
certain of these severance amounts are being contested by the company 
notwithstanding the potential reduction of certain of these amounts through settlement negotiations and litigation  such amounts are recorded at the contractual amounts due 
the table does not include our deferred income tax liability  accruals for self insured losses and pension benefits because it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
we did not make any contributions to our pension plan in and do not expect to do so in future contributions to our pension plan will be dependent upon recently passed legislation  future changes in discount rates and the earnings performance of our plan assets 
as indicated in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  the projected benefit obligation of the company s pension plan exceeded plan assets by million at the end of and million at the end of this million increase in the underfunded status between and resulted from a million growth in the projected benefit obligation from million to million being only partially offset by a growth in the fair value of plan assets of  the projected benefit obligation grew as a result of annual costs associated with service costs  interest costs and actuarial losses all determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
all three of these cost components actually decreased in from partially as a result of the company s decision in early to freeze benefits under the plan

the letters of credit generally having a one year maturity and are renewed annually 
in july  the company announced the completion of the sale of its wall d cor segment which included the ongoing guarantee of certain operating real estate leases of prints plus 
as of february   the maximum future obligation to the company under its guarantee of these leases is million 
to recognize the risk associated with these leases and based upon the company s past experience with renegotiating lease obligations  a million reserve was established in at time of the sale 
as a result of the significant deterioration in the financial performance of prints plus in the third quarter of  including its subsequent bankruptcy filing  all of which is more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company recorded an additional million of lease obligation reserves brining the total reserve at february  to million 
based on the progress of the bankruptcy cases to date  the company believes that the million reserve is adequate to cover the potential losses to be realized under the company s operating lease guarantees

application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the company to estimate the effect of various matters that are inherently uncertain as of the date of the financial statements 
each of these required estimates varies in regard to the level of judgment involved and its potential impact on the company s reported financial results 
estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  and would materially impact the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  critical estimates inherent in these accounting policies are discussed in the following paragraphs 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  general liability  business auto usage and employee medical claims 
the company has stop loss coverages to limit the exposure arising from these claims 
self insurance losses for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and the company s historical experience 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
income taxes the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws 
the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by the company are based on management s interpretation of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions 
income tax expense also reflects the company s best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income  interpretation of the tax laws  and tax planning 
the company assesses temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are shown on our consolidated balance sheet 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized
