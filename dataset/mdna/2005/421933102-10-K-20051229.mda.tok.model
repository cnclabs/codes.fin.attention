critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we consider the following critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make the most significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements 
net patient service revenue we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the medicare and medicaid programs and from managed care health plans 
payments for services we render to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
for medicare and medicaid revenue  provisions for contractual adjustments are made to reduce the charges to these patients to estimated cash receipts based upon the programs principles of payment reimbursement ie  either prospectively determined or retrospectively determined costs 
final settlements under these programs are subject to administrative review and audit and  accordingly  we periodically provide reserves for the adjustments that may ultimately result therefrom 
estimates for contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based primarily on the payment terms of contractual arrangements  such as predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates or discounted fee for service rates 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms  to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
in the ordinary course of business  we provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for their care 
accounts written off as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net patient service revenue 
the policy and practice at each of our hospitals is to write off a patient s entire account balance upon determining that the patient qualifies under a hospital s charity care and or indigent policy 
we continually monitor the levels of charity and indigent care and the procedures employed by our hospitals to identify and account for these patients 
we believe that our policies result in the appropriate recognition of net patient service revenue 
provision for doubtful accounts our hospitals provide services to patients with health care coverage  as well as to those without health care coverage 
those patients with health care coverage are often responsible for a portion of their bill referred to as the co payment or deductible 
this portion is determined by the patient s specific health care or insurance plan 
patients without health care coverage are evaluated at the time of service  or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based on federal and state poverty guidelines  qualification for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as the local hospital s policies for indigent and charity care 
after payment  if any  is received from a third party  statements are sent to individual patients indicating the outstanding balance on their account 
if the account is still outstanding after a period of time  it is referred to a primary collection agency for assistance in collecting the amount due 
the primary collection agency begins the process of debt collection by contacting the patient via mail and phone 
the purpose of this process is to work with the patient to resolve the outstanding debt 
the primary collection agency acts  in most cases  as an extension of our local hospital business office 
the accounts that are sent to these agencies are often difficult to collect and require more focused  dedicated attention than might be available in the local hospital business office 
we believe that the primary collection agencies have proven very successful in collecting the accounts that we send to them 
a secondary collection agency is utilized when accounts are returned from the primary collection agency as uncollectible 
these accounts are written off at that point as uncollectible 
an account is typically sent to the primary collection agency automatically via electronic transfer of data at the end of the statement cycle although  if deemed necessary or appropriate  the account can be sent to the primary collection agency at any time 
in many cases  patients who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent write offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their account balance 
all commercial accounts over days old from date of discharge are reserved in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
as discussed below  the policy for fully reserving against self pay accounts changed during the year ended september  from days to days after the date of discharge 
for governmental accounts  an allowance for doubtful accounts is established for accounts over days old from date of discharge 
the accounts that are reserved include those placed with a collection agency and those for which legal action has been taken 
the accounts for which legal action has been taken are written off once a judgment is obtained 
commercial and self pay accounts under days and days old  respectively  from the date of discharge that are placed with a primary collection agency are not reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts due to the fact that  in most cases  we consider the primary collection agencies extensions of our local hospital business offices and we do not believe that a reserve is necessary until the primary collector has appropriately evaluated the account and deemed it uncollectible 
accounts are reviewed individually and  accordingly  they are not automatically written off when they reach the aforementioned reserve thresholds 
accounts that are identified as self pay accounts with balances less than are automatically written off on the th day of each month 
all accounts that have been placed with a primary collection agency that are less than are also written off 
as discussed in note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  we modified our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policy for self pay accounts during the year ended september  in order to reserve all those accounts at days previously we reserved such accounts at days 
this accounting policy modification was based on our current collection rates and reflects increases in underinsured and uninsured patient service volume that have been experienced by us and the hospital industry as a whole 
although we believe that this new policy is appropriate and responsive to the current health care environment and the overall economic climate  we will continue to monitor these circumstances and related industry trends 
changes in payor mix  business office operations  general economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could adversely affect our accounts receivable collections  cash flows and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the determination of possible impairment for assets to be held and used is predicated on our estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
long lived assets to be disposed of  including discontinued operations  are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
there were no long lived asset impairment charges that were material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations during the three years ended september  goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
however  goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever circumstances indicate that a possible impairment might exist 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on  among other things  market conditions and operational performance 
when performing the impairment test  we initially compare the fair values of our reporting units net assets to the corresponding carrying amounts thereof on the consolidated balance sheet 
if the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets is less than the balance sheet carrying amount  we determine the implied fair value of goodwill  compare such fair value to the reporting unit s goodwill carrying amount and  if necessary  record a goodwill impairment charge 
however  there were no goodwill impairment charges during the three years ended september  changes in the estimates used to conduct impairment tests  including revenue and profitability projections and market values  could indicate that our goodwill is impaired in future periods and result in a write off of some or all of the goodwill at that time 
reporting units are one level below the operating segment level see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 
therefore  after consideration of sfas no 
s aggregation rules  our goodwill impairment testing is performed at a divisional operating level 
goodwill is discretely allocated to our reporting units ie  each hospital s stand alone goodwill is included as a component of the aggregate reporting unit goodwill being evaluated during the impairment analysis 
income taxes we make estimates to record the provision for income taxes  including conclusions regarding deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  as well as valuation allowances that might be required to offset deferred tax assets 
we estimate valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
when establishing valuation allowances  we consider all relevant information  including ongoing tax planning strategies 
we believe that  other than certain state net operating loss carryforwards  future taxable income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets and  therefore  we have not recorded any significant valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
we operate in multiple states with varying tax laws 
we are subject to both federal and state audits of our tax filings 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through fiscal year and resulted in no material audit adjustments 
our federal income tax returns for fiscal years and are currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
we make estimates in order to record tax reserves that adequately provide for audit adjustments  if any 
professional liability claims commencing october   we began utilizing our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary in the cayman islands in order to self insure a greater portion of our primary professional and general liability risk 
since its inception  the captive insurance subsidiary has provided claims made coverage to all of our hospitals and substantially all of our employed physicians 
during the years ended september  and  we also procured claims made policies with independent commercial carriers in order to provide coverage for losses and loss expenses beyond the captive insurance company s policy limits 
during the year ended september   the captive insurance company provided significantly enhanced coverage to us and  in connection therewith  it obtained claims made reinsurance policies for professional liability risks above certain retention levels 
the total cost of our professional liability program was approximately  and of total revenue during the years ended september   and  respectively 
we determine our reserves for self insured professional liability risks using asserted and unasserted claim data that has been accumulated by our incident reporting system  as well as independent third party actuarial analyses that are predicated on our historical loss payment patterns and industry trends 
we have discounted these long term liabilities to their estimated present value using discount rates of and at september  and  respectively 
we select a discount rate by estimating a risk free interest rate that corresponds to the period when the claims are projected to be paid 
the discounted reserves are periodically reviewed and adjustments thereto are recorded as more information about claim trends becomes known to us and our actuary 
although the ultimate settlement of these liabilities may vary from our estimates  we believe that the amounts provided in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable and adequate 
however  if the actual claim payments and expenses exceed our projected estimates  our reserves could be materially adversely affected 
other self insured programs we provide income continuance and certain reimbursable health costs collectively workers compensation to our disabled employees and we provide health and welfare benefits to our employees  their spouses and certain beneficiaries 
such employee benefit programs are primarily self insured 
at the end of each reporting period  we record estimated liabilities for both reported and incurred but not reported workers compensation and health and welfare claims based upon historical loss experience  independent actuarial determinations and other information provided by our third party administrators 
liabilities for the workers compensation program are discounted to their estimated present value using a discount rate selected by us that represents an estimated risk free interest rate corresponding to the period when such benefits are projected to be paid 
we believe that the estimated liabilities for these self insured programs are adequate and reasonable but there can be no assurances that the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates 
if the costs of these programs exceed our estimates  the liabilities could be materially adversely affected 
recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation on december   the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r also supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  sfas no 
r is similar to sfas no 
 however  sfas no 
r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
moreover  pro forma disclosure of the impact of stock based compensation is no longer permitted as an alternative 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective methodologies 
we elected to adopt sfas no 
r s modified prospective methodology on october  we previously accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
and  as such  no compensation cost for employee stock options has been recognized through september  therefore  the adoption of the fair value method under sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the precise impact that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on us cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the amount and nature of share based awards granted by us in the future 
had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of such accounting pronouncement would have approximated that which is described in the sfas no 
pro forma table at note r to the consolidated financial statements in item sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow item rather than as an operating cash flow item  as provided under superseded accounting standards 
while we cannot estimate future amounts because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise their stock options  the amount of operating cash flows during the year ended september  for such excess tax deductions under an sfas no 
r model approach was approximately million 
on november   the fasb issued staff position no 
r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  which provides an alternative and simplified method to calculate the pool of excess income tax benefits upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
among other things  staff position no 
r also provides guidance on how to present excess tax benefits in statements of cash flows when the alternative pool calculation is used 
the fasb s new guidance became effective upon its issuance  however  companies can generally make a one time election to adopt the transition method in staff position r up to one year from the later of a initial adoption of sfas r or b november  if a company elects to adopt the alternative method after it has already issued financial statements pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
r  such adoption would be considered a change in accounting principle 
we have not yet fully evaluated this new accounting guidance and  accordingly  we have not determined whether we will elect the alternative method thereunder 
physician guarantees and commitments in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
fin elaborated on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such guarantee 
our adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
on november   fasb staff position fin  application of fasb interpretation no 
to minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owners  fin was issued 
fin requires that a guarantor apply the recognition  measurement and disclosure provisions of fin to guarantees granted to a business or its owners that the revenue of the business or a specific portion of the business for a specified period of time will be at least a specified minimum amount ie  a minimum revenue guarantee 
because the examples cited in fin are similar to certain of our physician recruitment and physician group professional services arrangements  we believe that they will fall under the purview of fin  however  we have not yet quantified the impact that fin s adoption will have on our consolidated financial position and our results of operations 
this new accounting guidance applies to all new minimum revenue guarantees issued or modified on or after the beginning of the first quarter following november  retroactive application of fin is not permitted 
results of operations overview at september   we operated acute care hospitals and two psychiatric hospitals in non urban communities in alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  kentucky  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  virginia  washington and west virginia 
unless specifically indicated otherwise  the following discussion is exclusive of williamson memorial hospital in williamson  west virginia 
the operations of such hospital during each of the years in the three year period ended september  were not material to our consolidated results of operations 
see note  discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements in item during the year ended september   which we refer to as the period  we reported net patient service revenue growth over the year ended september   which we refer to as the period  of 
in addition  consolidated net income and net income per diluted share increased by and  respectively  during the period as compared to the period 
enhanced period net patient service revenue resulted from increases in hospital admissions  surgeries and reimbursement rates  as well as the inclusion of revenue from hospitals acquired by us since october  the period was adversely impacted by a modification in our reserve policy for self pay accounts receivable  which resulted in an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements in item our same hospital surgeries increased in the period when compared to the period due  in part  to surgeries performed at our hospitals by newly recruited physicians 
additionally  same hospital admissions increased slightly in the period compared to the period 
we believe that these increases are due  in part  to our adherence to the acquisition criteria we have strictly followed for many years  whereby we acquire hospitals in growing non urban areas and in areas where we believe the opportunity to reverse outmigration to other hospitals exists 
furthermore  our hospitals continue to add physicians to their medical staffs and medical equipment to their hospitals in order to meet the needs of the communities they serve 
we believe that  over time  these investments  coupled with improved demographics  have resulted in  and will continue to result in  increases to hospital surgeries and admissions 
outpatient services continue to play an important role in the delivery of health care in our markets  with approximately half of our net patient service revenue during the period and the period generated on an outpatient basis 
we continue to focus on emergency room services and diagnostic imaging services to meet the needs of the communities we serve and have invested capital in nearly every one of our hospitals over the last five years in one of these two areas 
reflective of this continuous focus  our same hospital adjusted admissions  which adjusts admissions for outpatient volume  increased in the period compared to the period 
our provision for doubtful accounts during the period increased basis points to of net patient service revenue compared to of net patient service revenue in the period 
substantially all of the period increase is attributable to the modification of our self pay accounts receivable reserve policy described above excluding the impact of such modification  the period provision for doubtful accounts rate was nominally below the corresponding period rate 
we believe that  on a recurring basis  our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net patient service revenue is generally lower than our industry peer group average because our longstanding and consistently applied charity care and indigent policies result in a higher percentage of uninsured patients accounts being treated as foregone unrecognized revenue 
economic conditions and changes in commercial health insurance benefit plans over the past several years have contributed to an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients seeking health care in the united states 
this general industry trend has also affected us  with our same hospital self pay admissions increasing in the period compared to the period 
we continually evaluate our policies and programs in light of these and other trends and consider changes or modifications to our policies as circumstances warrant 
in late august  hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast of louisiana  mississippi and alabama and caused substantial damage to residential and commercial properties in mississippi  where we operate a number of hospitals 
the property damage caused by hurricane katrina at our hospitals was relatively minor and  therefore  did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations 
however  we cannot predict the extent that the damage caused by hurricane katrina will affect our patients  payors and vendors or the local economies in the effected areas 
period compared to the period the following tables summarize our results of operations for the period and the period years ended september  amounts percent of total revenue amounts percent of total revenue in thousands in thousands revenue net patient service revenue gains on sales of assets and insurance recoveries total revenue costs and expenses salaries and expenses supplies and other provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization rent expense interest  net total costs and expenses income from continuing operations before minority interests and income taxes minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations years ended september  change percent change same hospitals occupancy bps n a patient days admissions adjusted admissions total surgeries outpatient revenue percentage bps n a inpatient revenue percentage bps n a total hospitals occupancy bps n a patient days admissions adjusted admissions total surgeries outpatient revenue percentage bps n a inpatient revenue percentage bps n a basis points our net patient service revenue for the period was  million as compared to  million for the period 
this change represented an increase of million or 
hospitals in operation for the entire period and the period  which we refer to as same hospitals  provided million  or  of the increase in net patient service revenue as a result of increases in surgeries and reimbursement rates 
the remaining million increase in net patient service revenue came from three hospitals we acquired in february  individual hospitals we acquired in october and april and the full year impact of our acquisitions during the period  offset slightly by decreases in other miscellaneous revenue 
net patient service revenue per adjusted admission at our same hospitals increased during the period as compared to the period 
contributing factors to such increase included improvements in medicare pricing  as well as the effect of favorably renegotiated agreements with commercial providers 
during the period  we recognized approximately million of revenue attributable to gains on dispositions of a medical office building and land in jackson  mississippi and two home health agencies 
additionally  during such period we recorded revenue attributable to insurance claim recovery gains for renovations and equipment approximating million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item accounts written off as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net patient service revenue 
foregone charges for charity care and indigent write offs  including those at williamson memorial hospital  were million or of gross patient service revenue for the period and million or of gross patient service revenue during the period 
the policy and practice at each of our hospitals is to write off a patient s entire account balance upon determining that the patient qualifies under a hospital s charity care and or indigent policy 
we believe that our practice of timely recognition of charity and indigent accounts results in the appropriate recognition of net patient service revenue and provisions for doubtful accounts 
effective june   we changed our policy to reserve of all self pay accounts receivable greater than days old prior thereto  the policy was to reserve when the account balance reached days old 
for commercial accounts receivable over days old  we also reserve of the account balance 
we believe that our decentralized management strategy  including maintaining local business office operations in each of our hospitals  significantly contributes to our effective accounts receivable management 
our hospitals also work diligently to help uninsured patients qualify for medicaid  charity care  and other state and local financial assistance programs 
salaries and benefits nominally increased as a percent of net patient service revenue to for the period from for the period 
we believe that our chief nursing officers continue to effectively manage their staffs 
same hospital salaries and benefits decreased from of net patient service revenue in the period to in the period 
we believe that this decrease is a result of our continued effective management of salary costs in response to varying patient volume and acuity  as well as lower levels of nursing vacancy and turnover 
supplies and other costs increased as a percent of net patient service revenue to for the period from for the period 
the percentage increase was due to higher costs at the hospital we acquired in october  the three hospitals we acquired in february and the hospital we acquired in april  as well as higher supply costs for certain surgical procedures eg  orthopedic implants  drug eluting stents  etc 
which demonstrated significant volume increases during the period 
our effective income tax rates were approximately and for the period and the period  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item period compared to the period the following tables summarize our results of operations for the period and the year ended september   which we refer to as the period years ended september  amounts percent of total revenue amounts percent of total revenue in thousands in thousands total revenue costs and expenses salaries and expenses supplies and other provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization rent expense interest  net write off of deferred financing costs total costs and expenses income from continuing operations before minority interests and income taxes minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations years ended september  change percent change same hospitals occupancy bps n a patient days admissions adjusted admissions total surgeries outpatient revenue percentage bps n a inpatient revenue percentage bps n a total hospitals occupancy bps n a patient days admissions adjusted admissions total surgeries outpatient revenue percentage bps n a inpatient revenue percentage bps n a basis points our net patient service revenue for the period  was  million as compared to  million for the period 
this change represented an increase of million or 
hospitals in operation for the entire period and the period  which we refer to as same hospitals  provided million  or  of the increase in net patient service revenue as a result of increases in inpatient and outpatient volume and reimbursement rate increases 
the remaining million increase in net patient service revenue came from two hospitals we acquired in august  one hospital we acquired in september and five hospitals we acquired in november  as well as from other miscellaneous revenue 
net patient service revenue per adjusted admission at our same hospitals increased during the period as compared to the period 
contributing factors to such increase included reimbursement rate increases  renegotiation of managed care contracts during the period and increased volume in our higher margin outpatient business 
accounts written off as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net patient service revenue 
foregone charges for charity care and indigent write offs  including those at williamson memorial hospital  were million or of gross patient service revenue for the period and million or of gross patient service revenue during the period 
certain of our significant policies and practices regarding charity and indigent care are discussed above under the period compared to the period 
our provision for doubtful accounts during the period was of net patient service revenue  which represents a nominal basis point increase over the period 
salaries and benefits increased as a percent of net patient service revenue to for the period from for the period  primarily as a result of higher costs at the period and the period acquisitions discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item supplies and other costs increased as a percent of net patient service revenue to for the period from for the period 
the majority of this increase was due to higher costs at acquired hospitals and increased supply costs related to drug eluting stents and orthopedic implants 
our effective income tax rates were approximately for both the period and the period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item liquidity  capital resources  and capital expenditures liquidity our cash flows from continuing operations provide the primary source of cash for our ongoing business needs 
we have historically utilized cash on hand  revolving credit facility borrowings and proceeds from debt issuances  or a combination thereof  to fund acquisitions 
the following is a summary of our recent cash flows in thousands years ended september  sources uses of cash and cash equivalents operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations net increase decrease in cash and equivalents period cash flows compared to the period cash flows operating activities our cash flows from continuing operating activities increased million or during the period compared to the period 
enhanced profitability  as well as improved asset and liability management  led to the increased cash flows from continuing operating activities during the period 
uses of cash attributable to accounts receivable in the period and the period were million and million  respectively  resulting in an increase to net cash flows from continuing operating activities of million in the period as compared to the period 
in both periods  acquisitions accounted for the majority of the increases in accounts receivable 
increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities contributed approximately million to the period increase in cash flows from continuing operating activities when compared to the period 
investing activities cash used in investing activities during the period consisted primarily of i million  in the aggregate  for the hospital we acquired in october  the three hospitals we acquired in february and the hospital we acquired in april  ii million for additions to property  plant and equipment  which primarily consisted of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities  new hospital construction and capital expenditures for one ongoing and one completed hospital replacement project  and iii a net increase in restricted funds of million 
offsetting these cash outlays were cash receipts of approximately million from sales of assets and insurance recoveries 
insurance recoveries generally have been  or will be  utilized to make reparations at the hospitals impacted by hurricane and storm activity 
during the period  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of million paid for the five hospitals we acquired in november  million for additions to property  plant and equipment and a net increase in restricted funds of million 
the property  plant and equipment additions consisted of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities and capital expenditures associated with three hospital replacement projects 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities during the period included borrowings of million under our million revolving credit agreement for the acquisition of three hospitals in february proceeds from exercises of stock options provided an additional million during such period 
principal payments on debt  payments of dividends and purchases of treasury stock used million  million and million  respectively  of cash during the period 
additionally  during such period  we used million of cash to collateralize a standby letter of credit 
cash provided by financing activities during the period included borrowings of million under our prior revolving credit agreement for the acquisition of five hospitals in november  however  we subsequently repaid such debt with cash provided by continuing operating activities during the same period 
proceeds from exercises of stock options provided an additional million during the period 
payments of dividends in the period represented a million use of cash during such period 
period cash flows compared to the period cash flows operating activities our cash flows from continuing operating activities increased during the period when compared to the period due primarily to our increased profitability 
the primary cause for the increase in our working capital was the increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable in the period as compared to the period resulted primarily from our period acquisitions accounts receivable were not purchased by us as part of such transactions and  therefore  we experienced an increase in accounts receivable during the period 
investing activities cash used in investing activities in the period consisted primarily of the cash paid for the five hospitals we acquired on november   cash paid for additions to property  plant and equipment and a net increase in restricted funds 
the property  plant and equipment additions consisted of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities and capital expenditures associated with three replacement hospital projects 
during the period  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of the cash paid for four hospitals we acquired  cash paid for additions to property  plant and equipment and a net increase in restricted funds 
the property  plant and equipment additions consisted of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities and capital expenditures associated with one replacement hospital project 
financing activities we borrowed million under our prior revolving line of credit agreement during the period to finance acquisitions and we subsequently repaid such amount with cash flows provided by continuing operating activities during the same period 
proceeds from exercises of stock options provided an additional million during the period 
we used million for payments of dividends during such period 
cash provided by financing activities in the period primarily resulted from proceeds of million from the issuance of our convertible senior subordinated notes due and million from exercises of stock options  offset by million used to retire our zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures due  million used for payments of dividends and million used to pay debt financing costs 
days sales outstanding dso at the beginning of each fiscal year  we announce a number of financial and quality objectives for the coming fiscal year  including days sales outstanding  or dso 
our dso is calculated by dividing quarterly net patient service revenue by the number of days in the quarter 
the result is divided into the net accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter to obtain our dso 
we believe that this statistic is an important measure of collections on our accounts receivable 
below is a table comparing actual consolidated dsos to our objectives our previously published dso objective for the year ending september  is to days 
september  actual dso objective for dso the variance from fiscal year and fiscal year actual dso principally resulted from our change in the provision for doubtful accounts policy for self pay accounts that we implemented during fiscal year see note g to the consolidated financial statements in item the variance from fiscal year and fiscal year actual dso resulted from acquisitions we completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year at september   we were in the process of transferring medicare and medicaid provider numbers for these acquired hospitals 
pending transfer of the provider numbers  these hospitals continued to treat medicare and medicaid patients but were unable to bill such programs for the services provided 
once we transferred these provider numbers  we were able to bill for all medicare and medicaid patients previously treated 
this circumstance contributed approximately three days to the dso for fiscal year the approximate percentage of total gross accounts receivable from continuing operations  summarized by aging category  is as follows september  days days and over days days and over medicare medicaid commercial insurance and others self pay totals in addition to dso  we utilize other quantitative and qualitative factors to analyze the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
the principal quantitative factor is a comparison of net patient service revenue to cash collections 
we analyze this statistic monthly and quarterly to validate our estimations of both revenue allowances and provisions for doubtful accounts 
the primary qualitative factors used include analyzing dso  the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net patient service revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable 
these and other factors are reviewed monthly and are closely monitored for developing trends in the accounts receivable portfolio 
we believe that virtually all accounts receivable identified as due from third party payors at the time of billing that are aged less than days past date of discharge will not convert to self pay 
however  as such accounts age  there is a likelihood that a small percentage of those accounts will convert to self pay upon denials from third party payors 
those accounts are closely monitored on a routine basis for denial potential and are reclassified as deemed necessary 
effect of legislative and regulatory action on liquidity the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs are subject to ongoing changes as a result of legislative and regulatory actions 
although we believe that these changes will continue to limit reimbursement increases under these programs  we do not believe that these changes will have a material adverse effect on our future revenue or liquidity 
nevertheless  within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations and discretion that may further affect payments made to us under those programs 
in the future  both federal and state governments might reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
additionally  any future restructuring of the financing and delivery of health care services in the united states and or the continued rise in managed care programs could have an adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
capital resources credit facilities we currently have a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that expires on may  the credit agreement allows us to borrow  on a revolving unsecured basis  up to million including standby letters of credit 
the credit agreement requires our subsidiaries other than certain exempted subsidiaries to guarantee the borrowings thereunder in the event our credit rating falls below certain thresholds 
under the credit agreement  we can elect whether the interest rate we pay is based on the prime rate or the libor rate 
our effective interest rate includes a spread above the base rate we select and is subject to modification in the event our debt rating changes 
such effective interest rate and our credit availability under the credit agreement at september  were and million  respectively 
subsequent to september   we borrowed incremental amounts aggregating million under the credit agreement  thereby reducing our availability to million as of december  under the terms of the credit agreement  we are obligated to pay certain commitment fees based upon amounts available to us for borrowing 
in addition  the credit agreement contains covenants that  without the prior consent of the lenders  limit certain of our activities  including those relating to mergers  consolidations  our ability to borrow additional money  make guarantees and grant security interests 
we have complied with our financial covenants  which are calculated at september  as follows requirement level maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio to to minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio to to on august   we executed a million unsecured demand promissory note the demand note in favor of a bank  which is to be used as a working capital line of credit in conjunction with our cash management program 
in connection therewith  our million credit agreement with such bank the prior agreement was terminated and the promissory note delivered by us thereunder was deemed cancelled and replaced by the demand note 
no balances were outstanding under the prior agreement upon its termination 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the demand note  we may borrow and repay on a revolving unsecured basis up to the principal face amount of the demand note 
all principal and accrued interest outstanding under the demand note will be immediately due and payable upon the bank s written demand 
absent such a demand  interest under the demand note shall be payable monthly and determined using the libor market index rate  as that term is defined in the demand note  plus 
the demand note s effective interest rate at september  was 
as of september   there were no amounts outstanding under either the demand note 
outstanding long term debt securities new notes and notes 
to the extent any holders of the new notes or the notes as such debt securities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item exercise their put options to require us to repurchase such securities on january  and august   respectively  we intend to use available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under our million revolving credit agreement to purchase such notes 
although we do not believe that all of the put options under the new notes and the notes will be exercised during the year ending september   such a situation could result in a capital requirement beyond the availability of our aforementioned funding sources 
in order to meet these potential put obligations  we intend to consider various long term financing alternatives  including  but not limited to  expanding or supplementing our million revolving credit agreement 
we believe that the a general corporate credit ratings assigned to us as of december  by both standard poor s ratings services and fitchratings are indicative of our ability to procure financing as may be necessary 
dividends and stock repurchase program on september   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share on our common stock  payable on november   to stockholders of record at the close of business on november  on august   we announced that our board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to ten million shares of our common stock 
effective november   we completed our stock repurchase program through open market purchases at an aggregate cost of approximately million for the full ten million shares 
we funded our dividend payments and our stock repurchase program with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under our million revolving credit agreement 
see market for the registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities in item standby letters of credit at september   we maintained approximately million of standby letters of credit in favor of third parties 
should any or all of these letters of credit be drawn upon  we intend to satisfy such obligations with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and  if necessary  amounts available under our million revolving credit agreement 
capital expenditures our business strategy calls for us to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our acquisition criteria 
the acquisition of hospitals accounted for a significant portion of our capital expenditures in each of the years in the three year period ended september  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of our acquisitions during such three year period 
we generally fund acquisitions  replacement hospitals and other ongoing capital expenditure requirements with available cash balances  cash generated from operating activities and  if necessary  amounts available under our million revolving credit agreement 
during the period  certain proceeds from the notes  which were sold in july and august  provided an additional source of funding for our five hospital acquisition completed on november  fiscal year transactions on december   we announced the negotiation of an agreement to acquire st 
joseph hospital  a bed general acute care hospital in augusta  georgia 
pursuant to applicable state law  the execution of a definitive purchase agreement and closing of the transaction are subject to review and approval by the georgia attorney general s office 
effective december   we acquired gilmore memorial hospital  a bed general acute care hospital in amory  mississippi 
the purchase price of this acquisition was approximately million 
on november   we announced the negotiation of an agreement to acquire barrow community hospital  a bed general acute care hospital in winder  georgia 
on december   the georgia attorney general s office approved the transaction and we expect that it will close on or about december  on november   we announced the execution of a definitive agreement to acquire of orlando regional st 
cloud hospital  an bed general acute care hospital in st 
cloud  florida 
orlando regional healthcare  a not for profit organization  will retain a ownership interest in the hospital 
we expect that this transaction will close on or before january we plan to divest williamson memorial hospital in williamson  west virginia during the year ending september  a number of hospital renovation and or expansion projects were underway at september  we do not believe that any of these projects is individually significant or that they represent  in the aggregate  a significant commitment of our resources 
specifically  we plan to complete construction of our replacement hospital in carlisle  pennsylvania in january and our collier regional medical center in naples  florida during the fall of during the year ending september   we anticipate that we will spend approximately million for new and replacement hospital construction 
additionally  we are obligated to construct a new facility at our monroe  georgia location within the next three years  however  the cost for this project has not yet been determined 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements except as set forth in the table below  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
as of september   contractual obligations for the next five fiscal years ending september and thereafter including principal and interest and other commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by year ending september  contractual obligations thereafter long term debt  excluding our million revolving credit facility a loans outstanding under our million revolving credit facility capital leases operating leases b total contractual obligations commitment expiration by year ending september  other commitments not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet thereafter letters of credit c physician commitments d other e total commitments a holders of the notes  new notes and notes as such debt securities are defined in note to the consolidated financial statement in item are able to put such notes to us at various predetermined dates from to for purposes of the above table  we assumed that all of the new notes and the notes would be put to us during the year ending september  interest rates at september  were used to estimate interest payments on variable rate debt in the above table 
b obligations under operating leases for real property  real property master leases and equipment 
the real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near our hospitals for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income to the owners of the property 
we sublease space in these buildings to third parties 
future operating lease obligations are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
c amounts relate primarily to letters of credit outstanding with financial institutions 
the letters of credit principally serve as security for self insured portions of our insurance programs  guarantees for the construction of new and replacement hospitals and obligations to utility companies 
d see note p to the consolidated financial statements in item for discussion of certain physician and physician group guarantees and commitments 
e other primarily includes our new hospital construction and replacement hospital construction projects but excludes our monroe  georgia construction project because the cost thereof has not yet been determined 
impact of seasonality and inflation seasonality we typically experience higher patient volume and net patient service revenue in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year because  generally  more people become ill during the winter months  which in turn results in significant increases in the number of patients we treat during those months 
inflation the health care industry is labor intensive and is subject to wage and related employee benefit expense increases  especially during periods of inflation and when shortages of skilled labor occur 
there is currently a shortage of skilled nursing staff throughout the health care industry  which has caused nursing salaries to increase 
we have addressed the nursing staff needs in our markets by increasing wages  improving hospital working conditions and fostering relationships with local nursing schools 
we do not believe that the inflationary trend in nursing salaries or the nursing shortage will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  suppliers  utilities and other vendors pass on rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we believe that we have been able to offset increases in our operating costs through a combination of increasing prices  achieving quantity discounts for purchases through our group purchasing agreement and by more efficient utilization of resources 
although we have implemented cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses  we cannot predict our ability to recover or offset future cost increases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations  primarily as a result of our million revolving credit agreement that has a variable rate 
however  interest rates on substantially all of our long term debt at september  were fixed and  accordingly  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on us but increases in interest rates would correspondingly increase interest expense associated with our future borrowings 
we do not currently use derivative instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of any of our debt 
at september   the fair value and carrying amount of our fixed rate debt  including capital lease obligations  was approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  at such date  both the fair value and carrying amount of our variable rate debt was approximately million
