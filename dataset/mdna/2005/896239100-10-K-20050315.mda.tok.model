item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those listed under risks and uncertainties 
executive level overview trimble s foundation remains positioning technology 
we have augmented this technology with wireless communication and software capabilities in order to enable us to participate in a wider number of markets and to play a more central role in those markets 
our efforts to market these technologies can generally be characterized as falling into the categories of either end user markets or component markets 
the engineering and construction  field solutions  and mobile solutions segments can be broadly described as end user markets and the component technologies and portfolio technologies segments can be described as components markets 
in the end user markets we provide a value added solution to the end user 
typically this requires a solution that includes a hardware platform  significant applications software  and substantial levels of customer support 
in the components businesses  we typically sell to another company that adds significant value and brings the solution to the end user 
the segments constituting the end user  solutions activities  make up over of our revenue 
the critical success factors in these businesses center around attaining a significant understanding of the end users needs  applying that knowledge to create highly innovative products  integrating those products into an effective system  and establishing a proficient global  third party distribution 
the components businesses require different characteristics to be successful 
the customer is typically an oem  system integrator  or other third party that integrates our components into a system 
to satisfy this customer group  our focus is on price  product functionality  and quality 
with recent product introductions we have begun to add higher functionality into our products in order to provide greater value and potentially capture higher average selling prices for our offerings 
for example  our trimtrac product integrates gps and gsm cellular technologies into a fully functional location device 
it establishes a new asset tracking or security capability at an aggressive price point and opens up a new class of customers and applications which were previously not available to us 
during we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in four categories 
reinforcing our position in existing markets generally  we believe that our markets provide us with additional  substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods 
in we continued to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels to realize these opportunities 
the acquisitions of geonav and tracernet provided us with additional software capability and applications knowledge 
a number of new products  such as the easy guide plus  strengthened our competitive position and created new value for the user 
the first full year of operation of our joint venture with nikon proved successful in extending our position in surveying instruments 
extend our position in existing markets through new product categories we are utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenues by bringing new products to existing users 
a example was the introduction of asset and fleet management services to the construction industry 
bring existing technology to new markets we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets  and positioned ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth 
our efforts in china  india  russia  korea and eastern europe all reflected improving financial results  with the promise of more in the future 
pioneer completely new markets in we introduced the trimtrac product and trimble outdoors 
both products embed new feature sets and are intended to address markets not traditionally served by trimble 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting polices 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue is reduced by a sales return reserve as described under allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
revenue from purchased extended warranty and support agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty support period 
substantially all technology licenses and research revenue have consisted of initial license fees and royalties  which were recognized when earned  provided we had no remaining obligations 
contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
our shipment terms for us orders  and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center are typically fca free carrier shipping point  except certain sales to us government agencies which are shipped fob destination 
fca shipping point means that we fulfill the obligation to deliver when the goods are handed over  cleared for export  and into the charge of the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point 
if no precise point is indicated by the buyer  we may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier will take the goods into carrier s charge 
other international orders are shipped fob destination  which means these international orders are not recognized as revenue until the product is delivered and title has transferred to the buyer or fca shipping point 
fob destination means that we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point 
revenue to distributors and resellers is recognized upon delivery  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 
when a sale involves multiple elements  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
the amount of product revenue allocated to an individual element is limited to the lesser of its relative fair value or the amount not contingent on our delivery of other elements under the arrangement  regardless of the probability of our performance 
our software arrangements generally consist of a license fee and post contract customer support pcs 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate 
the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method  and revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and there are no remaining obligations 
revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared with million as of january  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million  compared with million as of january  we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances  credit quality  historical experience  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates experienced in the ordinary course of business 
the reserve for sales returns as of december  and january  included million and million  respectively  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation our inventories  net balance was million as of december   compared with million as of january  our inventory allowances as of december  were million  compared with million as of january  our inventory is recorded at the lower of standard cost or market net realizable value 
we generally use a standard cost accounting system to value inventory and these standards are reviewed a minimum of once a year and multiple times a year in our most active manufacturing plants 
we adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance decreased by million in fiscal and million in fiscal approximately million of the valuation allowance at december  and million at january  relates to the tax benefit of stock option deductions  which will be credited to equity if and when realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income  resolution of tax uncertainties and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
goodwill impairment goodwill as of december  was million  compared with million as of january  we performed goodwill impairment tests at the end of the fiscal third quarter of and for each reporting unit and found there was no impairment of our goodwill 
we will continue to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal third quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for goodwill  the annual impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit s carrying value  then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit s goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material negative change in our relationships with significant customers 
accounting for long lived assets including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using straight line methods over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model  or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments  or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
warranty costs the liability for product warranties was million as of december   compared with million as of january  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our warranty liability 
the warranty periods for our products are generally between one and three years 
selected military programs may require extended warranty periods up to years  certain tds products have a five year or day warranty period  and certain nikon products have a five year warranty period 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs  and costs incurred by third parties performing warranty work on our behalf 
our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 
stock compensation we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan 
accordingly  we do not recognize compensation cost for stock options granted at a price equal to fair market value 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the plans we operate  and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the pro forma effects to reported net income and earnings per share for fiscal   and as if we had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options granted at grant date 
investment in joint ventures we have adopted the equity method of accounting for our investments in the caterpillar and nikon joint ventures 
this requires that we record our share of the joint ventures profits or losses in a given fiscal period 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for joint venture accounting 
upon the formation of our caterpillar joint venture in april  we received a cash distribution of million 
we have elected to treat the cash distribution as a deferred gain  being amortized to the extent that losses are attributable from the caterpillar joint venture under the equity method described above 
when and if the joint venture is profitable on a sustainable basis and future operating losses are not anticipated  then we will recognize as a gain  the portion of the million  which is unamortized 
to the extent that it is possible that we will have any future funding obligation relating to the caterpillar joint venture  then the relevant amount of the million will be deferred until such time that the funding obligation no longer exists 
as of december   the balance of the unamortized deferred gain was million 
recent business developments trimble outdoors during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced our newest business  trimble outdoors 
trimble outdoors is a consumer business utilizing gps enabled cell phones to provide information for outdoor recreational activities 
trimble outdoors performance is reported under our portfolio segment 
geonav on july  we acquired geonav gmbh  a small provider of customized field data collection solutions for the cadastral survey market in europe 
we expect the acquisition to augment our capability for localization of our products in europe 
geonav s performance is reported under our engineering and construction segment 
tracernet corporation on march  we acquired tracernet corporation of virginia  a provider of wireless fleet management solutions 
we expect the tracernet acquisition to offer more diverse and complete fleet management solutions 
tracernet s performance is reported under our mobile solutions segment 
pacific crest corporation on january  we acquired pacific crest corporation of santa clara  a supplier of wireless data communication systems for positioning and environmental monitoring applications 
we expect the pacific crest acquisition to further enhance our wireless data communications capabilities in the engineering and construction business segment 
results of operations overview the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 
december  january  january  fiscal years ended dollars in thousands total consolidated revenue    gross margin    total consolidated operating income    basis of presentation we have a week fiscal year  ending on the friday nearest to december  which for fiscal was december  fiscal and fiscal were week years and fiscal a week year 
as a result of the extra week in fiscal  year over year results are not exactly comparable 
thus  due to the inherent nature of adopting a week fiscal year  the company  analysts  shareholders  investors  and others will have to make appropriate adjustments to any analysis performed when comparing our activities and results in fiscal years that contain weeks to those that contain the standard weeks 
impact of weaker us dollar on operating results in fiscal the depreciation of the us dollar versus major european currencies positively impacted revenues by approximately million in fiscal when compared with rates used throughout fiscal as a result of our significant manufacturing  distribution  research and development  and selling expenses incurred outside of the us  the weaker us dollar negatively impacted our operating income by approximately million in fiscal when compared with rates used throughout fiscal revenue in fiscal  total revenue increased by million or to million from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to stronger performances in most of our operating segments driven by the new product offerings and increased penetration in the markets we serve primarily engineering and construction and field solutions  expanded distribution and selective acquisitions primarily mobile solutions and portfolio technologies  as well the positive impact of the weaker us dollar on revenues generated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
total revenue in fiscal increased by million or to million from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the same factors outlined above as all of our operating segments demonstrated stronger performances versus prior periods 
total revenue outside the united states comprised approximately in  in  and in during the fiscal year  north and south america represented  europe  the middle east and africa represented  and asia represented of total revenues 
in fiscal  the united states comprised approximately of total revenues 
we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenues in fiscal   and it is possible  however  that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 
gross margin our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix  pricing  distribution channel used  the effects of production volumes  new product start up costs  and foreign currency translations 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margin percentage for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was due to changes in the mix of products sold  principally related to increased sales of lower margin nikon branded survey and construction products  our agriculture products  pricing pressure in our component technologies business which typically demonstrates increased unit volumes coupled with declining unit prices  the impact of the weaker us dollar on our non us manufacturing  and distribution costs 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal and in fiscal the slight decrease in gross margin percentage for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was due primarily to the introduction of the nikon products in the third quarter  which was responsible for a margin decline of approximately 
this was partially offset by stronger sales of handheld survey products  gis  wireless infrastructure  survey products as well as our ongoing focus on product cost reductions 
because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets  market pressures on unit selling prices  fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs  including increases in component prices and other factors  current level gross margins cannot be assured 
in addition  should the global economic conditions deteriorate  gross margin could be further adversely impacted 
operating income operating income as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase is driven by disciplined management of operating expenses and greater leverage due to revenue growth 
the operating expenses represented of total revenue in fiscal as compared to in fiscal results by segment to achieve distribution  marketing  production  and technology advantages in our targeted markets  we manage our operations in the following five segments engineering and construction  field solutions  component technologies  mobile solutions  and portfolio technologies 
operating income loss is net revenue less operating expenses  excluding general corporate expenses  amortization of purchased intangibles  restructuring charges  non operating income expense  and income taxes 
the following table is a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 
december  january  january  fiscal years ended dollars in thousands engineering and construction revenue    segment revenue as a percent of total revenue operating income    operating income as a percent of segment revenue field solutions revenue    segment revenue as a percent of total revenue operating income    operating income as a percent of segment revenue component technologies revenue    segment revenue as a percent of total revenue operating income    operating income as a percent of segment revenue mobile solutions revenue    revenue as a percent of total consolidated revenue operating loss    operating loss as a percent of segment revenue portfolio technologies revenue    segment revenue as a percent of total revenue operating income loss   operating income loss as a percent of segment revenue a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes follows january  january  january  fiscal years ended in thousands consolidated segment operating income    unallocated corporate expense    amortization of purchased intangible assets    restructuring charges   non operating expense  net    consolidated income before income taxes    engineering and construction engineering and construction revenues increased by million or while segment operating income increased by million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal the relatively strong environment of fiscal continued into fiscal  resulting in continued robust demand for survey  machine control  and laser products 
in addition  the full year effects for nikon branded products contributed to the year over year increase 
targeted new product introductions  such as the servo driven station  provided improved market penetration 
the weaker us dollar also contributed to increased revenues in this operating segment 
operating income increased at a higher rate than revenue growth due to greater operating leverage on expenses 
engineering and construction revenues increased by million or during fiscal as compared to fiscal approximately half of the revenue increase was driven by new product introductions and our increased marketing efforts 
the remaining increase was split evenly between geographic expansion  especially in asia and russia  and the impact of the weaker us dollar 
segment operating income increased due to higher revenues that were partially offset by increased operating expenses outside the united states largely driven by the weaker us dollar  increased research and development spending on certain programs as we continue to invest in developing next generation technology  and lower margins earned on the sale of nikon products 
overall  segment operating income remained consistent at of revenues 
field solutions field solutions revenues increased by approximately million or while segment operating income increased by million or for fiscal year as compared to fiscal revenues increased primarily as a result of higher demand for both automated and manual guidance products in the agricultural market 
in particular  revenues were enhanced by the introduction of ez guide r plus 
we saw increases in our gis product lines due to increases in our dealer and distributor business 
additionally  programs designed to expand our distribution channel by supplementing adding value added  solutions focused business partners to our traditional dealer profile were successful 
in addition  we saw improved results in europe and increased opportunities in china 
increases in segment operating income were primarily due to higher revenues 
field solutions revenues increased by approximately million or while segment operating income increased by million or for fiscal year as compared to fiscal revenues were up year over year due to continued strong sales of the geoexplorer r ce series handhelds released at the end of fiscal  and due to the expansion of our automatic guidance products onto new agricultural vehicles 
segment operating income increased in from the fiscal year primarily due to higher revenues 
this increase was partially offset by fractionally lower gross margins and more investment in research and development and sales functions 
this enabled the segment operating income to increase from to of revenues 
component technologies component technologies revenues increased by million or  while segment operating income decreased by million or for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal revenues increased primarily due to higher demand from vehicle navigation and tracking customers  partially offset by the decline in demand from wireless infrastructure customers 
the segment operating income decrease was primarily due to pricing pressures from the embedded and in vehicle navigation product lines  a less favorable product mix  and increased spending for development of new categories of products 
component technologies revenues increased by million or  while segment operating income increased by million or for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased demand from our existing wireless infrastructure customers 
segment operating income increased from to of revenues 
the increase was primarily due to a reduction in costs of goods sold due to the transfer of the manufacturing of our products to china  reduced costs of raw materials  increased revenues and higher margins aided by favorable product mix 
mobile solutions mobile solutions revenues increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due primarily to increases sales into the construction materials market  higher dealer sales and a significant enterprise sale 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the acquisition of tracernet to strengthen our presence in this segment 
the benefits of the integration were not fully reflected until the fourth quarter of fiscal and the full year impact of these activities will not be realized until fiscal segment operating loss decreased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to increased revenues which was largely offset by increased expenses related to the integration of the tracernet acquisition 
mobile solutions revenues increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due primarily to an increase in our crosscheck product sales and higher fleet management services revenues as a result of an expanded customer base 
segment operating loss decreased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to increased revenues and lower operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased by approximately million primarily due to a reduction in outside services and our personnel related to the completion of our telvisant system 
portfolio technologies portfolio technologies revenues increased by million or while segment operating income increased by million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases in revenues and operating income were primarily due to the inclusion of full year results of applanix  acquired in july  and higher sales of our military and advanced systems products 
portfolio technologies revenues increased by million or for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal the increase in revenues was mostly driven by the inclusion of revenue from applanix acquired in  while offset by lower revenue of military related products 
segment operating income decreased by million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to weaker operating results from military products 
research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses the following table shows research and development r d  sales and marketing  and general and administrative g a expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the fiscal years ended  and and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below 
december  january  january  fiscal years ended in thousands research and development    sales and marketing    general and administrative    overall  r d  sales and marketing  and g a increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal incremental expenses arising from acquisitions were approximately million and the impact of the weaker us dollar on non us operating expenses were approximately million 
research and development expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to sustaining engineering expenses and costs incurred related to new product development  continued investment in next generation technologies  and the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
research and development expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to continued investment in next generation technology primarily in the engineering and construction segment  the weakness of the us dollar versus major european and new zealand currencies  and also the inclusion of the research and development expenses from applanix after its acquisition in july overall spending remained relatively constant at approximately of revenues 
we expect to continue to devote resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and that to leverage our leading technology and meet the changing requirements of our customers  we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  but decreased as a percent of total revenues 
the majority of the increase was due to the increase in revenue  promotional programs associated with new products  and the foreign exchange impact on expenses in our non us operations 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher revenue  increased sales efforts mostly in emerging geographic areas such as china and russia  the impact of the weaker us dollar in europe  and the inclusion of applanix sales and marketing expenses not applicable in the prior fiscal year 
we intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts across all the geographies and markets we serve in order to increase market awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers worldwide 
our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for our products 
general and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of g a expenses from acquisitions  compliance with sarbanes oxley  and bad debt expenses of million 
spending overall remained relatively constant at approximately of revenues 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased by million and represented of revenues compared with in fiscal in fiscal  we experienced higher bad debt expenses  primarily due to the bankruptcy of a large japanese distributor 
in addition  in fiscal we incurred million less in information systems expenses 
these reductions were offset in fiscal by lower sublease income received  expenses from applanix after the acquisition in july  and higher compensation costs 
other operating expenses restructuring charges restructuring charges of million  million  and million were recorded in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the charges in fiscal were primarily related to severance costs due to the realignment of trimble mobile solutions  inc  while charges in fiscal were primarily related to our japanese office relocation due to the nikon trimble joint venture formation as a result of these actions  the headcount of the affected operations decreased by  and in fiscal   and  respectively 
as of december   the remaining accrual balance of million is primarily related to severance expected to be paid in fiscal amortization of purchased and other intangible assets december  january  january  fiscal years ended in thousands amortization of purchased intangibles    amortization of other intangible assets amortization of purchased and other intangible assets    amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented of revenue in fiscal  having increased million from fiscal when it represented of revenue 
amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented of revenue in fiscal  having decreased by approximately million from fiscal when it represented of revenue 
the decrease was due to certain spectra intangibles being fully amortized during fiscal non operating expense  net the following table shows non operating expense  net for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those expenses below december  january  january  fiscal years ended in thousands interest income interest expense    foreign exchange loss expenses for affiliated operations  net    other income expense   total non operating expense  net    non operating expense  net decreased by million or during fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to lower interest expense after the repayment of the principal balance of a subordinated note in june  the write off of million of debt issuance costs as a result of our debt refinancing in june and million related to the write off of the remaining unamortized portion of the warrants issued to spectra physics holdings  inc the increases in expense for affiliated operations were primarily due to our higher construction machine control revenues which led to increased impact from the pricing effects of transactions between us and the caterpillar joint venture 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding joint ventures 
this was partially offset by million related to our share of profits in the nikon trimble joint venture 
the increase in other income expense was primarily due to a net gain related to the sale of an investment 
non operating expense  net decreased by million or during fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to a reduction in interest expense of million offset by an increase in expenses for affiliated operations 
the increase in expenses for affiliated operations is primarily due to the full year impact of transfer pricing effects on transactions between us and our caterpillar joint venture  which commenced operations in april in addition  we recorded approximately million relating to our share of the losses in our nikon joint venture established in in fiscal  interest expense decreased by approximately million due to continued debt repayment during the year of approximately million  combined with the effect of lower interest rates 
offsetting the lower debt interest  during the year  we recorded approximately million of interest expense due to the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of our debt refinancing in june  as well as million related to the unamortized portion of warrants associated with the principal balance of a subordinated note 
income tax provision our effective income tax rates for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
the fiscal income tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate of due primarily to non us taxes and the inability to realize the benefit of net operating losses 
the and income tax rates are less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily due to the realization of benefits from net operating losses and other previously reserved deferred tax assets 
we expect our effective income tax rate to go up in fiscal year because of the significant realization of the valuation allowance for deferred taxes in fiscal year the company expects its effective income tax rate to approximate 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was signed into law providing changes in the tax law including an incentive to repatriate undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of these provisions  including assessing the details of the act  analyzing the funds available for repatriation  the economic cost of doing so and assessing the qualified uses of repatriated funds 
however  given the preliminary stage of our evaluation  it is not possible to determine the impact to our fiscal year income tax provision 
the company expects to complete its evaluation by september  litigation matters from time to time  we are involved in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
there are no known claims or pending litigation that are expected to have a material effect on our overall financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements other than lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities  guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in transferred assets  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we do not have any interest in  or relationship with  any special purpose entities 
liquidity and capital resources december  january  january  as of and for the fiscal year ended dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents    as a percentage of total assets accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso inventory turns per year total debt    cash provided by operating activities    cash used in investing activities    cash provided used by financing activities   net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    we have reclassified deferred revenues previously included in accounts receivable  net to the liabilities section in the consolidated balance sheets in fiscal year and for all periods presented 
as such  the dso calculation for all fiscal periods has been restated 
cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million from fiscal the increase was primarily due to cash generated by operating activities  partially offset by cash used in investing activities for acquisitions and cash used in financing activities for debt repayment 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was million  as compared to million in fiscal the increase of million was primarily driven by the million increase in net income during fiscal compared to fiscal and better management of working capital 
our ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on profitability  the rate of collections of accounts receivable  our inventory turns  and our ability to manage other areas of working capital 
our accounts receivable days for sales outstanding decreased from days at the end of fiscal to days at the end of fiscal our inventory turns was unchanged at four at the end of fiscal and cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to cash acquisitions and investment in capital equipment 
during fiscal  we spent approximately million on capital expenditures 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal however  during fiscal  we repaid approximately million of debt related to our previous credit facility 
these debt payments were funded by cash provided by operating activities  and the issuance of common stock to employees pursuant to our stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan of approximately million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  together with our credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents as well as access to million of cash under the terms of our revolver loans 
we expect fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately million to million  primarily for computer equipment  software  manufacturing tools and test equipment  and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion 
decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 
debt at the end of fiscal  our total debt was approximately million as compared with approximately million at the end of fiscal this balance primarily consists of million outstanding under a term loan and million outstanding under a senior secured revolving credit facility 
on june   we obtained a new credit facility comprising of a term loan and revolver in the amount of million that enabled us to pay off our indebtedness under our previous credit facility and a subordinated note used to finance the spectra physics acquisition 
the new credit facility is secured by all material assets of our company  except for a portion of assets that are not pledged due to foreign tax considerations 
financial covenants of the credit facility include leverage  fixed charge  and minimum net worth tests 
at december  and as of the date of this report  we are in compliance with all debt covenants 
the amortized principal  interest  and commitment fees due under the credit facility are paid quarterly 
under the four year term loan portion of the credit facility  we are due to make payments excluding interest of approximately million in each of the next two fiscal years and  and million in fiscal under the terms of the credit facility  we are allowed to pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock up to of net income in the previous fiscal year 
for additional discussion of our debt  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less more than than total year years years years in thousands total debt including interest    operating leases      other purchase obligations and commitments    total      total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities  or certain obligations as discussed below 
as of december   million of our total debt was subject to variable quarterly interest rates 
per our loan agreement  we pay a three month libor rate plus a certain spread that depends on our leverage ratio 
our spread is expected to be over the remaining life of the debt 
we have assumed a three month libor rate of for the first quarter of fiscal and have forecasted an increase of basis point quarter over quarter to a maximum of 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further financial information regarding long term debt other purchase obligations and commitments represent open purchase orders for material purchases with our customers and a forecasted commitment with a supplier for outsourced services as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our pension obligation which is not included in the table above  and is included in other non current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets  is disclosed at note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method  and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 and allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
the requirements of sfas no 
r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  if we had applied the provisions of sfas no 
r to the financial statements for the period ending december   assuming that adoption would result in amounts similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas r  net income would have been reduced by approximately million 
sfas no 
r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition  which may be back to the original issuance of sfas no 
or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
we are currently evaluating these transition methods 
risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the following risk factors  in addition to the other information contained in this form k and in any other documents to which we refer you in this form k  before purchasing our securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may affect our revenue  expenses and earnings per share 
we have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments so that we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements 
as a result  if orders and shipments differ from what we predict  we may incur additional expenses and build excess inventory  which may require additional reserves and allowances 
any significant change in our customers purchasing patterns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and reported earnings per share for a particular quarter 
our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions  such as seasonality  late quarter purchases  weather  and other potential issues 
due in part to the buying patterns of our customers  a significant portion of our quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter  although our operating expenses tend to remain fairly predictable 
engineering and construction purchases tend to occur in early spring  and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year 
concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters 
additionally  a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter 
if for any reason expected sales are deferred  orders are not received  or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter  our operating results and reported earnings per share for that quarter could be significantly impacted 
we are dependent on a specific manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on specific suppliers of critical parts for our products 
we are substantially dependent upon solectron corporation in california  china and mexico as our preferred manufacturing partner for many of our gps products previously manufactured out of our sunnyvale facilities 
under the agreement with solectron  we provide to solectron a twelve month product forecast and place purchase orders with solectron at least thirty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers depending on production lead time 
although purchase orders placed with solectron are cancelable  the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from solectron all inventory not returnable or usable by other solectron customers 
accordingly  if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products  we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from solectron to meet customers delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories  if such inventories are not usable by other solectron customers 
our current contract with solectron continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice 
in addition  we rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components 
we have experienced shortages of components in the past 
our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand  and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 
our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
results in any period could be affected by o changes in market demand  o competitive market conditions  o market acceptance of existing or new products  o fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  o the cost and availability of components  o our ability to manufacture and ship products  o the mix of our customer base and sales channels  o the mix of products sold  o our ability to expand our sales and marketing organization effectively  o our ability to attract and retain key technical and managerial employees  o the timing of shipments of products under contracts and o general global economic conditions 
in addition  demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries 
due to the foregoing factors  our operating results in one or more future periods are expected to be subject to significant fluctuations 
the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 
our gross margin is subject to fluctuation 
our gross margin is affected by a number of factors  including product mix  product pricing  cost of components  foreign currency exchange rates and manufacturing costs 
for example  sales of nikon branded products generally have lower gross margins as compared to our gps survey products 
absent other factors  a shift in sales towards nikon branded products would lead to a reduction in our overall gross margins 
a decline in gross margin could potentially negatively impact our earnings per share 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires us to include an internal control report of management in our annual report on form k 
for fiscal we satisfied the requirements of section  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments 
a system of controls  however well designed and operated  cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met 
in addition  the design of a control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events 
because of the inherent limitations of control systems  there is only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their stated goals under all potential future conditions 
we are dependent on new products 
our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis 
we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products  enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products 
we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products 
our development stage products may not be successfully completed or  if developed  may not achieve significant customer acceptance 
if we were unable to successfully define  develop and introduce competitive new products  and enhance existing products  our future results of operations would be adversely affected 
development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict  and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products 
the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success 
a delay in new product introductions could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
our products may contain errors or defects  which could result in damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased service costs  warranty claims and litigation 
our devices are complex and must meet stringent requirements 
we warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time  depending on the product 
in addition  certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses 
if invoked  these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory  or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective 
we must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market  and we have a history of frequently introducing new products 
products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released 
in general  our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun  which could result in damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources  increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims and litigation which could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances 
we believe that in certain business opportunities our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants  such as caterpillar  nikon  mcneilus  and cnh global 
our failure to form and maintain such alliances  or the pre emption of such alliances by actions of other competitors or us  will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets 
no assurances can be given that we will not experience problems from current or future alliances or that we will realize value from any such strategic alliances 
we are dependent on the availability of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 
our gps technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government s gps 
the gps sps operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services 
international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu  a specialized technical agency of the united nations 
these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference 
any itu reallocation of radio frequency bands  including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum  may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which would  in turn  cause a material adverse effect on our operating results 
many of our products use other radio frequency bands  together with the gps signal  to provide enhanced gps capabilities  such as real time kinematic precision 
the continuing availability of these non gps radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gps products to our precision survey and construction machine controls markets 
any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which would  in turn  cause a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  unwanted emissions from mobile satellite services and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or in band from licensed and unlicensed devices may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results 
the fcc continually receives proposals for novel technologies and services  such as ultra wideband technologies  which may seek to operate in  or across  the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps and other public safety services 
adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps and other radio frequency spectrum also used in our products may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we are subject to the adverse impact of radio frequency congestion 
we have certain products  such as gps rtk systems  and surveying and mapping systems that use integrated radio communication technology requiring access to available radio frequencies allocated by the fcc or the ntia in the case of federal government users of this equipment for which the end user is required to obtain a license in order to operate their equipment 
in addition  access to these frequencies by state agencies is under management by state radio communications coordinators 
some bands are experiencing congestion that excludes their availability for access by state agencies in some states 
to reduce congestion  the fcc announced that it will require migration of radio technology from wideband to narrowband operations in these bands 
in december  the fcc stayed the effectiveness of its new rules until it acts on petitions requesting a reconsideration of this new requirement 
the stay is indefinite at this point and the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time 
an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies by end users  and for new products to comply with fcc requirements  could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
many of our products rely on the gps satellite system 
the gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage 
the satellites were originally designed to have lives of years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate 
however  of the current deployment of satellites in place  some have already been in operation for years 
to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible 
if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable  there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites 
a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of gps satellites over a long period  or that the policies of the us government for the use of gps without charge will remain unchanged 
however  a presidential decision directive marks the first time in the evolution of gps that access for civilian use free of direct user fees is specifically recognized and supported by presidential policy reaffirmed in in addition  presidential policy has been complemented by corresponding legislation  signed into law 
because of ever increasing commercial applications of gps  other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of gps signals 
any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select gps based systems instead of products based on competing technologies 
many of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps  such as the wide area augmentation system waas and national differential gps system ndgps 
many of these augmentation systems are operated by the federal government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems 
any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems could result in decreased user capability thereby impacting our markets 
the european governments have begun development of an independent satellite navigation system  known as galileo 
we believe we will have access to the signal design to develop compatible receivers 
however  if access to the signal structure is delayed it may have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 
acts of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruption to our economy and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our credit agreement contains financial covenants 
on june   we executed a credit agreement with scotia capital and certain other banks which provides for financial commitments totaling up to million 
this credit facility contains financial covenants regarding minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum leverage ratio which are extremely sensitive to changes in earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
in turn  ebitda is highly correlated to revenues and costs 
if we default on one or more covenants  we will have to obtain either negotiated waivers or amendments to the credit agreement 
if we were unable to obtain such waivers or amendments  the banks would have the right to accelerate the payment of our outstanding obligations under the credit agreement which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and viability as an operating company 
an event of default under any debt instrument  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we face risks in investing in and integrating new acquisitions 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products entail numerous risks  including o potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration  o diversion of management s attention  o loss of key employees of acquired operations  o the difficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies  o the potential disruption of our ongoing business  o unanticipated expenses related to such integration  o the correct assessment of the relative percentages of in process research and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset  o the impairment of relationships with employees and customers of either an acquired company or our own business  o the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired business  and o inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities 
as a result of such acquisitions  we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions 
changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets 
in addition  losses incurred by a company in which we have an investment may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to write down the value of such investment 
any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and compliance with debt covenants 
we face competition in our markets 
our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price  quality and performance of our products  the level of customer service  the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets 
within each of our markets  we encounter direct competition from other gps  optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger us and non us competitors and new market entrants  some of which may be our current customers 
the competition in the future may  in some cases  result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products 
we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully  and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors  many of whom have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than we do 
we are dependent on proprietary technology 
our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology  and we rely on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated  circumvented  and challenged 
the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us 
in addition  effective copyright  patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in certain countries 
the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 
the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings 
we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents  it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market  take a license from such patent holders  or redesign our products 
we do not believe any of our products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  but we cannot be certain they do not do so 
in addition  the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations 
such events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues or profitability 
we must carefully manage our future growth 
growth in our sales or continued expansion in the scope of our operations could strain our current management  financial  manufacturing and other resources  and may require us to implement and improve a variety of operating  financial and other systems  procedures  and controls 
specifically we have experienced strain in our financial and order management system 
we are expanding our sales  accounting  manufacturing  and other information systems to meet these challenges 
problems associated with any improvement or expansion of these systems  procedures or controls may adversely affect our operations and these systems  procedures or controls may not be designed  implemented or improved in a cost effective and timely manner 
any failure to implement  improve and expand such systems  procedures  and controls in a timely and efficient manner could harm our growth strategy and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to achieve our business objectives 
we are dependent on retaining and attracting highly skilled development and managerial personnel 
our ability to maintain our competitive technological position will depend  in a large part  on our ability to attract  motivate  and retain highly qualified development and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified employees in our industry and locations is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract  motivate  and retain enough qualified employees necessary for the future continued development of our business and products 
we may encounter problems associated with international operations and sales 
our customers are located throughout the world 
sales to unaffiliated customers in non us locations represented approximately of our revenues in our fiscal year  of our revenues in our fiscal year  and in our fiscal year  respectively 
in addition  we have significant international operations  including a joint venture  manufacturing facilities  sales personnel and customer support operations 
we have sales offices outside the us 
our non us manufacturing facilities are in sweden  canada  france  and germany  and we have a regional fulfillment center in the netherlands 
our non us presence exposes us to risks not faced by wholly us companies 
specifically  we have experienced issues relating to integration of non us operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  longer payment cycles  and currency fluctuations 
additionally  we face the following risks  among others o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o political  legal and economic instability in non us markets  particularly in those markets in which we maintain manufacturing and research facilities  o difficulties in staffing and management  o language and cultural barriers  o seasonal reductions in business activities in the summer months in europe and some other countries  o war and acts of terrorism  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
in certain non us markets  there may be reluctance to purchase products based on gps technology  given the control of gps by the us government 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states  and as such  we face exposure to movements in non us currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
in fiscal  the us dollar continued to weaken against several major currencies in which we do business  adversely impacting our financial results 
the weaker us dollar negatively impacts our operating income due to significant manufacturing  distribution  research and development  and selling expenses incurred outside of the us  while the weaker us dollar positively impacts our revenues generated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
currently  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain non functional currency assets and liabilities 
our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 
we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications 
we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold 
for example  ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gps receiver and data communications products sold in the european union 
an inability to obtain such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
also  some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require an end user to obtain licensing from the federal communications commission fcc for frequency band usage 
these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions 
during the fourth quarter of  the fcc temporarily suspended the issuance of licenses for certain of our real time kinematic products because of interference with certain other users of similar radio frequencies 
an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business 
the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect your investment in our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
during fiscal  our stock price ranged from to 
we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially  including o announcements and rumors of developments related to our business or the industry in which we compete  o quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels  o general conditions in the worldwide economy  including fluctuations in interest rates  o announcements of technological innovations  o new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  o developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation  o developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers  and o any significant acts of terrorism against the united states 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of high tech companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock  and the market price of our common stock may decline 
we may be materially affected by new regulatory requirements 
we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and upcoming requirements relating to the materials composition of many of our products 
the european union eu has adopted two directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment sold in the eu 
the first of these is the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive  which directs eu member states to enact laws  regulations  and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electrical and electronic equipment are financially responsible for specified collection  recycling  treatment and environmentally sound disposal of products placed on the market after august  and from products in use prior to that date that are being replaced 
the eu has also adopted the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive 
the rohs directive restricts the use of lead  mercury and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the market in the european union after july  similar laws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other regions  including in the united states  china and japan 
other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to utilize components which are more environmentally compatible and such reengineering and component substitution may result in additional costs to us 
although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and the effect of such laws  there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations  including the handling and disposal of non hazardous and hazardous wastes  and emissions and discharges into the environment 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action  penalties  or the imposition of other liabilities 
we also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
under certain of these laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating hazardous substances or petroleum products on or from its property  without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or caused  the contamination  as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination 
the presence of  or failure to remediate properly  such substances could adversely affect the value and the ability to transfer or encumber such property 
based on currently available information  although there can be no assurance  we believe that such liabilities will not have a material impact on our business 
provisions in our charter documents and under california law could prevent or delay a change of control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation  as amended and restated  our bylaws  as amended and restated  and the california general corporation law may be deemed to have an anti takeover effect and could discourage a third party from acquiring  or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  control of us without approval of our board of directors 
these provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
certain provisions allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 
we have adopted a preferred shares rights agreement  commonly known as a poison pill 
the provisions described above  our poison pill and provisions of the california general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 
market interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our secured credit facility 
our credit facility is comprised of a three year  us dollar only revolver that expires on june   and a four year term loan that expires on june  borrowings under the credit facility have interest payments based on a floating rate of libor plus a number of basis points tied to a formula based on our leverage ratio 
the revolver matures on june  and has an outstanding principal balance of million  while the term loan matures on june  and has an outstanding principal balance of million  as of december  all in us currency only 
the three month libor effective rate at december  was 
a hypothetical increase in three month libor rates could result in approximately  annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 
we have hedged the market risk with an interest rate swap on of our term loan 
the rate on that interest rate swap is 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future 
furthermore  the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time 
as a result  actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain trade and inter company receivables and payables  primarily denominated in australian  canadian  new zealand  and swedish currencies  the euro  and the british pound 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts 
these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contract for trading purposes 
foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december  and january  are summarized as follows in thousands december  january  nominal amount fair value nominal amount fair value forward contracts purchased    sold    we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy
