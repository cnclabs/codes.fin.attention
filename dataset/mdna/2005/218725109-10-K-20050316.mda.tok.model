current corillian customers include jp morgan chase  the huntington national bank  wachovia bank and suntrust bank 
substantially all of corillian s revenues are derived from licensing corillian s software and performing professional services for its customers  both through direct sales channels and indirect sales partners 
these professional services include implementation  custom software engineering  consulting  maintenance  training and hosting 
in most cases  corillian recognizes revenues for licenses  implementation  training and custom engineering services using the percentage of completion method 
revenues relating to maintenance and hosting services are recognized ratably over the term of the associated contract 
revenues derived from consulting services are recognized as the services are performed 
corillian generally licenses corillian voyager on an end user basis  with its initial license fee based on a fixed number of end users 
as a customer increases its installed base of end users beyond the initial fixed number of end users  corillian s software license requires the customer to pay corillian an additional license fee to cover additional increments of end users 
revenues from additional seat sales are generally recognized in the period in which the licenses are sold 
the market for new sales of internet banking solutions continued to be challenging in and due to various factors  including conservative information technology spending and budget priorities of financial institutions 
despite these conditions  corillian was able to sign a significant contract in the second quarter of with wachovia bank 
however  most of corillian s license revenues in and came from sales to existing customers 
during these periods  corillian significantly improved its operating performance by increasing sales to existing customers and reducing and controlling operating expenses 
moving forward  corillian will focus on developing additional applications to complement its market position within retail internet banking and selling more products and services to new and existing customers 
revenues for were million  as compared to revenues of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in revenues of million  or  in as compared to  was due primarily to an increase in consolidated maintenance revenues of approximately million in  as compared to  which resulted from an increase in corillian s installed customer base from to the increase in revenues was also due to an increase in hosting revenues of million in  as compared to  primarily related to one significant new hosting customer in the increase in revenues of million  or  in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in software license and professional services revenues of approximately million during  as compared to  including 
table of contents million in sales of additional licenses to existing customers 
the increase in revenues was also due to an increase in maintenance revenues of approximately million in  as compared to  which resulted from an increase in corillian s installed customer base from to during  two customers individually accounted for more than of consolidated revenues  and  in total  these two customers accounted for approximately of consolidated revenues 
during  two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately of consolidated revenues 
during  one customer accounted for approximately of consolidated revenues 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues improved to in  as compared to and in and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues of during  as compared to gross profit as a percentage of revenues during  was mainly due to a change in sales mix 
license  maintenance and hosting revenues  in dollars and as a percentage of revenues  increased during  while professional service revenues  in dollars and as a percentage of revenues  decreased 
there are relatively few costs attributed to license revenues  and there were insignificant incremental costs attributed to the increased maintenance and hosting revenues 
this increase was partially offset by use of corillian s research and development personnel during to provide services for one of corillian s customers  which resulted in corillian classifying approximately million in research and development expenses related to these personnel as cost of revenues 
the related contract was completed during  so corillian does not anticipate similar accounting treatment during the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues of during  as compared to  was mainly due to the increase in sales of additional licenses to existing customers and the million of gross profit recognized during from projects on which corillian used the zero profit methodology for revenue recognition 
this increase was partially offset by use of corillian s research and development personnel during to provide services for one of corillian s customers  which resulted in corillian classifying approximately million in research and development expenses related to these personnel as cost of revenues 
corillian reported net income of million for  as compared to net income of million and net loss of million in and  respectively 
the increase in corillian s net income in  as compared to and  resulted from the increase in revenues and improved gross margins discussed above and corporate cost containment initiatives implemented throughout and corillian s overall financial position strengthened significantly during corillian generated million in net cash from operations during and had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december   as compared to million in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  working capital improved from million as of december  to million as of december  in february  corillian paid off the outstanding balance of debt held with a financial institution 
since incorporation  corillian has incurred substantial costs to develop and market its technology and to provide professional services 
as a result  corillian has accumulated a deficit of approximately million as of december  corillian s limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast future operating results 
as a result of the rapid evolution of corillian s business and limited operating history  corillian believes period to period comparisons of its results of operations  including its revenues and cost of revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues are not necessarily indicative of its future performance 
corillian is in negotiations regarding the potential acquisition of a company that provides products and services related to corillian s business 
the purchase price for the acquisition is currently contemplated to be approximately million  but the final amount has not been established as of the date of this report 
corillian currently anticipates that it would issue corillian stock for most of the purchase price and that it would pay cash for the remainder of the purchase price 
neither corillian nor the potential seller is under any current obligation to proceed with the transaction 
the transaction remains subject to  among other things  completion of due diligence  negotiation of appropriate agreements and obtaining corporate and third party approvals 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon corillian s audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires corillian to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  corillian evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  investments  income taxes  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
corillian bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain of corillian s accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition and accruals for contracts in loss positions 
corillian s policy and related procedures for software revenue recognition are summarized below 
revenue recognition 
corillian recognizes revenues from software licensing agreements in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
corillian s software arrangements generally include software licenses  implementation and custom software engineering services  post contractual customer support  training services and hosting services 
corillian s software licenses are  in general  functionally dependent on implementation  training and certain custom software engineering services  therefore  software licenses and implementation and training services  together with custom software engineering services that are essential to the functionality of the software  are combined and recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
corillian has determined that post contractual customer support and hosting services can be separated from software licenses  implementation  training and custom software engineering services because a post contractual customer support and hosting services are not essential to the functionality of any other element in the arrangement  and b sufficient vendor specific objective evidence exists to permit the allocation of revenue to these service elements 
the hosting element can be accounted for separately from the license element  as the customer can take possession of the software without significant penalty  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
the percentage of completion is measured by the percentage of contract hours incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract hours for each contract 
corillian has the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates relating to the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
profit estimates are subject to revision as the contract progresses towards completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period that the facts giving rise to the revision become known 
corillian reduces the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through various approval and monitoring processes and policies 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative billings at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as deferred revenue or revenue in excess of billings  respectively 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
vendor specific objective evidence has been established on post contractual customer support and hosting services using the renewal rate 
corillian allocates revenue to certain elements in multiple element arrangements using the residual method 
the difference between the total software arrangement fee and the amount deferred for post contractual customer support and hosting services is allocated to software license  implementation  training and custom software engineering services and recognized using contract accounting 

table of contents revenues for post contractual customer support are recognized ratably over the term of the support services period  generally a period of one year 
services provided to customers under customer support and maintenance agreements generally include technical support and unspecified product upgrades deliverable on a when and if available basis 
revenues from hosting services for transactions processed by corillian are recognized ratably over the hosting term 
pursuant to sop no 
 on projects where ultimate recoverability is questionable due to inherent hazards  corillian limits revenue recognition in the period to the amount of project costs incurred in the same period  and postpones recognition of profits until results can be estimated more precisely 
under this zero profit methodology  equal amounts of revenues and costs  measured on the basis of performance during the period  are presented in corillian s consolidated statements of operations 
corillian generally licenses corillian voyager on an end user basis  with its initial license fee based on a fixed number of end users 
as a customer increases its installed base of end users beyond the initial fixed number of end users  corillian s software license agreements require customers to pay corillian an additional license fee to cover additional increments of end users 
revenues from additional license seat sales  less any amounts related to maintenance included in the arrangement  are generally recognized in the period in which the licenses are sold 
in arrangements where corillian does not have an obligation to install its products  but may become involved in the installation of these products  corillian recognizes non refundable license fees over the estimated implementation period for the customer or reseller s project 
if corillian determines that the customer or reseller can successfully install corillian s products in a production environment without corillian s involvement  corillian will recognize non refundable license fees in the period in which collectibility of the license fees is probable  assuming all other sop no 
revenue recognition criteria are met 
in certain arrangements  corillian may defer all revenues and related costs of revenues until delivery is complete and customer acceptance is obtained 
these arrangements have certain elements of risk such as an obligation to deliver new products when technological feasibility has not been obtained at the onset of the arrangement or an obligation to deliver software customized to a customer specifications 
in arrangements where corillian is providing customized functionality on a best efforts basis  corillian generally recognizes revenues as services are performed 
arrangements where customers fund expedited development of software products are accounted for as funded research and development 
in arrangements where corillian retains and reserves title and all ownership rights to the software products  corillian recognizes these funds as a reduction of research and development expense 
income taxes 
corillian has established a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  including those for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
such a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this determination was based on an evaluation of positive and negative factors including our net loss position for the three year period ended december   future projections and limitations on the use of net operating losses 
the valuation allowance at december  and was million and million  respectively 
corillian will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in future reporting periods

until corillian s resellers are successful at distributing and implementing corillian s products internationally  corillian does not anticipate that revenues from international operations will comprise a significant percentage of its consolidated revenues 
revenues increased from million for to million for this increase in revenues of million  or  was primarily due to an increase in consolidated software license and professional service revenues of approximately million during  as compared with this increase was also partially due to an increase of million in sales of additional licenses to existing customers during  as compared with the majority of the revenues from these additional license sales were recognized in the period in which the licenses were sold 
the increase in revenues during was also due to an increase in maintenance revenues of approximately million  as compared with  as corillian s installed customer base increased from to due to certain triggering events included in a customer s contract  beginning with the three month period ended september   corillian applied the zero profit methodology discussed above to three existing projects for one customer 
both revenue and expense recognized from these projects accounted for under the 
table of contents zero profit methodology during and  was approximately  and  respectively 
as all three of this customer s projects were completed and accepted during  corillian recognized an additional million of revenues related to these projects  which had been previously deferred until completion of the projects  during since all cost of revenues associated with these projects had been previously recognized using the zero profit methodology  recognition of this deferred revenue resulted in the corresponding recognition of million in gross profit during no further revenues were deferred on these projects as of december  corillian s international operations contributed approximately  to corillian s consolidated revenues in  as compared with  to corillian s consolidated revenues in corillian services  inc contributed  to corillian s consolidated revenues for  as compared with approximately million to corillian s consolidated revenues for corillian services  inc was eliminated as a separate entity at the end of  therefore  corillian does not anticipate generating revenues in the future from corillian services  inc as of december   corillian had a backlog of unfilled orders of million  as compared to a backlog of million as of december  backlog decreased during  as revenues recognized were greater than bookings during this period 
backlog represents contractual customer commitments  including fees for licenses  professional services  maintenance  hosting and subscriptions 
backlog is not necessarily indicative of revenues to be recognized in any given future period 
there are many factors that could impact corillian s filling of backlog  such as corillian s progress in completing projects for its customers and corillian s customers meeting anticipated schedules for customer dependent deliverables 
corillian provides no assurances that any portion of its backlog will be filled during any fiscal year or at all or that its backlog will be recognized as revenues in any given period 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for professional service personnel and outsourced professional service providers who are responsible for the implementation and customization of corillian s software and for maintenance and support personnel who are responsible for post contractual customer support 
cost of revenues decreased from million in  to million in gross profit increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues during  as compared to  was mainly due to a higher percentage of license  maintenance and hosting revenues 
license  maintenance and hosting revenues  in dollars and as a percentage of revenues  increased during  while professional service revenues  in dollars and as a percentage of revenues decreased 
there are relatively few costs attributed to license revenues  and there were insignificant incremental costs attributed to the increased maintenance and hosting revenues 
the decrease in cost of revenue was partially offset by million of expenses  related to research and development personnel providing services for one of corillian s customers being classified as cost of revenues during corillian does not anticipate similar use of research and development personnel to provide services to our customers in  as this project was substantially completed during cost of revenues remained essentially flat from approximately million in  to million in gross profit increased as a percentage of revenues from in  to in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues during  as compared to  was mainly due to the increase of million in sales of additional licenses to existing customers and the million of gross profit recognized during from projects on which corillian had used the zero profit methodology for revenue recognition 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was also partially attributable to improved margins on hosting services and post contractual customer support 
this increase was partially offset by use of corillian s research and development personnel during to provide services for one of corillian s customers  which resulted in corillian classifying approximately million in research and development expenses related to these personnel as cost of revenues 

table of contents operating expenses sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions  and related expenses for personnel involved in marketing  sales and support functions  as well as costs associated with trade shows and other promotional activities 
sales and marketing expense increased from million for to million for this increase of  or  was mainly due to the number of personnel in marketing increasing from at the end of to at the end of sales and marketing expenses also increased due to commissions and consulting expenses increasing approximately  and  respectively  during corillian expects sales and marketing expenses to increase during due to additional investment surrounding additional product lines as well as increased commissions

the decrease would have been larger if not for the impact of approximately  of funded research and development recorded as a reduction of research and development expense during the three month period ended march  research and development expenses  to a certain extent  could fluctuate in future periods due to the additional funding of corillian s research and development activities by customers accounted for under the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange rate sensitivity corillian develops products in the united states and markets its products and services in the united states  and to a lesser extent in europe  asia and australia 
as a result  its financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets
