item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we develop  manufacture  market and sell intuitive interface devices and components for a variety of business and home applications 
we generate revenues from the sale of our hardware products  including interactive remote input devices  pen input pads and integrated cursor control devices 
to a lesser extent  we derive revenue from the sale of software combined with our hardware 
depending on the application  this software may be internally developed or purchased from software partners 
we record our revenue in four market segments business communications wireless intuitive input device products addressing the presentation market  home entertainment wireless intuitive input device and sensor products addressing the advanced viewing devices  e transactions input devices for the electronic signature markets  and specialty components integrated fsr based sensors  subassemblies and modules that support cursor control and other input functions 
we have addressed our specialty components market since our inception in our other three markets have evolved out of our specialty components market 
we have addressed our business communications market as a separate market since  our e transactions market since and our home entertainment market since the relative revenue and gross profit contributions of each of these segments is provided below in results of operations business segment overview 
overview in we achieved steady revenue growth in each of our market segments 
business communications grew based on a growth in oem sales 
branded product sales in this segment were less in than in because of our decision to stop selling to consumer retail channels but experienced sequential quarterly growth in each quarter of as a result of increased sales to distributors and value added resellers 
home entertainment experienced a growth in revenue as we recorded significant sales to manufacturers of advanced viewing devices and continued sales of sensors to microsoft for its xbox game controller 
e transaction sales grew by as we continued to expand our customer base and to move out of the market education and early adopter phase of our marketing plan 
specialty components  traditionally a reliable but flat contributor to revenues  grew in based largely on the introduction of our micronav family of sensor products and their incorporation into new oem product designs 
while revenues have grown nicely across the entire range of our markets  earnings were more of a challenge in and we recorded a loss from operations of million in  compared to a profit of million in a number of factors contributed to our loss  including the following we experienced substantial startup costs related to the introduction of new products and the expansion of our manufacturing operation in china 
our success in expanding our markets and product offerings resulted in the introduction of several new products in  including our micronav family of sensors and remote devices for the home entertainment market 
we experienced relatively high production costs in these areas in the initial production stage 
we also incurred significant costs in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing capability in china 
these costs contributed to an overall lowering of our gross margin for the period 

table of contents we continue to experience margin pressures in sales of our remote interface devices as the market becomes more consumer oriented 
we sell remote interface devices in our business communications and home entertainment markets 
the business communications market is becoming more consumer oriented as projector prices fall to levels at which there is a consumer market for them 
the advanced viewing device market is  by its nature  a consumer market 
consumer markets are characterized by high volumes and intense price competition 
primarily as a result of these factors and the startup costs described above  gross profit percentage decreased from in to in we expect to continue to experience margin pressure in these areas and are actively responding to this challenge 
we experienced unprecedented general and administrative costs for sarbanes oxley section compliance 
in  we recorded  of expense of total revenue  consisting of the fees of our auditors relating solely to their audit of our accounting controls and of consultants that we retained to assist us with those controls 
the total cost of implementing and testing changes in our accounting control system included  in addition to these direct  outside costs  substantial amounts of time contributed by our staff at all levels and in all departments 
largely as a result of these costs and other sales  marketing and administrative costs totaling approximately million commensurate with revenue growth  total selling  general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in in september  we completed a public stock offering which made a contribution of million to our capital  net of offering costs 
combined with million in proceeds from option exercises  this capital infusion strengthened our balance sheet and put us in a strong position to support future growth 
the public offering was structured as a take down from a shelf registration statement that remains effective and permits us to access public capital markets on relatively short notice should the need or opportunity arise 
we continue to maintain commercial credit facilities  although we have no outstanding balance under our principal credit facility and have continued to pay down existing long term debt 
in  we incurred capital expenditures of million to support anticipated growth in our business 
outlook we expect that the growth trends in each of our market areas will continue in in business communications  we expect presentation projector unit sales to experience strong growth as the industry continues to move away from conference room and fixed installation projectors to ultra portable units or value priced projectors 
however we expect declines in average sales prices of projectors to place continued price pressure on projector vendors that may impact the percentage of total presentation projector sales that include an advanced wireless input device and to place continued pressure on margins 
accordingly  we expect growth in revenue from sales of presentation projector input devices at a more modest rate than the growth in unit projector sales 
we expect continued growth in our branded sales as we continue to develop our sales channels 
we also expect branded revenue growth from the introduction of additional products in this market  such as our recently introduced gospeak voice amplification system 

table of contents in our home entertainment market  we expect to continue to expand our customer base as more companies enter the advanced viewing device market and require advanced input devices 
additionally  we expect sales to grow consistent with growth in sales of the advanced viewing devices 
as noted above  wireless input devices supporting consumer electronics products command lower margins than to our sensor or pen input products 
accordingly  we expect that growth in this market will have a significant impact on revenue and a somewhat more modest impact on earnings 
we expect continued growth in our e transactions market as more companies make decisions to automate their document process 
in addition to growth in unit sales  we expect to achieve revenue growth as a result of functionality enhancements  such as our integrisign electronic signature software suite  that we are able to offer with our epad product as a part of a total solution package 
our specialty products market is poised to experience potentially strong growth based on our micronav sensor products 
saw our initial design wins and we anticipate that we will continue to be incorporated in new handheld products as our oem customers complete their design cycles 
as noted above  we experienced substantial increases in selling  general and administrative costs in as a result of new and complex financial control requirements and associated audit costs 
much of the increase related to the implementation of new financial control systems that are now in place 
accordingly  while we expect that financial and accounting costs will exceed historical averages for the foreseeable future  we do not expect these costs to reach levels in current opportunities and challenges a considerable portion of our effort is directed at emerging markets where our success depends on our ability accurately to forecast the nature  amount and timing of market requirements in an environment in which historical precedent is limited or non existent 
we rely on information generated by our internal staff and industry partners and on independent market studies for forecasts of market demand in our focus areas  but these studies are themselves based on limited empirical data 
an inaccurate forecast of market demand in any of our core market areas would impact our short term performance and could impact our competitive position and  therefore  our long term performance 
our quarterly results are often affected by volatility in orders for a particular product 
our oem sales depend on sales levels of the products that our products support 
they also vary with the life cycle of a particular product 
for example  for the last quarters  we have sold a significant number of sensors to microsoft for use in its xbox game controller 
microsoft is replacing that product with one that does not have the functionality that requires our sensor 
accordingly  we expect sales of these sensors to end in the third or fourth quarter of similarly  sales to large customers may come in relatively large orders that can be one time events or can occur at widely dispersed intervals 
management faces the constant challenge of balancing its investment in new technology  product development and marketing initiatives against the objective of steady earnings growth 
a decision to make a significant investment in a new technology  product or marketing effort may have a short to medium term negative impact on earnings even if the investment proves to be justified 
because we intend to pursue a growth strategy  it is probable that we will make investments in new business opportunities that will increase operating costs  decrease margins and negatively impact earnings until the investment produces significant revenue growth

 revenues gross profit net income loss earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share diluted as restated 
quarterly revenues have increased by on a cumulative basis since march sequential growth occurred in each quarter except the first two quarters of  which followed a quarter of exceptional revenue growth 
gross profits have generally trended with revenues except in the fourth quarter of when we recorded a material write off of obsolete inventory and in the third and fourth quarters of when we experienced higher material costs due to the ramp up of remote control sales for our home entertainment market segment 
earnings generally trended upward in and  with the exception of the fourth quarter of  as a result of growth in revenues and tight cost controls 
they have trended down in despite continued strong revenue growth  primarily as a result of a higher percentage of total revenues being derived from sales of wireless input devices on which we earn lower margins and substantially increased selling  general and administrative expense in the last half of the year as we incurred financial and accounting costs required by new legislation 

table of contents on march   we reported the restatement of our financial statements for the first three quarters of the following table presents certain financial information for each of these quarters as originally stated in our reports on form q  the adjustments subsequently made and the information as restated as originally reported restatement adjustment as restated in thousands except per share data st quarter revenues gross profit net income loss earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share diluted nd quarter revenues gross profit net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted rd quarter revenues gross profit net income loss earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share diluted the restatements are due to an error in interpreting the sec revenue recognition guidelines regarding a bill and hold product sale in the first quarter of the resulting restatements decreased revenues in the first quarter of by  and increased revenues by  and  in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
gross profit and net income were reduced in the first quarter of by  and increased by  and  in the second and third quarters  respectively 
also  in the third quarter of our product costing system underestimated the ramp up costs and low yields of the start up of our high volume home entertainment remote control business and overstated inventory and the amount of manufacturing overhead allocable to inventory 
the resulting restatement increased cost of sales and decreased inventory by million in the third quarter of internal control material weaknesses were identified related to these restatements and are discussed in item a controls and procedures in this report 

table of contents results of operations business segment overview revenue and gross profit by market segment are shown in the following table market segment s percent of total sales s percent of total sales s percent of total sales business communications revenue gross profit gross profit of segment revenue home entertainment revenue gross profit gross profit of segment revenue e transactions revenue gross profit gross profit of segment revenue specialty components revenue gross profit gross profit of segment revenue all segments revenue gross profit gross profit of segment revenue year ended december  compared with year ended december  business communications in our business communications segment  we sell wireless remote controls on an oem basis to the leading manufacturers of presentation projectors 
we also sell interlink branded wireless remote controls and keyboards direct to computer products retailers  corporate resellers and distributors 
in  oem revenues comprised approximately of business communications revenues as compared to in 
table of contents overall  business communication revenues grew 
oem revenues grew  reflecting an approximate growth in units coupled with an approximate decline in average selling prices 
in  oem average selling prices ranged from revenues from branded products  which had average selling prices of approximately  declined from million in to million in as a result of our decision to stop selling to consumer retail channels 
however  branded sales experienced sequential growth in each quarter of business communication gross margin in was compared to in reflecting the greater mix of oem business in home entertainment in our home entertainment segment  we sell remote controls on an oem basis to manufacturers of advanced viewing devices including projectors sold for tv viewing and fsr sensors to microsoft for integration into their xbox game controller 
home entertainment revenues grew as compared to  reflecting initial sales in quantity of remote controls for advanced tv viewing devices and continued sales of sensors for microsoft s xbox controller 
we expect xbox related sales to end in the last half of the current year 
home entertainment gross margin declined to in from in due to lower margins associated with high volume remote sales and startup costs associated with these new programs 
e transactions in our e transactions segment  we sell electronic signature capture devices and  depending on the customer requirement  signature capture software 
e transaction revenues increased over due to greater industry adoption of the e pad product line and thus a broadening of our client base in this market 
e transaction gross margin remained relatively unchanged at for as compared to in specialty components our specialty components segment  we sell custom fsrs and fsr based subassemblies to many customers in several vertical markets  such as medical devices  industrial input and military input products 
in we have significantly expanded the market opportunity reflected by this market by developing our micronav family of sensors which address applications in the rapidly growing handheld consumer electronics product market 
specialty components revenues increased in as compared to due to sales of micronav sensors to initial customers in the mp player and cellular telephone markets 
specialty component gross margin declined to in from in due to the relatively lower margin associated with the micronav products approximately as compared to our historical specialty components product margins and startup costs associated with this new program 

table of contents because of the development of our micronav sensors  specialty components has become a marketing focal point 
we are aggressively pursuing several opportunities to incorporate our sensors in various consumer electronic products 
design cycles for these products are typically long and new business in this market may develop slowly 
because of our limited experience to date with these sensors  we are unable to predict the rate at which new business may develop or the margins that will apply to any business that does develop 
operating expenses product development and research costs include internal engineering labor  contract engineering and outside processing costs for the design and development of our oem and branded designs and products and the research of our technologies 
for  our product development and research costs increased over due to development of new products in our home entertainment remote  epad and micronav product lines 
as a percentage of revenues  product development and research costs increased to in as compared to in we expect that product development and research costs will continue to exceed of revenues for the foreseeable future 
sales  general and administrative costs sg a include sales  marketing  accounting and administrative labor  sales commissions  advertising  general marketing  branded business communications channel marketing and travel and entertainment costs 
for  sg a grew over due to an approximate  in costs associated with the implementation of internal control requirements related to the sarbanes oxley act of and to increased accounting and financial costs and general marketing commensurate with sales growth 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a increased to in versus in although we find it difficult to predict future accounting and financial costs in today s rapidly changing environment  we expect sg a to decline as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
in summary  our operating results in were attributable to the following factors growth in revenues that occurred primarily in our business communications  home entertainment and e transactions sectors  a decline in overall gross margins as a result of increased high volume sales of remote products  and a high ratio of startup costs associated with these new programs  and a substantial increase in sg a cost attributable to new financial and accounting requirements 
total other income improved to  in as compared to  in due to lower debt levels partially and interest income from the investment of the proceeds of our stock offering 
we have million in net operating loss nol carryforwards for us federal tax purposes 
in and  for accounting purposes  we recognized some of those nols as an accrued tax benefit 
however  because of our subsequent losses in and  in the fourth quarter of we recorded a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets 
this non cash charge reduced the net value of the deferred tax assets on the balance sheet to zero 
current accounting standards place significant weight on a history of recent cumulative losses in determining whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary 
forecasts of future taxable income are not considered sufficient positive evidence to outweigh a history of losses 
accordingly  the assets were reserved in full 
our federal nol carryforwards are not impacted and can continue to be utilized for up to years 
we have maintained the full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of december  
table of contents section section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  places a limitation on the realizability of nols in future periods if the ownership of the company has changed more than within a three year period 
under section  we have experienced an approximate change in ownership for the three year period ended december  as of december   none of our nols have been limited by the section rules 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  business communications in  oem revenues comprised approximately of business communications revenues as compared to in overall  business communication revenues grew 
oem revenues grew  reflecting an approximate growth in units coupled with an approximate decline in average selling prices 
in  oem average selling prices ranged from revenues from branded products  which had average selling prices of approximately before special price reductions grew 
the growth in oem units is consistent with the growth in the presentation projector market 
the oem average selling price decline is reflective of competitive price pressure affecting the industry as a whole 
the branded unit volume increase results from our efforts to expand our channel customer base and broaden our product line 
business communication gross margin in was compared to in but the gross margin in was reduced by approximately by the inventory write off million recorded in fourth quarter of the decline in gross margin  excluding the impact of inventory write offs  was due to the oem average selling price decline discussed above 
home entertainment revenues related to the xbox program accounted for approximately of our home entertainment revenues in our home entertainment revenues remained relatively flat as compared to  reflecting a slight decline in xbox related revenues and an offsetting improvement in sales of remote controls for advanced tv viewing devices 
home entertainment gross margin improved to in from in due to increased sales of higher margin remote controls for advanced tv viewing devices 
e transactions our e transaction revenues increased over due to greater industry adoption of the e pad product line and a large sale to a major us bank recorded in fourth quarter of e transaction gross profit as a percentage of sales remained relatively consistent with we expect e transaction gross profit margins to remain relatively the same in 
table of contents specialty components specialty components revenues were down in as compared to due to greater competition in the industrial input market 
specialty component gross margin improved to in as compared to in due to the lower amount of relatively lower margin industrial input sales in operating expenses for  our product development and research costs increased over due to development of new products in our branded business communication and e transaction segments 
as a percentage of revenues  product development and research costs declined to in from in due to sales growth leverage 
however  we expect that product development and research costs will continue to exceed of revenues for the foreseeable future 
for  sg a grew over due to increased branded business communication channel marketing costs and increased sales commissions and general marketing commensurate with sales growth 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a declined to in versus in due to sales growth leverage 
in summary  our improved operating results in were attributable to the following factors growth in revenues that occurred in our business communications and e transactions sectors  the inventory write off in that did not occur in  and growth in operating expenses supporting the growth in revenues 
total other income expense improved to a positive  in versus a negative  in due to lower interest expense as a result of lower debt levels partially offset by lower interest income from lower invested cash levels 
liquidity and capital resources our capital resources have historically come from sales of equity securities and commercial borrowing 
at times since  operations have been a net generator of cash 
our principal historical cash requirements have been to fund new product and technology development  to support sales  marketing  inventory and accounts receivable costs and to fund losses in loss periods 
while we expect continuing operations to generate cash  we anticipate that additional capital resources will be required to support future growth and expect to rely on existing cash balances and sales of securities and commercial financing to provide the required resources 
to some extent  we expect that our rate of growth will be within our control and  accordingly  we expect to adjust our growth commitments to reflect the availability and attractiveness of financing arrangements and non growth related cash requirements 
in september  we completed a public stock offering which made a net contribution of million to our capital 
we also received million in proceeds from option exercises 
principally as a result of these events  our cash and cash equivalents increased from million at the end of to million at the end of we believe that we are adequately funded to support continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
cash flow comes principally from collection of accounts receivable and  to a lesser extent  from interest or other return on financial investments 
we maintain what we believe to be appropriate reserves 
table of contents for doubtful accounts and are not aware of any prospective development that would impact collections differently from our historical experience 
it is industry practice to allow payment terms of greater than days generally days for our branded products and asian customer base 
in  sales to customers with terms greater than days were of our overall sales  as compared to in to the extent our growth in these areas continues to increase as a percentage of total revenues  our average days to collect on our accounts receivable will increase and this would slow down our average cash collections 
on two occasions  we have made substantial inventory reserve adjustments that reflect management s judgment as to the recoverable value of inventory 
we do not currently anticipate the need for a further inventory adjustment but any significant diminution in inventory value would ultimately affect cash flow 
we have million of credit availability under our us bank line of credit  none of which was used as of december  the availability of this credit is subject to various conditions and to our continuing compliance with certain covenants 
as of december   we were in violation of one of these covenants  for which we received a waiver from the bank 
working capital increased from million at the end of to million at december  and to million at december  the increase in reflects improved results during the period and proceeds from the exercise of employee and management stock options 
the increase in resulted primarily from our stock offering and additional option exercises 
except for the credit facilities described above  we have no commitments with respect to future capital resources 
operations used cash of million in  and million in the improvement was due primarily to lowered accounts receivable balances 
the primary uses of cash in were investments in working capital accounts receivable and inventory designed to facilitate our further penetration of the business communications branded channel  partially offset by the managed extension of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the decrease in the use of cash in was due primarily to improved accounts receivable balances 
we spent  in and  in to purchase additional manufacturing and computer equipment 
we made payments on long term debt of  and  in and  respectively 
net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stockholder loan repayments were million and million in and  respectively 
contractual obligations we currently have modest commitments for capital expenditures and no material purchase obligations 
our long term debt and operating lease obligations as of december  are set forth in the following table total less than year years th year long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total these amounts may increase as we pursue our growth strategy but the amount of any such growth will depend on the particular requirements of any growth commitment  the availability and attractiveness of equity capital arrangements and our general liquidity position 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to the valuation of inventory and the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and require management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
to satisfy the criteria  we input orders based upon receipt of a customer purchase order  record revenue upon shipment of goods and when risk of loss and title has transferred  confirm pricing through the customer purchase order  and validate creditworthiness through past payment history  credit agency reports and other financial data 
other than through warranty rights  our customers do not have explicit or implicit rights of return 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine the revenue recognition criteria are not met for certain future transactions  such as a determination that collectibility was not reasonably assured  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable are unsecured  and we are at risk to the extent such amounts become uncollectible 
we continually monitor individual account receivable balances  and provide for an allowance of doubtful accounts at the time collection may become questionable based on payment performance or age of the receivable and other factors related to the customer s ability to pay 
we generally offer day payment terms 
however  some of our distributors in the business communications branded market and some of our japanese oem customers require as long as day payment terms 
we recorded an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts of  for  and a decrease to the allowance of  and  in and  respectively 
write offs against the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
inventory reserve 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of forecast sales levels by product and historical demand 
we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our cost or market value and result in a new cost basis in such inventory until sold 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write down may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
provision for income tax 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  as required 
table of contents by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation reserve 
to the extent we establish a reserve or increase this reserve in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax asset and liabilities and any valuation reserve recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
management continually evaluates its deferred tax asset as to whether it is likely that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we first achieved profitable operations in because of nol carryforwards available both for our us based and japan based operations  we did not accrue income tax expense until in that year  due to the expiration or full utilization of nol carryforwards in california and japan  we began to record a provision for income tax expense in those jurisdictions 
by the end of  we also began to accrue an income tax benefit related to our federal nol carryforwards to be used in future periods 
however  in mid  we began to record quarterly tax losses and suspended any further recognition of nol carryforward tax benefits 
in the fourth quarter of and for the and years  based on historical and prospective evidence  we concluded that we did not have sufficient evidence to be able to recognize our nol carryforward benefits as assets and thus we recognized a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset balance 
as of december   the company had nol carryforwards for federal  state and foreign income tax purposes of million  million and million  respectively  which are available to offset future taxable income in those jurisdictions through foreign exchange exposure 
we have established relationships with most of the major oems in the business communications market 
many of these oems are based in japan and approximately and of our revenues for and  respectively  came from japanese customers 
revenues from these customers are denominated in japanese yen and as a result we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge this exposure 
we use revenue forecasts from our japanese subsidiary to determine the amount of our forward contracts to purchase and we attempt to enter into these contracts when we believe the yen value is relatively strong against the us dollar 
to the extent that our revenue forecast may be inaccurate or the timing of forecasting the yen s strength is wrong  our actual hedge gains or losses may not necessarily correlate with the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on our revenues 
we mark these contracts to market value and the gain or loss from these contracts is recorded in business communications revenue 
these hedge transactions are classified as economic hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in addition  because our japanese subsidiary s functional currency is the yen  the translation of the net assets of that subsidiary into the consolidated results will fluctuate with the yen dollar exchange rate 

table of contents the following table illustrates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our yen denominated revenues and the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activity in thousands 
increase decrease in revenues resulting from foreign currency fluctuations hedging gains losses net revenue impact we calculate the increase decrease in revenues resulting from foreign currency fluctuations by calculating the us dollar equivalent of our yen denominated revenues for the year using the yen dollar exchange rate at the beginning of the year 
the resulting product is compared to our yen denominated revenues converted to us dollars according to gaap and the difference is shown in the table above 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of apb opinion no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies the language used in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
with respect to accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs and spoilage 
the guidance does not result in substantive changes in accounting for these costs but eliminates inconsistencies in wording between us and international accounting standards 
as such  this pronouncement is not expected to have any material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service  the requisite service period usually the vesting period  in exchange for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the company is currently assessing the impact of this accounting standard on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  apb opinion no 
required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of issuance 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results or operations or financial position 

table of contents in october  the american jobs creation act of act became effective in the us two provisions of the act may impact the company s provision benefit for income taxes in future periods  namely those related to the qualified production activities deduction qpa and foreign earnings repatriation fer 
the qpa will be effective for the company s us federal tax return year beginning after december  in summary  the act provides for a percentage deduction of earnings from qualified production activities  as defined  commencing with an initial deduction of three percent for tax years beginning in and increasing to nine percent for tax years beginning after  with the result that the statutory federal tax rate currently applicable to the company s qualified production activities of percent could be reduced initially to percent and ultimately to percent 
however  the act also provides for the phased elimination of the extraterritorial income exclusion provisions of the internal revenue code 
due to the interaction of the law provisions noted above as well as the particulars of the company s tax position  the ultimate effect of the qpa on the company future provision benefit for income taxes has not been determined at this time 
the fasb issued fasb staff position fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp  in december fsp required that tax benefits resulting from the qpa should be recognized no earlier than the year in which they are reported in the entity s tax return  and that there is to be no revaluation of recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities as would be the case had there been a change in an applicable statutory rate 
the fer provision of the act provides generally for a one time percent dividends received deduction for qualifying repatriations of foreign earnings to the us qualified repatriated funds must be reinvested in the us in certain qualifying activities and expenditures  as defined by the act
