item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 
the company is a national pharmaceutical services company providing drug distribution and related healthcare services and solutions to its customers 
the company also provides pharmaceuticals to long term care and workers compensation patients 
the company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers  and substantially all of its operations are located in the united states 
the company s operations are comprised of two reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica 
pharmaceutical distribution the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment includes the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc and the amerisourcebergen specialty and packaging groups 
the operations of the former amerisourcebergen technology group became a part of the overall abdc operations in fiscal the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg 
the abdc operating segment includes the operations of the amerisourcebergen packaging group 
servicing both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel  the pharmaceutical distribution segment s operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes throughout the united states and puerto rico 
the drug distribution operations of abdc and absg comprised over of the segment s operating revenue and over of the segment s operating income in fiscal abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals  over the counter healthcare products  and home healthcare supplies and equipment to a wide variety of healthcare providers  including acute care hospitals and health systems  independent and chain retail pharmacies  mail order facilities  physicians  clinics and other alternate site facilities 
abdc is in a business model transition with respect to how manufacturers compensate us for our services 
historically  supplier arrangements allowed us to generate gross profit in several ways  including cash discounts for prompt payments  inventory buying opportunities  rebates  inventory management and other agreements  vendor program arrangements  negotiated deals and other promotional opportunities 
a significant portion of abdc s gross margin had been derived from our ability to purchase merchandise inventories in advance of pharmaceutical price increases and then hold these inventories until pharmaceutical prices increase  thereby generating a larger gross margin upon sale of the inventories 
over the last two years  pharmaceutical manufacturers have been increasing their control over the pharmaceutical supply channel by using product allocation methods  including the imposition of inventory management agreements imas 
under a typical ima arrangement  the company is compensated based on specific contract defined formulas for maintaining a certain level of inventory for a pre defined period prior to  as of  or subsequent to the date of a manufacturer price increase 
the payment is triggered upon the manufacturer price increase and is recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold over the longer of the product sell through period or post price increase monitoring period 
because the payment trigger is the date of the manufacturer price increase and the size of the payment is typically dependent on the percentage price increase  changes in manufacturers pricing patterns can cause significant volatility to the company s periodic earnings 
additionally  pharmaceutical manufacturers imposed restrictions on our ability to purchase their products from alternate sources and have been requesting more product and distribution sales data from us 
effective october   the company voluntarily made a decision to purchase all pharmaceuticals only from manufacturers in an effort to further protect the integrity of the supply channel 
all of the above has led to significant volatility in abdc s gross margin and  therefore  we are continuing our efforts to shift our pharmaceutical distribution business to a fee for service model where we are compensated for the services we provide manufacturers versus one that is dependent upon manufacturer price increases as is the case with the ima model 
we continue to work with our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners to define fee for service terms that will adequately compensate us for our services  such as our distribution services  inventory management  service level management  and other services 
under a typical fee for service agreement  the company is compensated for its services based on a percentage of purchases over a defined time period 
amounts due for services rendered in the current period would typically be earned in the following month as a reduction of cost of goods sold as the related product is sold 
as of september   we have signed agreements with a number of the 
table of contents large branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that we consider fee for service arrangements as well as some that we consider hybrid agreements with some attributes of imas and some attributes of fee for service arrangements 
we believe the transition to a fee for service model will improve the efficiency of the supply channel and may establish a more predictable earnings pattern for abdc  while expanding our service relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
the fee for service arrangements may establish a more predictable earnings pattern because under many of the agreements the company earns a fee for its services performed on a monthly basis in contrast to the ima model where earnings are largely predicated upon the timing and amount of pharmaceutical price increases 
we continue to have discussions with pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding fee for service arrangements and expect to have agreements in place with a substantial majority of the large branded manufacturers by the end of calendar during fiscal  we expect that more than of abdc s brand name manufacturer gross margin will not be contingent on manufacturer price increases 
the business model transition has had the effect of reducing merchandise inventories because ima and fee for service agreements both limit the amount of inventory we can carry and  as a result  we have experienced a significant increase in cash flow from operations 
the majority of the reduction in merchandise inventories has been realized as of september  as days held in inventory have decreased from days during the fourth quarter of fiscal to days during the fourth quarter of fiscal to days during the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we would expect merchandise inventories to stabilize as the large majority of branded manufacturers are expected to be under some form of fee for service contract and  as a result  we would expect future cash flow from operations to track more closely to net income 
abdc also provides scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment  medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers 
absg  through a number of individual operating businesses  provides distribution and other services  including group purchasing services  to physicians and alternate care providers who specialize in a variety of disease states  including oncology  nephrology  and rheumatology 
absg also distributes vaccines  other injectables  plasma and other blood products 
in addition  through its manufacturer services and physician and patient services businesses  absg provides a number of commercialization  third party logistics  and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers  reimbursement consulting  practice management  and physician education 
absg s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals  including oncology drugs 
the reimbursement changes that have been implemented by the us department of health and human services hhs pursuant to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of medicare modernization act  and that are scheduled to be implemented in the future  may have the effect of reducing the amount and or margins of medications purchased by physicians for administration in their offices and may force patients to other healthcare providers 
since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians  patient shifts from physicians to other healthcare providers may result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for absg 
although absg has contingency plans to enable it to retain and grow the business it conducts with and through physicians  there can be no assurance that it will retain or replace all of the revenue currently going through the physician channel or that such revenue will be as profitable 
the amerisourcebergen packaging group consists of american health packaging and anderson packaging anderson 
american health packaging delivers unit dose  punch card  unit of use and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers 
anderson is a leading provider of contracted packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers 

table of contents pharmerica the pharmerica segment includes the operations of the pharmerica long term care business long term care and a workers compensation related business workers compensation 
the pharmerica reportable segment encompasses only the pharmerica operating segment 
long term care is a leading national provider of pharmacy products and services to patients in long term care and alternate site settings  including skilled nursing facilities  assisted living facilities and residential living communities 
long term care s institutional pharmacy business involves the purchase of bulk quantities of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals  principally from our pharmaceutical distribution segment  and the distribution of those products to residents in long term care and alternate site facilities 
unlike hospitals  most long term and alternate care facilities do not have onsite pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs  but depend instead on institutional pharmacies  such as long term care  to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication 
long term care pharmacies dispense pharmaceuticals in patient specific packaging in accordance with physician orders 
in addition  long term care provides infusion therapy services and medicare part b products  as well as formulary management and other pharmacy consulting services 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the medicare modernization act may have on the long term care business 
the ongoing implementation of medicare part d including coverage and reimbursement changes associated with the voluntary drug benefit program for seniors could have an adverse effect on the long term care business 
at this time  the future impact of the medicare modernization act on the long term care business cannot be determined 
workers compensation provides mail order and on line pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers compensation programs  and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors 
workers compensation services include home delivery of prescription drugs  medical supplies and equipment and an array of computer software solutions to reduce the payor s administrative costs

table of contents year ended september  compared with year ended september  consolidated results operating revenue  which excludes bulk deliveries  for the fiscal year ended september  increased to billion from billion in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment 
the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses  whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products 
bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the company at the express direction of the customer  and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers warehouse sites or shipments from the supplier to the company for immediate shipment to the customers warehouse sites 
bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september  increased to billion from billion in the prior fiscal year due to an increase in demand from the company s largest bulk customer 
the company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has general inventory risk  physical loss inventory risk  and customer credit risk 
as a result  and in accordance with the emerging issues task force no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues 
due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries  fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins 
however  revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the company s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and payments by the company to its suppliers 
in connection with the transition to a fee for service model  we changed our method of recognizing cash discounts and other related manufacturer incentives  effective october  abdc previously recognized cash discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold when earned  which was primarily upon payment of vendor invoices 
abdc now records cash discounts as a component of inventory cost and recognizes such discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold upon the sale of the inventory 
we believe the change in accounting method provides a more objectively determinable method of recognizing cash discounts and a better matching of inventory cost to revenue  as inventory turnover rates are expected to continue to improve 
we recorded a million charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting net of tax of million in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended september  this million cumulative effect charge reduced diluted earnings per share by for the fiscal year ended september  the accounting change is incorporated in our results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  the change improved earnings from continuing operations in the fiscal year ended september  by approximately million  net of tax  or per diluted share from continuing operations

as a percentage of operating revenue  dsad a in the fiscal year ended september  was  compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the dsad a and the dsad a percentage in the fiscal year ended september  from the prior fiscal year was due to an increase in the pharmaceutical distribution segment dsad a  including bad debt expenses 
total bad debt expense increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from a benefit of million in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in bad debt expense relating to one of the operating companies within the specialty group 
additionally  the prior year s bad debt expense was favorably impacted by million of customer recoveries 
in  the company developed an integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company decided to outsource a significant 
table of contents portion of its information technology activities as part of the integration plan 
the company s plan  as revised  is to have a distribution facility network numbering in the mid s within the next two years and to have successfully completed the outsourcing of such information technology activities by the end of fiscal the plan includes building six new facilities four of which were operational as of september  and closing facilities twenty three of which have been closed through september

segment information pharmaceutical distribution segment results pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue of billion for the fiscal year ended september  increased from billion in the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  the company discontinued servicing the us department of veterans affairs va and advancepcs 
these former customers contributed and  respectively  of the segment s operating revenue in the fiscal year ended september  the lost business was offset by the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical distribution business and the market growth of abdc 
during the fiscal year ended september   of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from sales to retail customers  this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of institutional and retail 
in comparison with the prior year results  sales to institutional customers were flat primarily due to the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical distribution business  offset by the loss of the va and advancepcs business 
sales to retail customers increased over the prior year primarily due to market growth and an increase in sales to one of the company s larger retail customers 
this segment s growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions  including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset  in part  by the increased use of lower priced generics 
the segment s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix 
industry sales in the united states  as estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare  inc  are expected to grow between and in and annually between and through future operating revenue growth will continue to be affected by competition within the industry  customer consolidation  changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices  changes in federal government rules and regulations and industry growth trends  such as the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers 
the company s specialty group has been growing at rates in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth 
the majority of this group s revenue is generated 
table of contents from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  such as oncology  nephrology  and rheumatology 
additionally  the specialty group distributes vaccines and blood plasma 
the specialty group s oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the specialty group s most significant contributor to revenue growth 
the specialty group s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals  including oncology drugs 
the reimbursement changes that have been implemented by hhs pursuant to the medicare modernization act  or that may be proposed or implemented in the future  may have the effect of reducing the amount and or margins of medications purchased by physicians for administration in their offices and may force patients to other healthcare providers 
since the specialty group provides a number of services to or through physicians  patient shifts from physicians to other healthcare providers may result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for the specialty group 
although the specialty group has contingency plans to enable it to retain and grow the business it conducts with and through physicians  there can be no assurance that it will retain or replace all of the revenue currently going through the physician channel or that such revenue will be as profitable 
pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of  million in the fiscal year ended september  reflects a decrease of from  million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  gross profit in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decline in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in the buy side component of the gross margin  including a decline in inventory appreciation profits  fewer alternate source and deal opportunities and the loss of the va business in fiscal contributing to the decline in inventory appreciation profits were lower levels of inventory on hand during the current fiscal year as a result of the business model transition  and fewer than expected manufacturer price increases prior to the national election in november the company s cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences

pharmaceutical distribution operating income of million in the fiscal year ended september  reflects a decrease of from million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating income in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decline from the prior year percentage was primarily due to a reduction in gross profit 
while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios  this did not occur in the fiscal year ended september  and there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future  or that expense ratio reductions  if they should occur  will offset possible declines in gross margins 
pharmerica segment results pharmerica operating revenue of  million for the fiscal year ended september  was flat compared to  million in the prior fiscal year 
pharmerica s operating revenue was impacted by competitive pressures that affected both the long term care and workers compensation businesses and increasing reductions in medicaid reimbursement rates

pharmerica operating income of million for the fiscal year ended september  decreased from million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating income in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decline was due to the aforementioned reduction in the gross profit margin 
while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future  or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible further declines in gross margins 
intersegment eliminations these amounts represent the elimination of the pharmaceutical distribution segment s sales to pharmerica 
abdc is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to pharmerica 
year ended september  compared with year ended september  consolidated results operating revenue  which excludes bulk deliveries  for the fiscal year ended september  increased to billion from billion in the prior fiscal year
