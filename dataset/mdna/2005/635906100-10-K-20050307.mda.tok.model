item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview national healthcare corporation nhc or the company is a leading provider of long term health care services 
we operate or manage long term health care centers with  beds in states and provide other services in two additional states 
these operations are provided by separately funded and maintained subsidiaries 
we provide long term health care services to patients in a variety of settings including long term nursing centers  managed care specialty units  sub acute care units  alzheimer s care units  homecare programs  assisted living centers and independent living centers

summary of goals and areas of focus accrued risk reserves our accrued professional liability reserves  workers compensation reserves and health insurance reserves totaled  at the end of and are a primary area of management focus 
we have set aside restricted cash to fully fund our professional liability and workers compensation reserves 
the tragic fire on september  at the nashville skilled nursing subsidiary increased these liabilities in and and  depending upon future events  may require additional adjustments in the future 
we have settled of the lawsuits filed against the company and will continue to vigorously defend against the allegations in the lawsuits and seek settlements with residents and their families 
we have in the past and are currently undertaking steps to contain these costs 
as to the risks of fire  we will continue retrofitting in all of our owned and leased long term care centers with fire sprinklers where not already equipped 
we estimate the cost of this undertaking will be approximately  of which approximately  has already been spent 
a fire safety consulting firm was engaged in and continues in to evaluate and modify  if necessary  our priority safety procedures 
in addition  we have implemented a comprehensive fire safety training program at all of our centers to include  where feasible  local fire departments 
as to exposure for professional liability claims  we have developed for our centers performance certification criteria to measure and bring focus to the patient care issues most likely to produce professional liability exposure  including in house acquired pressure ulcers  significant weight loss and numbers of falls 
these programs for certification  which are continuing  have already produced measurable improvements in reducing these incidents 
our experience is that achieving goals in these patient care areas improves both patient and employee satisfaction 
furthermore  we are in the process of identifying and restructuring the ownership or management of our higher risk operations and locations to eliminate nhc liability exposure 
as to workers compensation claims  we have implemented programs such as safety boards  safety awards  and tracking systems for days without a lost time accident to bring focus to these risks at all of our locations 
as to health insurance claims  we changed our health plan network provider to obtain better discounts in and we continue to evaluate our health plan design to identify opportunities for improvements and cost savings

nhi lease renewal we lease long term health care centers and three retirement centers from national health investors 
we have an option to renew this lease at fair market value in we are currently in negotiations with nhi regarding the terms of the new lease 
earnings to monitor our earnings  we have developed budgets and management reports to monitor labor  census  and the composition of revenues 
rate increases from medicare and medicaid are expected to be modest in and may be largely offset by cost increases 
we recognize revenues associated with cost report settlements and requests for exceptions to routine cost limitations when the results of final cost report audits are known and when approvals of exception requests are assured 
the three year review period expired in for approximately  of routine cost limit exceptions and provisions 
these exceptions and provisions have been eliminated from the amounts due to third party payors  which are payables to medicare and medicaid intermediaries  and have been recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of however  we have received no additional cash payments during related to these amounts 
these revenue amounts relate primarily to cost reports filed for and and preliminarily processed by the government intermediaries in growth the long term care industry has gone through a long period of financial distress caused by material reductions in government payments for services and dramatic increases in the cost of professional liability insurance 
as a result  we have limited our expansion efforts and used cash generated from operations to repay debt and build liquidity 
in may  we completed construction and opened a new health care facility in franklin  tennessee  which has long term care beds of these beds came from an existing facility and assisted living units 
furthermore  we completed the construction of a long term care bed addition in murfreesboro  tennessee in august in the future  we will apply for certificates of need for additional beds in our own markets and also evaluate the feasibility of expansion into new markets through internal and external growth 
in we continue to develop an active hospice program in selected areas through our partnership with the recently formed caris healthcare and also explore opportunities to expand our home health care services 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
our critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are as follows revenue recognition third party payors approximately   and of our net revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews 
any differences between our estimates of settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized 
for the cost report years and  we have submitted various requests for exceptions to medicare routine cost limitations for reimbursement 
we received preliminary intermediary approval on  of these requests in after settlement of outstanding litigation styled braeuning  et al vs 
national healthcare lp  et al 
we have  in addition  made provisions of approximately  for other various medicare and medicaid issues for current and prior year cost reports 
consistent with our revenue recognition policies  we will record revenues associated with the approved requests and the other various issues when the approvals  including the final cost report audits  are assured 
the three year review period expired in for approximately  of the routine cost limit exceptions and this amount was recorded as revenue in even though we received no cash payments for this revenue in accrued risk reserves we are principally self insured for risks related to employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
our accrued insurance risk reserves primarily represent the accrual for self insured risks associated with employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
the accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims 
our policy with respect to a significant portion of our workers compensation and professional and general liability claims is to use an actuary to support the estimates recorded for incurred but unreported claims 
our health insurance reserve is based on our known claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined by our analysis of historical claims paid 
we reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis 
professional liability is an area of particular concern to us 
the entire long term care industry has seen a dramatic increase in personal injury wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by nursing homes and their employees in providing care to residents 
as of december   we and or our managed centers are defendants in such claims inclusive of years through in addition  two lawsuits are currently pending relative to a tragic september  fire at our nashville llc skilled nursing subsidiary 
this litigation is expected to take several years to complete and additional claims which are as yet unasserted may arise 
it is possible that these claims plus unasserted claims could exceed our reserves  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
we maintain insurance coverage for incidents occurring in all providers owned  leased or managed by us 
the coverages include both primary policies and umbrella policies 
for years and  we maintain insurance coverage through third party insurance companies 
for  we have bought back the insurance policy we had through a third party insurance company and we are liable for any remaining claims 
for  we maintain primary coverage through our own insurance company with excess coverage provided by a third party insurance company 
for  we maintain both primary and excess coverage through our own insurance subsidiary 
in all years  settlements  if any  in excess of insurance policy limits and our own reserves would be expensed by us 
revenue recognition uncertain collections we provide management services to certain long term care facilities and to others we provide accounting and financial services 
we generally charge of net revenues for our management services and a predetermined fixed rate per bed for the accounting and financial services 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues associated with both management services and accounting and financial services on an accrual basis as the services are provided 
however  there are certain of the third parties with which we have contracted to provide services and which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that the service revenue realization is uncertain and our policy is to recognize income only in the period in which the amounts are collected 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
certain of our accounts receivable from private paying patients and certain of our notes receivable are subject to credit losses 
we have attempted to reserve for expected accounts receivable credit losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate 
we continually monitor and evaluate the carrying amount of our notes receivable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and it is possible  however  that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of the receivables changes over time 
we continually review and refine our estimation process to make it as reactive to these changes as possible 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate credit losses on these balances 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
potential recognition of deferred income during  we sold the assets of eight long term health care centers to national health corporation national  our administrative general partner at the time of the sale 
the resulting profit of  was deferred and will be amortized into income beginning with the collection of the note receivable up to  with the balance  of the profit being amortized into income on a straight line basis over the management contract period 
the collection or alternatively  the offset against certain payables to national of up to  of notes receivable would result in the immediate recognition of up to  of pretax net income 
currently  the notes are due december  guarantees we guarantee the debt of managed and other long term health care centers  and the debt of national and the esop 
we recorded a liability in the amount of  related to our guarantee of  of debt of six long term health care centers in florida 
we recorded this liability based upon our estimate of the value of the underlying collateral of the loans 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments to our estimates and liability under these guarantees and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
tax contingencies nhc continually evaluates for tax related contingencies 
contingencies may arise where tax laws may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment 
we believe we have adequate provisions for tax contingencies 
however  because of uncertainty of interpretation by various tax authorities and the possibility that there are issues that have not been recognized by management  we cannot guarantee we have accurately estimated our tax liabilities 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles

approximately   and of our net patient revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
as discussed above in the application of critical accounting policies section  amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
see application of critical accounting policies for discussion of the effects that this revenue concentration and the uncertainties related to such revenues have on our revenue recognition policies 
compared to results for include a increase compared to in net revenues and a increase in net income before income taxes 
as indicated in the tables shown above  our patient revenues for increased  or compared to this increase reflects improved medicaid and private pay rates 
medicare rate improvements in the fourth quarter increased our revenues by approximately  improvements in medicare rates granted through annual updates effective october  and have restored rates to pre october levels 
our patient revenues were also increased by approximately  of medicare and medicaid adjustments from prior years 
our newly opened cool springs health care and assisted living center in franklin  tennessee  net of revenues from beds closed elsewhere  added revenue of approximately other revenues this year increased  or to  other revenues in include management and accounting service fees of   in and insurance services revenue of   in 
the increase in management and accounting service fees is due in part to the recognition in of  including  from national  of fees received in but which had been doubtful of collection in prior years 
during  nhc provided management  accounting and financial services for facilities as compared to facilities during the increase in insurance service revenues is due to increased premiums for professional liability insurance from our wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
the premiums charged are based upon actuarially determined estimates of potential liability 
total costs and expenses for increased  or to  from  in salaries  wages and benefits  the largest operating costs of this service company  increased  or to  from  other operating expenses increased  or to  for compared to  in rent expense decreased  or to  depreciation and amortization increased to  interest costs decreased to  increases in salaries  wages and benefits are due in part to increased numbers of employees due to newly opened long term care beds and increased utilization in therapy and homecare services and to increased bonus and benefit programs compared to the increases in bonus and benefit programs result both from inflationary increases as well as from changes in the benefit programs 
increases in other operating costs and expenses are due in part to increases in the costs of professional liability insurance  workers compensation insurance and health insurance 
newly opened long term care beds and higher utilization of our therapy and homecare services also contributed to the increases 
decreased interest expense is primarily due to our  prepayment of long term debt in december and  in may the weighted average interest rate for our debt increased to in from in our tax provision remained constant at approximately of income before income taxes 
compared to results for include a increase compared to in net revenues and a increase in net income before income taxes 
as indicated in the tables shown above  our patient revenues for increased  or compared to this increase reflects improved medicaid and private pay rates and improved census 
medicare revenues currently earned  however  are still less than in the same period in the previous year 
although medicare rate improvements in the fourth quarter increased our revenues by approximately  this increase is less than the previously announced  reduction in quarterly revenue that began october  our patient revenues were also increased by approximately  of medicare and medicaid adjustments from prior years 
other revenues this year decreased  or to  other revenues in include management and accounting service fees of   in and insurance services revenue of   in 
the decrease in management and accounting service fees is due primarily to the recognition in of  including  from national  of fees received in but which had been doubtful of collection in prior years

increases in other operating costs and expenses are due primarily to increases in the costs of professional liability insurance  workers compensation insurance and health insurance 
higher utilization of our homecare services also contributed to the increases 
decreased interest expense is primarily due to our  prepayment of long term debt in december the weighted average interest rate for our debt increased to in from in our tax provision remained constant at approximately of income before income taxes 
medicare rate changes medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities snf s were cut by approximately effective october  and then increased only by approximately effective october  we estimate that the october changes increased our quarterly revenues by  which is less than the approximately  reduction in quarterly medicare revenue that began in october beginning october   medicare rates to snf s increased approximately 
in addition  the per diem for patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome increased 
with the october  increases  medicare rates paid to snf s are finally greater than the pre october levels as a result of annual updates  market basket corrections and changes in geographical wage indexes 
these snf medicare changes also impact the revenues of the centers which we manage 
our fees to these centers are generally calculated as a percentage of revenues 
the changes effect both the current amounts owed for management fees and the cash available to the centers to pay unpaid management fees from prior years 
our management fee revenues are reported as other revenues on the statements of income 
no additional material changes to medicare reimbursement are expected until the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms refines the current rug iii case mix methodology 
regarding medicare payments for home health care services  effective october   homecare payment rates were decreased by seven percent from the prior year rates and the inflation update scheduled at percent was reduced to a percent increase 
the changes resulted in an overall reduction of percent in payment rates from prior year payment rates for home health care services effective october  including these and other additional medicare changes  our revenues for homecare services were reduced by million in medicare payments for home health care services provided in rural areas increased by effective april  with a slight decrease 
for non rural areas 
this change plus a increase in the number of medicare episodes provided resulted in an increase in our medicare revenues for homecare services of million in liquidity  capital resources and financial condition net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was  as compared to  for cash provided by operating activities for the current year is composed of net income plus depreciation and increases in various accrued current liabilities including accrued risk reserves  offset by increases in accounts receivable partially by and decreases in accrued liabilities including amounts due third party payors which are payables to medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
cash flows decreased significantly in the current year compared to the prior year due primarily to the reduction of the amounts due to third party payors  which are payables to medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
depreciation increased due primarily to the completion of construction and placing in service a healthcare center located in franklin  tennessee and an addition to an existing healthcare center located in murfreesboro  tennessee 
amounts due to third party payors  which are payable to medicare and medicaid intermediaries decreased  due to the recognition of revenue related to the expiration of the review period for routine limit cost exception requests which were originally approved in the increase in other current liabilities and accrued risks reserves accounted for  in and  in of the cash provided by operating activities 
if the risks materialize as expected  which may not be finally known for several years  they will require the use of our restricted cash

the increase in restricted cash is due primarily to the cash reserved for our accrued risk reserves  including professional liability claims  workers compensation claims and health insurance claims  net of cash paid out for those claims 
table of contractual cash obligations our contractual cash obligations for periods subsequent to december  are as follows less than total year years years after years in thousands long term debt     guaranteed debt   obligation to complete construction   obligation to purchase senior secured notes from financial institutions   operating leases    total contractual cash obligations      future cash obligations for interest expense have not been included in the above table

as discussed in the section debt guarantees  the  obligation represents our estimated obligation under a written put option related to senior secured notes between national and the national health corporation leveraged employee stock ownership plan the esop and certain lending institutions 
in addition to the guaranteed debt obligation shown in the table above  we have guaranteed debt obligations of certain other entities totaling approximately  these guarantees are not included in the table above because we do not anticipate material obligations under these commitments 
our current cash on hand  marketable securities  short term notes receivable  operating cash flows  and as needed  our borrowing capacity are expected to be adequate to meet these contractual obligations and to finance our operating requirements  growth and development plans 
we started paying quarterly dividends in the second quarter of and anticipate the continuation of dividend payments as approved quarterly by the board of directors 
guarantees and related third party exposure debt guarantees in addition to our primary debt obligations  which are included in our consolidated financial statements  we have guaranteed the debt obligations of certain other entities 
those guarantees  which are not included as debt obligations in our consolidated financial statements  total  at december  and include  of debt of managed and other long term health care centers and  of debt of national and the esop 
the  of guarantees of debt of managed and other long term health care centers relates to first mortgage debt obligations of three long term health care centers to which we provide management or accounting services 
we have agreed to guarantee these obligations in order to obtain management or accounting services agreements 
for this service  we charge an annual guarantee fee of to of the outstanding principal balance guaranteed  which fee is in addition to our management or accounting services fee 
the  of guarantees of debt of national and the esop relates to senior secured notes held by financial institutions 
the total outstanding balance of national and the esop s obligations under these senior secured notes is  of this obligation   has been included in our debt obligations because we are a direct obligor on this indebtedness 
the remaining  which is not included in our debt obligations because we are not a direct obligor  is due from nhi to national and the esop and ultimately to the financial institutions 
additionally  under the amended terms of these note agreements  the lending institutions have the right to put to us the entire outstanding balance of this debt on march  upon exercise of this put option by the lending institutions  we would be obligated to purchase the then outstanding balance of these senior secured notes  which is estimated to be approximately  as of december   our maximum potential loss related to the aforementioned debt and financial guarantees is  which is the outstanding balance of the guaranteed debt obligations 
we have accrued approximately  for potential losses as a result of our guarantees 
debt cross defaults the  senior secured notes and an additional  senior notes repaid in were borrowed from national 
national obtained its financing through the esop 
as we are a direct obligor on this debt  it has been reported as a liability owed by us to the holders of the debt instruments rather than as a liability owed to national and the esop 
through a guarantee agreement  our  senior secured notes and our  guarantee described above have cross default provisions with other debt of national and the esop 
we currently believe that national and the esop are in compliance with the terms of their debt agreements 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities by the primary beneficiary of such variable interest entities 
nhc has adopted fin effective march  the company is not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entity and  therefore  has not consolidated any additional entities as the result of adoption of fin the company guarantees  of annual lease payments through of individual entities that operate long term health care facilities in florida 
the individual entities  which lease the facilities from nhi and nhr  are each variable interest entities 
the company has also extended a working capital loan outstanding balance of  at september  and has a equity interest in a hospice company formed in  which hospice company is also a variable interest entity 
the company is not the primary beneficiary of any of these variable interest entities 
the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these variable interest entities is the guaranteed lease payments through and the outstanding balance of the working capital loan to the hospice company 
on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
statement amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  that was issued in the amendments made by statement are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the provisions in statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   and as such  the company is unable to assess the impact on the financial statements 
the fasb has issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment 
the new fasb rule requires the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
the scope of statement r includes a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
statement r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement  as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
statement r is applicable as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  impact of inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years 
however  rates paid under the medicare and medicaid programs do not necessarily reflect all inflationary changes and are subject to cuts unrelated to inflationary costs 
therefore  there can be no assurance that future rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases in our labor and other health care service costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have minimal impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
approximately million of our notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
as the interest rates on these notes receivable are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
approximately million of our notes receivable bear interest at variable rates generally at the prime rate plus

because the interest rates of these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
the remaining million of our long term debt and debt serviced by other parties bear interest at variable rates 
because the interest rates of these instruments are variable  a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in a related increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately  we do not currently use any derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate exposure

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the investments in marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
hypothetically  a increase in quoted market prices would result in a related increase in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities of  and a reduction in quoted market prices would result in a related decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities of approximately
