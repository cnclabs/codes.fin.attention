item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revision of consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows our consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows have been revised  pursuant to sfas no 
 from those originally reported for the years ended december  and to separately reflect the results of discontinued operations for properties that have since been sold 
the revision had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets or our statements of stockholders equity 
the revision had no impact on net income or net income per share of common stock for the years ended december  and see the discussions of discontinued operations in the results of operations section below 
cautionary language the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of which reflect management s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations include market valuations of our stock  financial performance and operations of our shopping centers  real estate conditions  execution of shopping center development programs  successful completion of renovations  completion of pending acquisitions  integration of completed acquisitions  changes in the availability of additional acquisitions  changes in local or national economic conditions  acts of terrorism or war and other risks detailed from time to time in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable for our current circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions under different future conditions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  in that they require our most subjective judgments  form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical 
these critical accounting policies include our estimates of useful lives in calculating depreciation expense on our shopping center properties and the ultimate recoverability  or impairment  of each shopping center asset 
if actual useful lives are different from our estimates this could result in changes to the results of our operations 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of our shopping center properties could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the properties that may not be reflected in the properties current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
overview we receive income primarily from rental revenue from shopping center properties  including recoveries from tenants  offset by operating and overhead expenses 
primarily as a result of our acquisition program  including the acquisition of five shopping centers during and the acquisition of center trust described below  the financial data shows increases in total revenue and total expenses from period to period 
during the year ended december   four non strategic assets were sold 
the cash proceeds were used toward the purchase of a shopping center asset and to pay down our revolving credit facility 
during the year ended december   nine non strategic assets were sold 
the cash proceeds were used toward the purchase of two shopping center assets and to pay down our revolving credit facility 
on november   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with center trust  inc  a maryland corporation 
the transaction  which closed january   included interests in shopping centers  two regional malls and two single tenant assets 
the transaction was a stock for stock exchange  including assumption of  of debt  whereby each share of center trust common stock was exchanged for newly issued 
table of contents shares of our common stock 
as a result  we issued  shares of our common stock to center trust stockholders and as of december   we may issue up to  shares of our common stock to limited partners of ct operating partnership  lp upon the exchange of operating partnership units held by them 
we expect that the more significant part of our growth in the next year or two will come from additional acquisitions of properties and rent increases from the lease up and re tenanting initiatives of the assets acquired during results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december total revenue increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december rental revenue  which includes base rent and percentage rent  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenue resulted principally from the acquisition and lease up of the center trust portfolio  the addition of olympia place as an operating property which had been under development in  and was placed into service in january  and the acquisitions of seven other shopping center assets in and recoveries from tenants  which represents reimbursements from tenants for property operating expenses and property taxes  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of the center trust portfolio  the addition of olympia place as an operating property which had been under development in and the acquisitions of seven other shopping center assets in and in addition  recoveries from tenants increased because recoverable expenses increased 
recoveries from tenants were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in recovery percentage compared to the prior year period reflects the impact of the lease up and re leasing of the center trust portfolio 
we expect that the recovery percentage will continue to increase slightly over time due to additional re leasing and as occupancy is increased in the acquired assets 
other income increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from miscellaneous income related to future cash flow participation in a property that was paid off in advance as well as income from the reversal of the remaining balance of a general legal accrual that was established at the time of the center trust acquisition 
property operating expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  property taxes increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in property taxes was primarily the result of the addition of olympia place as an operating property which had been under development in and the acquisitions of other shopping center assets in and depreciation and amortization increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this was primarily due to depreciation on olympia place and expansion space at el camino north which were under development in  amortization of in place lease value as well as depreciation on properties acquired in and interest expense increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase was partially the result of the debt we assumed in the center trust acquisition as well as amounts we borrowed on our revolving credit facility to repay center trust s line of credit and to pay off certain notes payable 
the increase was also a result of additional amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility to finance properties acquired during and interest expense also increased as a result of our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in june  our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in may and our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in july the stated interest rates of  and  respectively  on the senior notes  and the related amortization of prepaid financing costs  are higher than our cost to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility which was paid down with the net proceeds of the notes offerings 
in addition  our cost to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility has been increasing due to the federal reserve raising interest rates 
these increases in interest expense were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from the payoff of  of senior notes in february with a borrowing on our credit line which had a weighted average interest rate of at december  
table of contents general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from annual compensation increases 
as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the impairment loss of  represents a charge related to a parcel of land in reno  nevada  originally acquired in the western properties trust merger transaction  that had been held for potential development 
in the third quarter of  we sold the land parcel for less than the recorded book value which resulted in the impairment loss 
other expense increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from a write down of a receivable related to a lawsuit we brought against insurance carriers to recover our legal and settlement expenses incurred in connection with a shareholder suit related to our acquisition of western properties trust in november in july  however  the court granted summary judgment in favor of these insurance carriers 
in august  we filed a notice of our intent to appeal this judgment 
our opening appellate brief  their opposing brief  as well as our reply to this opposing brief have been filed 
the outcome of litigation is by its nature unpredictable and we therefore cannot give assurance that we will successfully appeal this judgment

recoveries from tenants were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in recovery percentage compared to the prior year period reflects the impact of the acquisition of the center trust portfolio in that center trust s historical recovery rate was lower than our recovery rate 
we expect that the recovery percentage will increase over time as occupancy is increased in the acquired assets 
other income decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease resulted principally from a reduction of interest income on our plaza escuela corporate note receivable which was repaid in the third quarter of this decrease was partially offset by interest income recorded on other notes receivable issued during related to property sales as well as interest on notes receivable we assumed upon the acquisition of the center trust portfolio

liquidity and capital resources our total market capitalization at december  was approximately  based on the market closing price of our common stock at december  of per share assuming the conversion of  operating subsidiary units to common stock and our debt outstanding of approximately  exclusive of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
as a result  our debt to total market capitalization ratio was approximately at december  our board of directors adopted a policy of limiting our indebtedness to approximately of our total market capitalization 
however  our board of directors may from time to time modify our debt policy in light of current economic or market conditions including  but not limited to  the relative costs of debt and equity capital  market conditions for debt and equity securities and fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
accordingly  we may increase or decrease our debt to market capitalization ratio beyond the limit described above 
in september  we entered into an amended and restated  revolving credit facility with a maturity date of march at december   we had  drawn on our revolving credit facility leaving  available to borrow 
at our option  amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility bear interest at either libor plus or a reference rate 
the weighted average interest rate for short term libor contracts under our revolving credit facility at december  was 
we will continue to use our revolving credit facility to take advantage of select acquisition opportunities as well as to provide funds for general corporate purposes 
the amended and restated revolving credit facility contains certain financial and other covenants which we believe we are in compliance with at december  in june  we issued  of senior notes due june  in may  we issued  of senior notes due june  in july  we issued an additional  of the senior notes due june  the net proceeds from the offerings were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
consistent with senior notes previously issued by the company  we are bound by certain financial ratio covenants which we believe we are in compliance with at december  during  nine non strategic assets were sold  including two regional malls that were acquired as part of the center trust acquisition 
the sales of the regional malls generated net cash proceeds of approximately  which were used primarily to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we may in the future enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument  however  we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  further  we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes nor do we enter into energy or commodity contracts 
we expect to make distributions from net cash provided by operations 
operating cash flows in excess of amounts to be used for distributions will be invested primarily in short term investments such as collateralized securities of the united states government or its agencies  high grade commercial paper and bank deposits or be used to pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility  if any 

table of contents the following table provides recent historical distribution information quarter ended date declared record date date paid distribution per share march  february  february  march  june  may  may  june  september  august  august  september  december  october  november  december  march  january  january  february  june  may  may  june  september  august  august  september  december  november  november  december  march  february  february  march  june  may  may  june  september  august  august  september  december  november  november  december  we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our current working capital and net cash provided by operations 
we believe that our net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow us to make the distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
we also believe that the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions and developments  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities and the use of net proceeds from the disposition of non strategic assets 
we also expect to use funds available under our revolving credit facility to finance acquisition and development activities and capital improvements on an interim basis 
off balance sheet arrangements on september   plaza escuela holding co  llc completed a financing transaction with an initial funding of  bearing interest at  wherein we received a partial payoff of  on our note receivable of  on the plaza escuela property in walnut creek  california 
the remaining balance of our note of  was converted to a non managing member interest in plaza escuela holding co  llc  the entity that owns the property 
in january  we received a return of capital of  in may  we received a return of capital of  in august  we received a return of capital of  in february  we received a return of capital of  we received a return of capital for our remaining equity position of  during the second quarter of we were entitled to receive of the operating cash flows from the property through november in the fourth quarter of  we agreed to receive  in exchange for our right to receive these future operating cash flows 
proceeds from the returns of capital and cash flow participation were used primarily to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we are a general partner of a joint venture that owns north coast health center  a medical office building in encinitas  california 
during the second quarter of  the joint venture entered into a loan agreement for  bearing interest at  to purchase the building on the property 
at december   the balance of the loan was  the loan is secured by the property and is not guaranteed by us 
we account for this joint venture under the equity method 
this unconsolidated debt is the only off balance sheet financing to which we are a party 

table of contents contractual obligations and contingent liabilities our indebtedness outstanding at december   which includes debt discounts and premiums and excludes interest  representing regularly scheduled principal reductions  balloon payments  scheduled senior note redemptions and amounts due on our revolving credit facility  is as follows year amount payments due in the year include senior note redemptions of  payments due in the year include the balance drawn on our revolving credit facility at december  of  and senior note redemptions of  payments due in    and include senior note redemptions of     and  respectively 
in  property level bonds of  are due 
with regard to the payments noted above  it is likely that we will not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these amounts at maturity 
therefore  we expect to refinance this debt either through additional debt financings secured by individual properties or groups of properties  by unsecured private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 
we have future obligations relating to construction contracts and leases for real estate and office equipment under operating leases expiring at various dates through rental expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
committed amounts under construction contracts due in totaled approximately  committed amounts under construction contracts and minimum rentals under noncancellable operating leases in effect at december  were as follows and subsequent inflation substantially all of our leases provide for the recovery of all or a significant portion of all real estate taxes and operating expenses we incur 
in addition  many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures and percentage rent 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be substantially offset by expense reimbursements  contractual rent increases and percentage rent 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  which will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  and will be sensitive to inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit agreements and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed rates  although we use our line of credit for short term borrowing purposes  and could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes nor do we enter into energy or commodity contracts 
additionally  we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material as of december  in relation to total assets of  and an equity market capitalization of  our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate principal amounts shown are in thousands

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   and does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates
