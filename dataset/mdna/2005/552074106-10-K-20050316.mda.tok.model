certain joint ventures have been determined to be variable interest entities in which the company is considered the primary beneficiary

did not affect the company s consolidated net income 
the financial statements of joint ventures in which the company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated with the company s financial statements 
the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method because the company has a or less voting or economic interest and thus such joint ventures are not controlled by the company

as of december   the outstanding senior notes with a face value of million had a fair value of million  based on quotes from industry sources 
revolving credit facilities as of december   the company has four revolving credit facilities which have an aggregate maximum loan commitment of million and mature at various dates through a million revolving line of credit expires in october after that date the company may borrow amounts  subject to applicable borrowing base and concentration limitations  under this facility solely to complete the construction of residences begun prior to such date in approved projects funded by disbursements under this facility 
the final maturity date is the earlier of the date upon which the last residence  the construction of which was financed with proceeds of this loan  is sold or the date upon which such last residence is excluded from the borrowing base by the passage of time under this facility 
however  as in the past the company expects the maturity to be extended by the lender at each maturity date for an additional year 
the maximum commitment amount under this facility is million 
a million revolving line of credit finally matures in september  although after september  advances under this facility may only be made to complete previously approved projects approved on or before such date 
the maximum commitment of million under this facility is reduced by the aggregate amount of loan commitments under separate project loans issued by the lender or its affiliates to the company or its affiliates with respect to projects that are not cross collateralized with the collateral under this credit facility 
a million revolving line of credit initially matures in september after that date a the maximum commitment under this facility reduces at a rate of million per quarter beginning with the quarter ending december   with a final maturity date of september  and b advances may only be used to complete previously approved projects subject to the borrowing base as of the initial maturity date 
a million revolving line of credit became effective in june  which matures in june 
table of contents availability under each credit facility is subject not only to the maximum amount committed under the respective facility  but also to both various borrowing base and concentration limitations 
the borrowing base limits lender advances to certain agreed percentages of asset value 
the allowed percentage generally increases as the asset progresses from land under development to residence subject to contract of sale 
advances for each type of collateral become due in whole or in part  subject to possible re borrowing  and or the collateral becomes excluded from the borrowing base  after a specified period or earlier upon sale 
concentration limitations further restrict availability under the credit facilities 
the effect of these borrowing base and concentration limitations essentially is to mandate minimum levels of the company s investment in a project  with higher percentages of investment required at earlier phases of a project  and with greater absolute dollar amounts of investment required as a project progresses 
each revolving credit facility is secured by deeds of trust on the real property and improvements thereon owned by the company in the subdivision project s approved by the respective lender  as well as pledges of all net sale proceeds  related contracts and other ancillary property 
also  each credit facility includes financial covenants  which may limit the amount that may be borrowed thereunder 
outstanding advances bear interest at various rates  which approximate the prime rate 
as of december   million was outstanding under these credit facilities  with a weighted average interest rate of  and the undrawn availability was million as limited by the borrowing base formulas 
delaware lyon has guaranteed on an unsecured basis california lyon s obligations under certain of the revolving credit facilities and has provided an unsecured environmental indemnity in favor of the lender under the million bank line of credit 
under the revolving credit facilities  we are required to comply with a number of covenants  the most restrictive of which require delaware lyon to maintain a tangible net worth  as defined  of million  adjusted upwards quarterly by of delaware lyon s quarterly net income after march  a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  each as defined  of less than to  and minimum liquidity  as defined  of at least million 
as of and for the year ending december   the company is in compliance with these covenants 
construction notes payable at december   the company had construction notes payable on certain consolidated entities amounting to million 
the construction notes have various maturity dates and bear interest at rates ranging from prime plus to prime plus at december  interest is calculated on the average daily balance and is paid following the end of each month 
revolving mortgage warehouse credit facilities the company  through its mortgage subsidiary and one of its unconsolidated joint ventures  has entered into two revolving mortgage warehouse credit facilities with banks to fund its mortgage origination operations 
the original credit facility  which matures in may  provides for revolving loans of up to million outstanding  million of which is committed lender obligated to lend if stated conditions are satisfied and million is not committed lender advances are optional even if stated conditions are otherwise satisfied 
however  as in the past the company expects the maturity to be extended by the lender at each maturity date for an additional year 
in august  the company s mortgage subsidiary and one of its unconsolidated joint ventures entered into an additional million credit facility which matures in august mortgage loans are generally held for a short period of time and are typically sold to investors within to days following funding 
the facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of each of the borrowers  including the mortgage loans held for sale  all rights of each of the borrowers with respect to contractual obligations of third party investors to purchase such mortgage loans  and all proceeds of sale of such mortgage loans 
the facilities  which have libor based pricing  also contain certain financial covenants requiring the borrowers to maintain 
table of contents minimum tangible net worth  leverage  profitability and liquidity 
these facilities are non recourse and are not guaranteed by the company 
at december  the outstanding balance under these facilities was million 
land banking arrangements the company enters into purchase agreements with various land sellers 
in some instances  and as a method of acquiring land in staged takedowns  thereby minimizing the use of funds from the company s revolving credit facilities and other corporate financing sources and limiting the company s risk  the company transfers the company s right in such purchase agreements to entities owned by third parties land banking arrangements 
these entities use equity contributions and or incur debt to finance the acquisition and development of the lots 
the entities grant the company an option to acquire lots in staged takedowns 
in consideration for this option  the company makes a non refundable deposit equal to or less of the total purchase price 
additionally  the company may be subject to other penalties if lots are not acquired 
the company is under no obligation to purchase the balance of the lots  but would forfeit remaining deposits and be subject to penalties if the lots were not purchased 
the company does not have legal title to these entities or their assets and has not guaranteed their liabilities 
these land banking arrangements help the company manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings 
the use of these land banking arrangements is dependent on  among other things  the availability of capital to the option provider  general housing market conditions and geographic preferences 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  interpretation no 
 requires the consolidation of the assets  liabilities and operations of one of the company s land banking arrangements including  as of december   real estate inventories of million 
the company participates in two land banking arrangements  which are not vie s in accordance with fin  and are not consolidated as of december  the deposits and penalties related to the two land banking projects have been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
summary information with respect to the company s consolidated and unconsolidated land banking arrangements is as follows as of december  dollars in thousands consolidated unconsolidated total number of land banking projects total number of lots total purchase price balance of lots still under option and not purchased number of lots purchase price forfeited deposits and penalties if lots are not purchased joint venture financing the company and certain of its subsidiaries are general partners or members in joint ventures involved in the development and sale of residential projects 
as described more fully in recently issued accounting standards  in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as amended interpretation no 
certain joint ventures have been determined to be variable interest entities in which the company is considered the primary beneficiary 
accordingly  the assets  liabilities and operations of these joint ventures have been consolidated with the company s financial statements as of and for the year ended december  because the company already recognizes its proportionate share of joint venture earnings and losses under the equity method of accounting  the adoption of interpretation no

the company was required to and did purchase the lots owned by the new venture on a specified takedown basis through may  at a purchase price equal to million plus a preferred return on invested capital to the outside partner of the new venture 
because the company was required to purchase the lots owned by both the existing venture and the new venture  and the company controlled both ventures  the financial statements of both ventures have been consolidated with the company s financial statements

the development process is anticipated to be completed by late at which time california lyon will be required under certain specific conditions to purchase approximately one half in value of the lots 
california lyon has a indirect  minority interest in the development llcs  which are the borrowers under two secured lines of credit 
advances under the lines of credit are to be used to pay acquisition and development costs and expenses 
the lines of credit are secured by deeds of trust on the real 
table of contents property and improvements thereon owned by the applicable development llc  as well as pledges of all net sale proceeds  related contracts and other ancillary property 
the maximum commitment amounts under the lines of credit are limited by specified agreed loan to value ratios 
the maximum commitment amount under the line of credit that closed in january first line of credit is million 
subject to specified terms and conditions  california lyon and the other direct and indirect members of the development llc that is the borrower under the first line of credit  including certain affiliates of such other members  each i have guaranteed to the bank the repayment of the development llc s indebtedness under the first line of credit  completion of certain infrastructure improvements to the land  payment of necessary loan remargining obligations  and the development llc s performance under its environmental indemnity and covenants  and ii have agreed to take all actions and pay all amounts to assure that the development llc is in compliance with financial covenants

the second line of credit matures in september although the guarantee obligations of the other direct and indirect members of the development llc that is the borrower under the second line of credit  and certain of their affiliates  are similar in nature to those under the first line of credit  california lyon does not have any such guarantee obligations to the banks under the second line of credit 
however  california lyon has posted letters of credit equal to approximately million to secure its obligations as well as the development llcs obligations to the bank under both lines of credit 
further  california lyon and the other direct and indirect members of the development llcs  including certain affiliates of such other members  have entered into reimbursement and indemnity agreements to allocate any liability arising from each line of credit  including the related guarantees and letters of credit 
delaware lyon has entered into joinder agreements to be jointly and severally liable for california lyon s obligations under the reimbursement and indemnity agreements 
while the reimbursement and indemnity agreements provide that liability is generally allocated in accordance with the members percentage interests in the development llcs distributions  delaware lyon and california lyon may be liable for the full amount of the obligations guaranteed to the banks under either or both of the lines of credit in certain specified circumstances  such as those involving the default  willful misconduct or gross negligence of california lyon

assessment district bonds in some jurisdictions in which the company develops and constructs property  assessment district bonds are issued by municipalities to finance major infrastructure improvements and fees 
such financing has been an important part of financing master planned communities due to the long term nature of the financing  favorable interest rates when compared to the company s other sources of funds and the fact that the bonds are sold  administered and collected by the relevant government entity

the risks inherent in purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing 
table of contents decreases 
thus  the company may have bought and developed land on which it cannot profitably build and sell homes 
the market value of land  building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions 
in addition  inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market 
in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions  the company may have to sell homes at significantly lower margins or at a loss 
net cash used in provided by investing activities decreased to a use of million in from a source of million in the change was primarily a result of i a decrease in cash distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures to million in from million in  and ii an increase in cash paid for property and equipment to million in from in due to the purchase of an aircraft

the successful issuance of the senior notes in  offset by the repayment of the senior notes  as described in financing activities below provided the company with increased financial resources 
the increase in real estate inventories resulted from i the company s improved financial condition and its ability to finance more of its operations during as wholly owned projects rather than being financed as unconsolidated joint venture projects and ii the consolidation of variable interest entities in as described above

off balance sheet arrangements the company enters into certain off balance sheet arrangements including joint venture financing  option agreements  land banking arrangements and variable interests in consolidated and unconsolidated entities

table of contents contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations consisted of the following at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years revolving credit facilities construction notes payable senior notes senior notes senior notes operating leases purchase obligations land purchases and option commitments project commitments total inflation the company s revenues and profitability may be affected by increased inflation rates and other general economic conditions 
in periods of high inflation  demand for the company s homes may be reduced by increases in mortgage interest rates 
further  the company s profits will be affected by its ability to recover through higher sales prices increases in the costs of land  construction  labor and administrative expenses 
the company s ability to raise prices at such times will depend upon demand and other competitive factors 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those which impact its most critical accounting policies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following accounting policies are among the most important to a portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require among the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments real estate inventories and cost of sales real estate inventories are carried at cost net of impairment losses  if any 
real estate inventories consist primarily of deposits  raw land  lots under development  homes under construction and completed homes of real estate projects 
all direct and indirect land costs  offsite and onsite improvements and applicable interest and other carrying charges are capitalized to real estate projects during periods when the project is under development 
land  offsite costs and all other common costs are allocated to land parcels benefited based upon relative fair values before construction 
onsite construction costs and related carrying charges principally interest and property taxes are allocated to the individual homes within a phase based upon the relative sales value of the homes 
the estimation process involved in determining relative fair values and sales values is inherently uncertain because it involves estimates of current market values for land parcels before construction as well as future sales values of individual homes within a phase 
the company s estimate of future sales values is supported by the company s budgeting process 
the estimate of future sales values is inherently uncertain because it requires 
table of contents estimates of current market conditions as well as future market events and conditions 
additionally  in determining the allocation of costs to a particular land parcel or individual home  the company relies on project budgets that are based on a variety of assumptions  including assumptions about construction schedules and future costs to be incurred 
it is possible that actual results could differ from budgeted amounts for various reasons  including construction delays  increases in costs which have not yet been committed  or unforeseen issues encountered during construction that fall outside the scope of contracts obtained 
while the actual results for a particular construction project are accurately reported over time  a variance between the budget and actual costs could result in the understatement or overstatement of costs and a related impact on gross margins in a specific reporting period 
to reduce the potential for such distortion  the company has set forth procedures which have been applied by the company on a consistent basis  including assessing and revising project budgets on a monthly basis  obtaining commitments from subcontractors and vendors for future costs to be incurred  reviewing the adequacy of warranty accruals and historical warranty claims experience  and utilizing the most recent information available to estimate costs 
the variances between budget and actual amounts identified by the company have historically not had a material impact on its consolidated results of operations 
management believes that the company s policies provide for reasonably dependable estimates to be used in the calculation and reporting of costs 
the company relieves its accumulated real estate inventories through cost of sales for the cost of homes sold  as described more fully below in the section entitled sales and profit recognition 
impairment of real estate inventories the company accounts for its real estate inventories under financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement no 

statement no 
requires impairment losses to be recorded on assets to be held and used by the company when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
the estimation process used in determining the undiscounted cash flows of the assets is inherently uncertain because it involves estimates of future revenues and costs 
as described more fully above in the section entitled real estate inventories and cost of sales  estimates of revenues and costs are supported by the company s budgeting process 
when an impairment loss is required for assets to be held and used by the company  the related assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value 
fair value represents the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than a forced or liquidation sale 
the estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of fair value is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of current market yields as well as future events and conditions 
such future events and conditions include economic and market conditions  as well as the availability of suitable financing to fund development and construction activities 
the realization of the company s real estate inventories is dependent upon future uncertain events and conditions and  accordingly  the actual timing and amounts realized by the company may be materially different from their estimated fair values 
sales and profit recognition a sale is recorded and profit recognized when a sale is consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investments are adequate  any receivables are not subject to future subordination  and the usual risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
when it is determined that the earnings process is not complete  profit is deferred for recognition in future periods

if the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  the assets  liabilities and operations of the vie will be consolidated with the company s financial statements 
based on the company s analysis of arrangements created after january   no vies had been created for the period from february  through december  with respect to option agreements as identified under clause i of the previous paragraph
