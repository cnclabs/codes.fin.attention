overview of our business ariba provides spend management solutions that allow enterprises to efficiently manage the purchasing of non payroll goods and services required to run their business 
we refer to these non payroll expenses as spend 
our solutions include software  network access  professional services and expertise 
they are designed to provide enterprises with technology and business process improvements to better manage their spend and  in turn  save money 
our software and services streamline and improve the business processes related to the identification of suppliers of goods and services  the negotiation of the terms of purchases  and ultimately the management of ongoing purchasing and settlement activities 
our software is built to leverage the internet and provide enterprises with real time access to their business data and their business partners 
they are designed to integrate with all major platforms and can be accessed via a web browser 
our software can be deployed as an installed application or provided as a service in an on demand model 
in addition to application software  ariba spend management solutions include implementation and strategic consulting services  education and training  commodity expertise and decision support services  benchmarking services  low cost country sourcing services and procurement outsourcing services 
ariba spend management solutions also integrate with and leverage the ariba supplier network 
the ariba supplier network is a scalable internet infrastructure that connects our buying organizations with their suppliers to exchange product and service information as well as a broad range of business documents  such as purchase orders and invoices 
over  registered suppliers  offering a wide array of goods and services  are connected to the ariba supplier network 
ariba spend management solutions are organized around six key functions spend visibility  sourcing  contract management  procurement and expense  invoice and payment  and supplier management 
through our solution offerings  we help customers develop a strategy for spend management and enable a step by step approach with technology and services that work together 
business model ariba spend management solutions are delivered in a flexible manner  depending upon the needs and preferences of the customer 
for customers seeking self sufficiency  we offer flexible  highly configurable and easy to use technology and related services that can be deployed behind the firewall or delivered as an on demand service 
for customers seeking expert assistance  we offer sourcing process and commodity expertise in over categories of spend 
finally  for those customers seeking managed services  we offer tailored solutions to outsource processes  spend categories  or entire procurement operations 
we have aligned our business model with the way we believe customers want to purchase and deploy spend management solutions 
customers may generally subscribe to our software products and services for a specified 
table of contents term  purchase a perpetual software license and or pay for services on a time and materials basis  depending upon their business requirements 
our revenue is comprised of license fees  subscription and maintenance fees  and services and other fees 
license revenue consists of fees charged for the use of our software products under perpetual or term agreements 
subscription and maintenance revenue consists of fees charged for hosted software solutions and fees for product updates and support  as well as fees paid by suppliers for access to the ariba supplier network 
services and other revenue consists of fees for implementation services  consulting services  managed services  training  education  premium support and other miscellaneous items  which are more fully described in business ariba spend management expertise 
due to the different treatment of our revenue streams under applicable accounting guidance  each type of revenue has a different impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the majority of our license fees are from perpetual software license sales 
revenue from these license sales is often recognized in the quarter that the software is delivered 
individual software license sales can be significant greater than million and sales cycles are often lengthy and difficult to predict 
as such  the timing of a few large software license transactions or the recognition of license revenue from these transactions can substantially affect our quarterly operating results 
by contrast  subscription fees for hosted software solutions are generally fixed for a specific period of time  and revenue is recognized ratably over the term 
therefore  a subscription license will result in significantly lower current period revenue than an equal sized perpetual license  but with revenue recognized in future periods 
similarly  maintenance fees are generally fixed for a specific period of time  and revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
maintenance contracts are typically entered into when new software licenses are purchased  at a percentage of the software license fee 
in addition  most of our customers renew their maintenance contracts annually to continue receiving product updates and product support 
given the ratable revenue recognition and historically high renewal rates of our subscription and maintenance agreements  this revenue stream has generally been more stable over time 
finally  service revenues are driven by a contract  project or statement of work  in which the fees may be fixed for specific services to be provided over time or billed on a time and materials basis 
like subscription and maintenance fees  service fees have generally been more stable over time as revenue has been recognized over the course of the fixed time or project period 
these different revenue streams also carry different gross margins 
revenue from license fees tends to be high margin revenue  and gross margins are often greater than 
revenue from subscription and maintenance fees also tends to be higher margin revenue  but not quite as high as license fees  with gross margins typically in the to range 
license  subscription and maintenance fees are generally based on software products developed by us  which carry minimal marginal cost to reproduce and sell 
revenue from labor intensive services and other fees tends to be lower margin revenue  with gross margins typically in the to range 
our overall gross margins could fluctuate from period to period depending upon the mix of revenue 
for example  a period with a higher mix of license revenue versus services revenue would drive overall gross margin higher and vice versa 
overview of fiscal year several major factors had a significant impact on our business during fiscal year most notable was our merger with freemarkets on july  and our acquisitions of alliente and softface in the first half of fiscal year these business combinations added to our software and services capabilities and increased our revenues 
we also experienced organic growth in our services revenues  as our business model continues to shift from software sales to providing comprehensive solutions including both software applications and strategic services 
in summary  these and other factors caused our revenues to increase by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year while our revenues expanded significantly during fiscal year  the growth did not meet our expectations  as two primary factors limited our revenue growth 
first  our software sales shifted from predominantly perpetual 
table of contents licenses  with upfront revenue recognition  to more subscription or term licenses  with revenue recognition spread out over time 
this trend caused our license revenue to decline in fiscal year however  we did increase our backlog of subscription software contracts  which we anticipate will be recognized as revenue during fiscal year and beyond 
second  our subscription services business  formerly known as fullsource  declined throughout the year  but we believe this business stabilized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year these changes in our revenues caused us to take additional restructuring actions during the second half of fiscal year to further reduce expenses below our merger cost synergy targets 
more specifically  license revenues of million were down compared to fiscal year  primarily due to a shift from perpetual software licenses to more subscription and hosted term licenses and a difficult selling environment  particularly for large enterprise software deals 
subscription and maintenance revenues of million were up compared to fiscal year  primarily due to the addition of software subscription revenues from freemarkets and growth in other subscription revenue streams such as fees for access to the ariba supplier network 
maintenance revenues were relatively flat compared to fiscal year finally  services and other revenues of million were up compared to fiscal year  primarily due to the addition of service revenues from freemarkets  as well as organic growth of the ariba services organization 
as a result of these trends  we experienced a significant shift in our revenue mix  with license revenues contributing of total revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year  subscription and maintenance revenues contributing of total revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year and services and other revenues contributing of total revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year since the cost of software license revenues is typically much lower than the cost of services revenues  the shift in our revenue mix contributed to a decline in our gross margin for fiscal year to compared to in also contributing to the decline in our gross margin was a charge of million for the amortization of acquired technology and customer intangible assets in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year operating expenses increased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to a goodwill impairment charge of million  a lease abandonment charge of million resulting from revisions of our estimates for sublease rental projections and a charge of million resulting from the settlement of a patent infringement case 
the remainder of the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to an increased charge for stock based compensation of million due to restricted stock grants in fiscal year these amounts were partially offset by income of million recognized in fiscal year from our settlement with softbank corp  a japanese corporation  and its subsidiaries collectively  softbank in october in sum  our total expenses  including cost of revenue and other items  increased to million compared to million in fiscal year  which caused a net loss of million compared to million in fiscal year outlook for fiscal year we anticipate that the shift in our software business from license sales to subscription sales will continue during fiscal year more specifically  we believe license revenue will decline again in fiscal year  but the sequential declines in quarterly license revenue should be at a slower pace as compared to fiscal year and eventually flatten out by the end of fiscal year we expect growth in subscription revenue over the second half of fiscal year to offset the declines in license revenue 
we believe that our subscription services business has largely stabilized and services and other revenue will grow in fiscal year  led by continued expansion of our consulting services and growth in our procurement outsourcing business 
in summary  we expect these trends to largely offset each other  with total revenue remaining relatively flat on a sequential basis for the next few quarters 
from an expense standpoint  our recent restructuring activities are largely complete  and we anticipate that costs and expenses over the next few quarters will remain relatively consistent with our costs and expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents we believe that our success for fiscal year will depend largely on our ability to manage the shift to an on demand delivery model from both a product and a financial standpoint  sell bundled solution offerings that include both technology and expert services  renew our subscription or time based revenues  including on demand software fees  maintenance fees  and fees for certain services  and capitalize on new revenue opportunities  such as access fees for the ariba supplier network  procurement outsourcing  and selling on demand spend management solutions to small and mid market customers 
we believe that key risks to our future revenues include our ability to shift from selling perpetual license software to on demand subscription solutions  our ability to renew ratable revenue streams without substantial declines from prior arrangements  including subscription software  software maintenance and subscription services  our ability to generate organic growth  the market acceptance of spend management solutions as a standalone market category  the overall level of information technology spending  and potential declines in average selling prices 
we believe that key risks to our future operating profitability include our ability to maintain or grow our revenues  a shift in our mix of revenues from higher margin license fees to lower margin services and other fees  our ability to maintain utilization of our services organization  and the potential adverse impacts resulting from legal proceedings 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies at a relatively early stage of development  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets  have completed several acquisitions over the past eighteen months and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties

table of contents comparison of the fiscal years ended september   and revenues please refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements and application of critical accounting policies and estimates below for a description of our accounting policy related to revenue recognition 
license license revenues for the year ended september  were million  a decrease from license revenues of million for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily attributable to a shift from perpetual license sales to more subscription and hosted term license software sales and the continued difficult selling environment for enterprise software applications 
in the future  we believe that license revenues in any period will be increasingly dependent on new customer licenses entered into in that quarter rather than on revenues from licenses entered into in prior quarters 
license revenues for the year ended september  were million  a decrease from license revenues of million for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of million in the recognition of previously deferred license revenues in the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  and a decline of million in license revenues from our softbank relationship in the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  we generally ship our software products shortly after entering into a license contract 
however  product shipment may be delayed for a number of factors  including factors within our discretion 
for example  delivery dates may be affected by the number of software license orders shipped or received in the quarter  the degree to which software license orders are concentrated at the end of the quarter  and our operational ability to fulfill software license orders at the end of the quarter 
any delay in shipping software products may have the effect of reducing revenue in the current period and increasing revenue in future periods 
subscription and maintenance subscription and maintenance revenues for the year ended september  were million  a increase from subscription and maintenance revenues of million for the year ended september  subscription revenues consist mainly of fees for software access subscription and hosted software services

goodwill impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform a test for impairment on an annual basis or as events and circumstances indicate that goodwill or other intangible assets may be impaired and that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
we perform our annual assessment for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in june  based on a combination of factors  particularly our market capitalization  our current and projected operating results  significant trends in the enterprise software industry  and our decision to reduce our workforce and eliminate excess facility space  we concluded there were sufficient indicators to require us to assess whether any portion of our recorded goodwill balance was impaired 
we determined that our estimated fair value was less than the recorded amount of our net assets  thereby necessitating that we assess our recorded goodwill for impairment 
as required by sfas no 
 in measuring the amount of goodwill impairment  we made a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the company to the tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill and liabilities 
based on this allocation  we concluded that goodwill was impaired in the amount of million 
we performed the annual assessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and no further indication of goodwill impairment was noted 
litigation provision we recorded a million provision related to the settlement of our patent infringement litigation during the year ended september  for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net for the year ended september  was million  an increase of million from interest and other income  net of million for the year ended september  the increase is primarily attributable to a realized net gain on a japanese yen cash flow hedge in the amount of million 
in december  we hedged a portion of the net assets of nihon ariba using foreign currency forward contracts japanese yen to offset the translation and economic exposures related to anticipated cash flows from this subsidiary 
the japanese yen hedge minimized currency risk arising from cash held in japanese yen as a result of the softbank settlement in october the increase in interest and other income  net is also attributable to an increase in realized foreign currency transaction gains in the amount of million on accounts receivable billed from ariba  inc in foreign currencies to customers headquartered in foreign countries 
the foreign currency transaction gains are primarily due to the us dollar weakening against the euro and the british pound in the first half of interest and other income  net for the year ended september  was million  a decrease from interest and other income of million for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in interest income due to lower invested cash  cash equivalents and investment balances as well as a change in mix to lower interest bearing accounts  and a decrease of million attributable to realized gains and losses on investments due to international currency fluctuations 
provision benefit for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision benefit of million   and  for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the income tax provision of million recorded in the year ended september  is primarily attributable to the million tax effect related to the buy out of the minority interests from softbank in october   recorded for the repatriation of cash from ariba 
table of contents korea and a slight increase in foreign income taxes 
the income tax benefit of  and  recorded in the years ended september  and  respectively  relates to net tax refunds from various state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations imposed by internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of our federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
as of september   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately billion and million  respectively  before consideration of any annual limitations as described above 
these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years from fiscal year through fiscal year and from fiscal year through fiscal year  respectively 
as of september   we had research credit carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal research credit carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal year through fiscal year the state research credit carryforwards will continue indefinitely  except for  which will expire in we also had manufacturer s credit carryforwards as of september  for state tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in various years from fiscal year through fiscal year our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards include net operating loss and research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  generated by freemarkets  which are subject to annual limitations which could reduce or defer the utilization of those losses and credits 
minority interests in december  our consolidated subsidiary  nihon ariba kk nihon ariba  sold approximately of its common stock for cash consideration of approximately million to softbank pursuant to our strategic relationship with softbank 
in april  nihon ariba sold an additional of its common stock for cash consideration of approximately million to third parties 
also in april  our consolidated subsidiary  ariba korea  ltd 
ariba korea  sold approximately of its common stock for cash consideration of approximately million to softbank 
prior to the transactions  we held of the equity of nihon ariba and ariba korea in the form of common stock 
in october  we purchased the interest in nihon ariba and the interest in ariba korea held by softbank for million 
during the remainder of  we purchased the remaining minority interest in nihon ariba held by minority shareholders 
these transactions resulted in a million reduction to minority interests during the year ended september  as of september  and  minority interest of zero and approximately million  respectively  was recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in order to reflect the share of the net assets of nihon ariba and ariba korea held by minority investors 
for the years ended september  and  we increased consolidated net loss by  and million  as the minority interest s share of income  respectively 
for the year ended september   we reduced consolidated net loss by approximately  as the minority interest s share of losses 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and million in restricted cash  for total cash  cash equivalents and investments of million 
our working capital on september  was million

our working capital on september  was million 

table of contents the decrease in total cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash of million for the year ended september  is primarily attributable to the cash outflow of million associated with the eplus settlement in february and the million associated with the softbank settlement in october the net cash outflow to softbank was comprised of the following repayment of million of the interim payments received in connection with the softbank arbitration proceedings  which represented the amounts owed to ariba for software and support under the strategic relationship with softbank  payment of million to buy out softbank s minority interests in nihon ariba and ariba korea  and million received from softbank for a three year software license of the ariba sourcing and ariba analysis product lines 
excluding the eplus and softbank settlements  total cash and investments decreased million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year september   compared to million of net cash used in operating activities for year ended september  cash flows from operating activities decreased a total of million primarily due to the following a decrease of million associated with the net softbank activity 
in the year ended september   we received interim payments of million from softbank pursuant to an arbitration proceeding in november in the year ended september   the net cash outflow to softbank was million as described above 
see also the offsetting increase in investing activities noted below  a decrease of million associated with the eplus settlement in february  and a higher net loss  excluding non cash charges  in the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the above items were partially offset by the following an increase of million relating to a payment received from a subtenant in the year ended september   an increase of million from the decrease in deferred revenue comparing the year ended september  to september  this is primarily due to the million decrease in deferred revenue in the year ended september   principally due to the recognition of more revenue from contracts entered into during prior periods than new deferrals originating in the year ended september   and an increase of million from accounts receivable comparing the year ended september  to september   which represents the difference in the net change in accounts receivable in the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended september  the increase in net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended september  is primarily attributable to the net softbank activity of million described above and the million used to acquire freemarkets  alliente and softface in the year ended september   partially offset by reduced proceeds of million from sales of marketable securities  net of purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended september  net cash provided by financing activities is attributable to the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and from the employee stock purchase plan of million and million in the years ended september  and  respectively 
the amount in the year ended september  was partially offset by million used to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock 
as of september   we did not have any commitments for capital expenditures 

table of contents contractual obligations our primary contractual obligations are under our operating leases and a letter of credit which are discussed below 
in march  we entered into a facility lease agreement for  square feet in four office buildings and an amenities building in sunnyvale  california for our headquarters 
the operating lease term commenced in and ends in january we occupy  square feet in this facility  and currently sublease two and one half buildings totaling  square feet to third parties 
these subleases expire between july and august the remaining  square feet is available for sublease 
minimum monthly lease payments are million and escalate annually  with the total future minimum lease payments amounting to million over the remaining lease term 
as part of this lease agreement  we are required to hold certificates of deposit  totaling million as of september   as a form of security through fiscal year also  we are required by other lease agreements to hold an additional million of standby letters of credit  which are cash collateralized 
these instruments are issued by our banks in lieu of a cash security deposit required by landlords for domestic and international real estate leases 
the total cash collateral of million is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  we also occupy  square feet of office space in pittsburgh  pennsylvania under a lease covering  square feet that expires in may the remaining  square feet is available for sublease 
this location consists principally of our services organization and administrative activities 
future minimum lease payments and sublease income under noncancelable operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of september  in thousands year ending september  lease payments contractual sublease income net obligations thereafter total of the total operating lease commitments as of september  noted above  million is for occupied properties and million is for abandoned properties  which are a component of the restructuring obligation 
in november  we repaid in full an outstanding loan with the commonwealth of pennsylvania for  other than the lease commitments and letters of credit discussed above  we do not have commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby repurchase obligations or other such debt arrangements 
we do not have any material noncancelable purchase commitments as of september  off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated limited purpose entities  nor do we have any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 
anticipated cash flows we expect to incur significant operating costs  particularly related to services delivery costs  sales and marketing  research and development and restructuring costs  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our 
table of contents business plan 
we anticipate that such operating costs  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
as a result  our net cash flows will depend heavily on the level of future sales  payments of restructuring and integration charges  changes in deferred revenues  our ability to manage infrastructure costs  the outcome of our subleasing activities related to abandoned excess leased facilities  the use of cash under our stock repurchase program and ongoing regulatory and legal proceedings 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  should be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  given the significant changes in our business and results of operations in the last twelve to eighteen months  the fluctuation in cash and investment balances may be greater than presently anticipated 
see risk factors 
after the next twelve months  we may find it necessary to obtain additional funds 
in the event additional funds are required  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and  in part  are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring obligations related to abandoned operating leases and contingencies related to the collectibility of accounts receivable and pending litigation 
these policies and our practices related to these policies are described below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenues are derived from three sources i licensing software  ii providing hosted software solutions  technical support and product updates  otherwise known as subscription and maintenance  and iii providing services  including implementation services  consulting services  managed services  training  education  premium support and other miscellaneous services 
our standard end user license agreement provides for use of our software under either a perpetual license or a time based license based on the number of users 
we license our software in multiple element arrangements in which the customer typically purchases a combination of some or all of the following i software products  either on a standalone or hosted basis  ii a maintenance arrangement  which is generally priced as a percentage of the software license fees and provides for technical support and product updates typically over a period of one year  and iii a services arrangement  on either a fixed fee for access to specific services over time or a time and materials basis 
we license our products through our direct sales force and indirectly through resellers 
the license agreements for our products generally do not provide for a right of return  and historically product returns have not been significant 
we do not recognize revenue for refundable fees or agreements with cancellation rights until such rights to refund or cancellation have expired 
we recognize revenue on sales to resellers upon sell through to the end user 
collectibility of receivables is assessed based on the reseller s ability to pay 
commissions or fees paid to partners under co sale arrangements are included as cost of license revenues at the time of sale  when the liability is incurred and is reasonably estimable 
access to certain functionality on the ariba supplier network is available to ariba licensees as part of their maintenance agreements for certain products 

table of contents we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product or service has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
payment terms are considered extended when greater than of an arrangement fee is due beyond twelve months from delivery 
in these scenarios  fees are not fixed or determinable  and therefore revenue is recognized when fees are due and payable 
in arrangements where at least of license fees are due within one year or less from delivery  the entire arrangement fee is considered fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the remaining basic revenue recognition criteria are met  provided that any accompanying services are not considered essential to the functionality of the software products 
if collectibility is not considered probable at the inception of the arrangement  we do not recognize revenue until the fee is collected 
we allocate and recognize revenue on contracts that include software using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of sop  as amended by sop under the residual method  revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement  but does not exist for at least one of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
we defer revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements eg  maintenance and consulting services and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the delivered elements eg  software products when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
where the contract does not include software  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on its respective fair value 
our determination of the fair value of each element in a multiple element arrangement involving software is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  which is limited to the price when sold separately 
for all other transactions not involving software  fair value is determined using the price when sold separately or other methods allowable under eitf revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue from hosting and sourcing solutions services is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as the access is provided over the related contract period 
revenue allocated to software implementation  process improvement  training and other services is recognized as the services are performed 
the proportion of total revenue from new license arrangements that is recognized upon delivery may vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the relative mix of types of licensing arrangements and the availability of vsoe of fair value for undelivered elements 
certain of our perpetual and time based licenses include the right to unspecified additional products 
we recognize revenue from perpetual and time based licenses that include unspecified additional software products ratably over the longer of the term of the time based license or the period of commitment to such unspecified additional products 
in addition  certain of our contracts include performance incentive payments based on market volume and or savings generated  as defined in the respective contracts 
revenue from such arrangements is recognized as those thresholds are achieved 
arrangements that include consulting services  such as system implementation and process improvement  are evaluated to determine whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software products 
when services are not considered essential  the revenue allocable to the services is recognized separately from the software  provided vsoe of fair value exists 
if the company does not have fair value for at least one of the undelivered elements in an arrangement  we defer revenue recognition until the elements are delivered  or if the undelivered elements are a subscription or time based service  recognize revenue ratably over the longest contractual term in the arrangement 
for allocation purposes  where more than one element in an arrangement does not have fair value  target pricing is used to allocate the amount remaining after allocating revenue to those elements which have fair value 

table of contents if we provide consulting services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software products  both the software product revenue and service revenue are recognized under contract accounting in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues from these arrangements are recognized under the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to date to total projected labor hours  except in limited circumstances where completion status cannot be reasonably estimated  in which case the completed contract method is used 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized  and generally results from deferred maintenance and support  consulting or training services not yet rendered and license revenue deferred until all requirements under sop are met 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue upon delivery of our product  as services are rendered  or as other requirements under sop  sab or eitf are satisfied 
deferred revenue excludes contract amounts for which payment has yet to be collected 
likewise  accounts receivable excludes amounts due from customers for which revenue has been deferred 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide for actual losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts might be required 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for the remaining customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the aggregate receivables are outstanding  the current business environment and historical experience 
alternatively  if the financial condition of our customers were to improve such that their ability to make payments was no longer considered impaired  we would reduce related estimated reserves with a credit to the provision for doubtful accounts 
recoverability of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired and that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreases in our market capitalization below the recorded amount of our net assets for a sustained period 
our stock price is highly volatile and has experienced significant declines since january in june  based on a combination of factors  particularly our current market capitalization  our current and projected operating results  significant trends in the enterprise software industry  and our decision to reduce our workforce and eliminate excess facility space  we concluded there were sufficient indicators to require us to assess whether any portion of our recorded goodwill balance was impaired 
we determined that our estimated fair value was less than the recorded amount of our net assets  thereby necessitating that we assess our recorded goodwill for impairment 
as required by sfas no 
 in measuring the amount of goodwill impairment  we made a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the company to the tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill and liabilities 
based on this allocation  we concluded that goodwill was impaired in the amount of million 
we performed the annual assessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and no further indication of goodwill impairment was noted 
the remaining balance of goodwill is million as of september   and there can be no assurances that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of 
table of contents the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
lease abandonment costs we initially recorded a significant restructuring charge in the third quarter of fiscal year upon abandoning certain operating leases as part of a program to restructure our operations and related facilities 
in the years ended september  and  we revised our original estimates and expectations for our corporate headquarters and field offices disposition efforts as a result of changed estimates of sublease rental projections 
during the year ended september   due to further consolidation and abandonment of additional facilities as the result of our merger with freemarkets  we recorded additional restructuring costs of million 
we also i revised our estimates for sublease rental projections resulting in an additional charge of million  and ii recorded a benefit to operating expense totaling million  primarily as a result of entering into a sublease agreement which was not anticipated in previous estimates of the restructuring obligation 
in addition  we assumed lease abandonment liabilities of million as of july  related to the former headquarters of freemarkets in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
during the year ended september   we revised our estimates for sublease rental projections resulting in a charge of million 
we also recorded a million adjustment to our restructuring obligation in march that was related to a prior period 
based on the guidance in sab  we concluded that the amount of the prior period error was immaterial to the current and prior period 
in july  we re assessed our office space in pittsburgh  pennsylvania and ceased use of one of the floors we lease through  which resulted in a charge of million 
finally  we recorded a million adjustment to the restructuring obligation due to the closure of an excess legacy freemarkets facility 
this restructuring adjustment was considered part of purchase accounting for freemarkets and has been recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
lease abandonment costs for the abandoned facilities were estimated to include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees and sublease rates using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage firm retained by us 
we review these estimates each quarterly reporting period  and to the extent that our assumptions change  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary significantly from current estimates 
as of september   we had contractual commitments of million for abandoned properties 
our lease abandonment accrual is net of million of estimated sublease income 
actual sublease payments due under noncancelable subleases of excess facilities totaled million as of september   and the remainder of anticipated sublease income represents management s estimate of amounts to be received under future subleases 
actual future cash requirements and lease abandonment costs may differ materially from the accrual at september   particularly if actual sublease income is significantly different from current estimates 
these differences could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash position 
for example  a reduction in assumed market lease rates of per square foot per month for the remaining term of the lease  with all other assumptions remaining the same  would increase the estimated lease abandonment loss on our sunnyvale  california headquarters and our other principal office in pittsburgh  pennsylvania by approximately million as of september  legal contingencies we are subject to various claims and legal actions 
see legal proceedings 
we accrue for estimated losses in accordance with gaap for those matters where we believe that the likelihood that a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
although we currently believe that we have properly accrued for estimable and probable losses regarding the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings  claims and litigation involving us  litigation is inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that existing or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition or that the current amount of accrued losses is sufficient for any actual losses that may be incurred 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we develop products primarily in the united states of america and india and market our products primarily in the united states of america  europe and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since the majority of our non us sales are priced in currencies other than the us dollar  a strengthening of the dollar may reduce the level of reported revenues 
if any of the events described above were to occur  our net sales could be seriously impacted  since a large portion of our net sales are derived from international operations 
for the years ended september   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales were derived from customers outside of the united states 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we utilize forward contracts to reduce our net exposures  by currency  related to the monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign operations denominated in local currency 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  all of these instruments are marked to market at each balance sheet date by a charge to earnings 
we believe that these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts are generally offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year 
the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of september  in thousands buy sell contract value unrealized gain loss in usd foreign currency usd foreign currency euro sell   great british pound buy   switzerland franc buy  singapore dollar buy  total the unrealized gain loss represents the difference between the contract value and the market value of the contract based on market rates as of september  given our foreign exchange position  a ten percent change in foreign exchange rates upon which these forward exchange contracts are based would result in unrealized exchange gains or losses of approximately  in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange losses or gains on the underlying net monetary exposures 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from other foreign currency exposures 
cash flow risk in january and december  we hedged anticipated cash flows from ariba korea and nihon ariba  respectively  using foreign currency forward contracts korean won and japanese yen to offset the translation 
table of contents and economic exposures related to those cash flows 
the korean won and japanese yen hedges minimize currency risk arising from cash held in korean won and japanese yen as a result of the softbank settlement in october in september  the cash held in nihon ariba was repatriated and a gain of million was realized on these foreign currency contracts in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the change in fair value of the korean won forward contract attributable to the changes in forward exchange rates the effective portion is reported in stockholders equity 
it is anticipated that the majority of the cash held in ariba korea will be repatriated in the next six months 
the notional amount of our hedge was billion korean won million as of september  the unrealized net gain on the korean won cash flow hedge reported in stockholders equity was  as of september  interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
we hold investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  and both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investments may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and as such we may suffer losses at the time of sale due to the decline in market value 
all investments in the table below are carried at market value  which approximates cost
