item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this filing 
except where the context suggests otherwise  the terms we  us and our refer to sealy corporation and its subsidiaries 
we have reclassified the selected financial data for all periods presented to reflect the operations of our european manufacturing operations in france and italy and our operations in brazil as discontinued operations 
see results of operations discontinued operations later in this item for more information 
unless otherwise noted  discussions below pertain to our continuing operations 
financial highlights revenues for fiscal were  million  with income from operations of million and a net loss from continuing operations of million 
these results were impacted by the following key items our consolidated net sales for fiscal increased million  or from fiscal year due to sales increases in our south american  mexico  and us operations which were partially offset by sales decreases in canada 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points from fiscal to 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in material and other costs due in part to inflation pressures on the underlying commodities 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal  principally due to approximately million of incremental costs incurred related to product launches which relate primarily to the next generation posturepedic and stearns foster product lines 
total incremental product launch costs for fiscal were million 
these costs relate primarily to the next generation posturepedic line and the acceleration of our rollout of the next generation stearns foster product line 
through the first nine months of  ispa has reported significant growth in the specialty non innerspring sector of the market 
according to ispa s sampling of bedding manufacturers  sales of specialty bedding for the first nine months of increased from prior year levels  while sales of traditional innerspring products increased a more modest from prior year levels 
approximately of our domestic sales for fiscal were for innerspring product 
given the concentration of our product sales in this sector of the market  we have experienced more modest sales growth through fiscal in order to take advantage of the faster growing specialty sector of the market  we are establishing a new specialty division which will be focused on the development  promotion and selling of specialty product 
we also plan to introduce a new line of specialty product in fiscal business overview we manufacture and market a complete line of bedding innerspring and non innerspring products  including mattresses and box springs  holding leading positions in key market categories such as luxury bedding products and among leading retailers 
our conventional bedding products include the sealy  sealy posturepedic  stearns foster and bassett brands and accounted for approximately of our total domestic net sales for the year ended november  in addition to our innerspring bedding  we also produce a variety of visco elastic memory foam and latex foam bedding products 
we expect to gain market share in these product lines as we seek to strengthen our competitive position in the specialty bedding non innerspring mattress market 
we distinguish ourselves from our major competitors in part by maintaining our own component parts manufacturing capability and producing substantially all of our mattress innerspring and latex mattress components requirements 
we believe we are one of the largest bedding manufacturers in the world  with a wholesale domestic market share of approximately in we believe that we have experienced domestic market share declines during based on the relative strength of the specialty sector and our concentration in innerspring product 
our segments are identified and aggregated based on our organizational structure  which is organized around geographic areas 
from a geographical perspective  our operations are concentrated in the united states  canada  mexico  south america and puerto rico  with our dominant operations being in the united states 
our foreign subsidiaries contributed of our total revenues during fiscal compared to in fiscal the moderate increase from the prior year has been driven by sales increases in our south american and mexico businesses which have been partially offset by sales decreases in canada 
raw materials and commodity prices during fiscal  the costs of our steel innerspring  polyurethane foam  and polyethlylene component parts increased and ultimately stabilized in the latter part of fiscal while these costs increased during fiscal  they have stabilized as the prices of the underlying commodities adjusted to market conditions 
during fiscal  we saw increases in the cost of diesel fuel which negatively impacted our inbound freight and delivery costs which are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively 
continued volatility in the price of fuel will continue to have an impact on these costs 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
us gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
we choose accounting policies within us gaap that our management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
our management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions 
our accounting policies are stated in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item we believe the following accounting estimates are critical to understanding our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements cooperative advertising  rebate and other promotional programs we enter into agreements with our customers to provide funds to the customer for advertising and promotion of our products 
we also enter into volume and other rebate programs with our customers whereby funds may be rebated to the customer 
when sales are made to these customers  we record liabilities pursuant to these agreements 
we periodically assess these liabilities based on actual sales and claims to determine whether all of the cooperative advertising earned will be used by the customer or whether the customers will meet the requirements to receive rebate funds 
we generally negotiate these agreements on a customer by customer basis 
some of these agreements extend over several periods and are linked with supply agreements 
most of these agreements coincide with our fiscal year  however  our customers typically have ninety days following the end of a period to submit claims for reimbursement of advertising and promotional costs 
therefore  significant estimates are required at any point in time with regard to the ultimate reimbursement to be claimed by our customers 
subsequent revisions to such estimates are recorded and charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified 
changes in underlying spending patterns related to these incentive programs could impact our margins 
costs of these programs totaled million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
of these costs  amounts associated with volume rebates  supply agreement amortization  slotting fees  end consumer rebates and other customer allowances which were recorded as a reduction of sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
amounts recorded as a reduction of sales in the us were million  million and million  respectively 
the costs associated with cooperative advertising were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses and were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts the credit environment in which our customers operate has stabilized somewhat over the past two years  however  the continued management of credit risk by financial institutions continued to cause a decrease in the availability of credit for mattress retailers 
we continue to actively monitor the financial condition of our customers to determine the potential for any nonpayment of trade receivables 
in determining our reserve for bad debts  we also consider other general economic factors 
our management believes that our process of specific review of customers  combined with overall analytical review provides a reliable evaluation of ultimate collectibility of trade receivables 
we recorded a bad debt provision of million  or approximately percent of sales  in fiscal provisions for bad debts recorded in fiscal and were million approximately of sales and million approximately of sales  respectively 
warranties and product returns at the time revenue is recognized  the company provides for the estimated costs of warranties and reduces revenue for estimated returns based on historical return experience for warrantable and other product returns 
we utilize warranty trends on existing similar product in order to estimate future warranty claims associated with newly introduced product 
changes in the historical trends of these returns could impact the estimates for future periods 
during fiscal  the company reviewed its computation of reserves for warrantable product returns and refined the calculations of these reserves in order to better predict the company s future liability related to these claims 
the effect of this change in estimate for warranty claims was to reduce other accrued liabilities and cost of sales by approximately million 
share based compensation plans we have two share based compensation plans  as described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for new awards issued and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled  the cost is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of the grant  and compensation expense is recognized for those awards earned over the service period 
certain of the equity awards vest based upon the company achieving certain adjusted ebitda performance targets 
during the service period  management estimates whether or not the adjusted ebitda performance targets will be met in order to determine the vesting period for those awards and what amount of compensation cost should be recognized related to these awards 
at the date of grant  we determine the fair value of the awards using the black scholes option pricing formula  the trinomial lattice model or the closing price of the company s common stock  as appropriate under the circumstances 
management estimates the period of time the employee will hold the option prior to exercise and the expected volatility of sealy corporation s stock  each of which impacts the fair value of the stock options 
the fair value of restricted shares and restricted share units is based upon the closing price of the company s common stock as of the grant date 
we also estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited based on the historical forfeiture rates experienced for our outstanding awards 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for certain losses related to medical claims with excess loss coverage of  per claim per year 
we also utilize large deductible policies to insure claims related to general liability  product liability  automobile  and workers compensation 
our recorded liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated workers compensation liability is discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and is reviewed by us and third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while management believes these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  medical cost inflation  or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results of operations could be impacted 
as of november  and november   million and million of the recorded liability for workers compensation was included as a component of other accrued liabilities and million and million was included as a component of other noncurrent liabilities within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  respectively impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
we assess recoverability using several methodologies  including the present value of estimated future cash flows and comparisons of multiples of enterprise values to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the analysis is based upon available information regarding expected future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted at rates consistent with the cost of capital specific to the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the indicated fair value of the reporting unit  a second analysis is performed to allocate the fair value to all assets and liabilities 
if  based on the second analysis  it is determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  goodwill is considered impaired 
our fiscal annual evaluation for goodwill impairment indicated a potential impairment of the goodwill for our argentina reporting unit 
as a result  we estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill in this reporting unit compared to carrying amounts and recorded an impairment charge of million to impair the entire balance of goodwill recorded in the argentina reporting unit 
the impairment charge is based upon the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the total carrying value of our goodwill was million and million at november  and november   respectively 
based on the results of our annual impairment testing  the fair value of the reporting units that maintain goodwill balances at november  significantly exceeded their carrying value 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings  claims  and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
a negative outcome of these matters is considered remote  and management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes we record an income tax valuation allowance when the realization of certain deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  is not more likely than not 
these deferred tax items represent expenses recognized for financial reporting purposes  which may result in tax deductions in the future 
certain judgments  assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of the valuation allowance and income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements 
our net deferred tax assets at november  were million  net of a million valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when  in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become available 
because the judgment about the level of future taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may  at least in part  be beyond our controls  it is at least reasonably possible that management s judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our federal  state and foreign tax positions and in the determination of our tax provision 
despite our belief that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate  it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of any particular tax matters 
we may adjust these liabilities as relevant circumstances evolve  such as guidance from the relevant tax authority  our tax advisors  or resolution of issues in the courts 
these adjustments are recognized as a component of income tax expense entirely in the period in which they are identified

year ended november  compared with year ended november  net sales 
our consolidated net sales for the year ended november  were  million  an increase of million  or from the year ended november  this increase was primarily related to our south american  mexico and us operations and was partially offset by sales decreases in canada 
total us net sales increased million to million from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the us net sales increase of million was attributable primarily to a increase in wholesale unit volume  coupled with a decrease in wholesale average unit selling price 
the increase in unit volume was primarily attributable to the performance of our sealy branded and next generation posturepedic lines and was partially offset by unit declines in the stearns foster and embody lines 
revenue gains from next generation posturepedic  sealy branded innerspring and embody products were partially offset by declines in stearns foster innerspring and embody latex products 
international net sales increased million  or from fiscal to million 
this increase was primarily attributable to the strong performance of our south american and mexico operations where we continue to see steady growth 
in canada  local currency sales decreases of translated into decreases of in us dollars due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
local currency sales decreases in our canadian market were driven by a decrease in unit volume and a decrease in average unit selling price 
the decrease in unit volume was the result of a weak canadian retail environment and a shift in the promotional calendar with our major customers which caused lower sales at their retail locations 
the decline in average unit selling price was driven by increases in incentives to our customers to drive higher unit volume in light of the slower retail environment 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  a decrease of million compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit in fiscal decreased percentage points to 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to decreases in gross profit margins in our us and canadian operations 
us gross profit decreased million to million or of net sales  which is a decrease of percentage points of net sales from the prior year period 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in raw material costs due in part to inflation pressures on the underlying commodities 
also contributing to this decrease were certain costs related to the launch of our next generation posturepedic line 
these increases were partially offset by continued improvements in operating efficiencies and value engineering efforts 
the local currency gross profit margin in canada was as a percentage of net sales which represents a decrease of percentage points from fiscal this decrease was driven primarily by the decline in average unit selling price as we and our customers sought to stimulate demand 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses were for fiscal compared with for fiscal the primary changes in selling  general and administrative expenses between fiscal and were as follows increase decrease outbound delivery cooperative advertising promotional costs bad debt volume driven variable expenses product launch costs national advertising incentive compensation and defined contribution expense other fixed operating expenses non cash compensation other total selling  general and administrative expense change the increases in cooperative advertising promotional costs  product launch costs and national advertising were significantly impacted in fiscal by the introduction of our next generation posturepedic line and the acceleration of the rollout of our next generation stearns foster product line during the fourth quarter of fiscal delivery costs have seen increases due to higher diesel prices through much of fiscal royalty income  net of royalty expense 
our consolidated royalty income  net of royalty expense  for fiscal increased million to million from fiscal primarily due to increased royalties recognized related to international licenses  including the new europe and brazil license arrangements 
interest expense 
our consolidated interest expense in fiscal increased by million from the prior year period to million 
our weighted average borrowing costs for fiscal and were and  respectively 
our borrowing cost in was unfavorably impacted by increases in non cash interest related to the pik and beneficial conversion features of our outstanding convertible notes 
this increase was partially offset by decreased cash interest expense which was primarily driven by the redemption of million of outstanding senior notes during fiscal we recognize non cash interest expense related to the pik interest on our outstanding convertible notes and the accretion or amortization of original issue discount and deferred debt issuance costs 
the table below provides a breakout of cash and non cash interest expense for fiscal and fiscal year cash interest expense non cash interest expense refinancing and extinguishment of debt and interest rate derivatives 
debt extinguishment and refinancing expenses for fiscal included non cash charges of million related to the write off of debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the million of senior notes that were repurchased 
also included was a cash charge of million which represents the premium that was paid to repurchase these notes 
debt extinguishment and refinancing expenses for fiscal included non cash charges of million related to the write off of debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the million of senior notes that were repurchased in the period 
also included was a cash charge of million which represents the premium that was paid to repurchase these notes 
income tax 
our effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
the effective rate for the fiscal period decreased primarily due to the consolidated pre tax net loss sustained by the company 
this decrease was also impacted by increases in non cash interest expense which was driven by the accretion of the beneficial conversion features in our convertible notes 
discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we divested the assets of our european manufacturing operations in france and italy which represented our europe segment 
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we discontinued our operations in brazil and transitioned to a license arrangement with third parties in this market 
we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations  and  accordingly  we have reclassified the results of operations and any losses resulting from disposition for all periods presented to reflect them as such 
amounts recognized in fiscal primarily include charges related to the continued liquidation of certain of the assets related to our brazil operations as well as charges for services performed in connection with the discontinuance of these operations 
amounts recognized in fiscal include an impairment charge of million and a loss on disposal of million

total us net sales increased million to million from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the us net sales increase of million was attributable primarily to a increase in wholesale unit volume  coupled with a decrease in wholesale average unit selling price 
the increase in unit volume was primarily attributable to the successful launch of our new stearns foster line which was partially offset by unit declines in other product lines 
the decrease in wholesale average unit selling price was due to our response to competitive pressures 
international net sales increased million  or from fiscal to million 
this increase was primarily attributable to the strong performance of our canadian operations 
in canada  local currency sales increases of translated into increases of in us dollars due to a higher average value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar during the first three quarters of fiscal local currency sales increases in our canadian market were driven by a increase in unit volume  partially offset by a decrease in average unit selling price 
the increase in unit volume was driven by the performance of our value oriented beds and the strength of our new stearns foster line 
the lower average unit selling price was driven primarily by strategic merchandising and promotional activity 
elsewhere in the company  we have experienced sales increases in our mexican and south american markets 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit in fiscal increased percentage points to 
the increase in percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in gross profit margins in our canadian operations 
us gross profit decreased million to million or of net sales  which is a decrease of percentage points of net sales from the prior year period 
the decrease as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to our response to competitive pressures and greater discounting on products that are near the end of their life cycle in anticipation of our new posturepedic product that was expected to be introduced in fiscal partially offsetting these decreases were improvements in operating efficiencies and value engineering efforts 
material costs did not have a significant impact on the results as lower costs in the first half of the year were offset as prices increased during the third and fourth quarters 
the local currency gross profit margin in canada was as a percentage of net sales which represents an increase of percentage points from fiscal this performance represents a return to historical levels and was driven by a reduction in material costs per unit due to currency fluctuations on raw material purchases  operational efficiencies and higher absorption of fixed manufacturing expenses due to increased sales volume 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses were consistent between fiscal and at 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a million increase in volume driven variable expenses primarily driven by a million increase in cooperative advertising and promotional costs 
fixed operating costs  exclusive of non cash compensation expense  decreased million from the prior year period primarily due to an million decrease in cash incentive based compensation costs and expected defined contribution plan payments 
these decreases were offset by increased product launch and advertising costs of million 
non cash compensation expense increased by million compared to fiscal due primarily to the recognition of expense related to the restricted share unit grants that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal goodwill impairment loss 
during fiscal  we recognized a total non cash charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill of our argentina reporting unit 
the impairment was indicated by our fiscal annual impairment testing of goodwill performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the goodwill impairment reflected a reduction in the fair value of argentina as a result of lower expected cash flows for the business and represents the entire goodwill balances for this reporting unit 
no such charges were recognized during fiscal restructuring expenses and asset impairment 
we recognized pretax restructuring costs of million during fiscal these charges primarily relate to the following actions in the second quarter of fiscal  management made the decision to cease manufacturing of certain foundation components and begin purchasing all of these components from third party suppliers 
as a result  we incurred certain insignificant costs related to one time terminations of employees 
additionally  we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million for the related equipment used in this manufacturing process that was not sold 
this plan was completed in the second quarter of fiscal no such restructuring charges were recognized in fiscal royalty income  net of royalty expense 
our consolidated royalty income  net of royalty expense  for fiscal increased million to million from fiscal primarily due to increased sales by our international licensees along with favorable fluctuations in international currency rates 
interest expense 
our consolidated interest expense in fiscal increased by million from the prior year period to million 
our weighted average borrowing costs for fiscal and were and  respectively 
our borrowing cost was unfavorably impacted by our refinancing which resulted in increased interest rates and outstanding debt balances 
we recognize non cash interest related to the pik interest on our outstanding convertible notes and the accretion or amortization of original issue discount and deferred debt issuance costs 
the table below provides a breakout of cash and non cash interest for fiscal and fiscal year in thousands cash interest expense non cash interest expense total interest expense refinancing and extinguishment of debt and interest rate derivatives 
debt extinguishment and refinancing expenses for fiscal included non cash charges of million related to the write off of debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with the million of senior notes that were repurchased this period 
also included was a cash charge of million which represents the premium that was paid to repurchase these notes 
debt extinguishment and refinancing expenses for fiscal includes non cash charges of million relating to the write off of debt issuance costs related to our old senior term loans 
additionally  we incurred million of charges associated with termination payments on our interest rate swap agreements that were associated with the old senior credit facility 
income tax 
our effective income tax rate generally differs from the federal statutory rate due to the effects of certain foreign tax rate differentials and state and local income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
the effective rate for the fiscal period increased primarily due to the effect of non deductible paid in kind interest which resulted from the refinancing in the second quarter of additionally  fiscal results included a larger benefit resulting from the release of more uncertain tax positions than were recognized in fiscal discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we divested the assets of our european manufacturing operations in france and italy which represented our europe segment 
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we discontinued our operations in brazil and transitioned to a license arrangement with third parties in this market 
we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations  and  accordingly  we have reclassified the results of operations and any losses resulting from disposition for all periods presented to reflect them as such 
amounts recognized in fiscal include an impairment charge of million and a loss on disposal of million 
liquidity and capital resources principal sources and uses of funds our principal sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our asset based revolving credit facility which provides commitments of up to million and matures in may the abl revolver 
no borrowings were made against the abl revolver during fiscal our principal use of funds consists of operating expenditures  payments of interest on our senior debt  capital expenditures  and interest payments on our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
capital expenditures totaled million for fiscal during fiscal  there was no significant spending for additional production capacity 
however  we did spend approximately million for capital items related to our next generation posturepedic line 
we believe that annual capital expenditure limitations in our current debt agreements will not prevent us from meeting our ongoing capital needs 
our introductions of new products typically require us to make initial cash investments in inventory  promotional supplies and employee training which may not be immediately recovered through new product sales 
however  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb such expenditures related to new products and that these expenses will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating cash flow which we believe to be sufficient to support our operations 
at november   we had approximately million available for borrowing under the abl revolver which represents the calculated borrowing base reduced by outstanding letters of credit of million 
we currently believe that our liquidity is adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements 
the calculated borrowing base under the abl revolver is determined based on our domestic accounts receivable and inventory balances 
our net weighted average borrowing cost was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under the abl revolver 
based on our current cash position and the availability of funds through our abl revolver  we believe that we will be able to obtain additional funds as necessary during fiscal in order to support our operations 
approximately million of our outstanding cash balance at november  was held in foreign jurisdictions 
while we are not prohibited from repatriating these funds to the us  the cost of doing so may be significant depending upon the prevailing tax rates 
however  since we have the intent and ability to reinvest these earnings  we have not provided for income taxes against the earnings of these subsidiaries 
debt our outstanding debt primarily consists of the following the abl revolver that provides commitments of up to million maturing in may  which bears interest at our choice of either a base rate determined by reference to the higher of several rates as defined by the abl revolver agreement or a libor rate for us dollar deposits plus an applicable margin of  million in original aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due april the senior notes  which bear interest at per annum payable semi annually  million in initial aggregate principal amount of senior secured convertible pik notes due july which are convertible into shares of the company s common stock the convertible notes and bear interest at per annum payable semi annually in the form of additional convertible notes  and an original million aggregate principal amount maturing june   bearing interest of per annum payable semi annually the notes 
at november  there were no amounts outstanding under the abl revolver 
the company did not borrow any amounts under this agreement during the course of fiscal the outstanding principal and carrying amounts at november  related to our outstanding notes are as follows principal amount carrying amount senior notes due convertible notes due senior subordinated notes due the carrying value of the senior notes gives effect to an unamortized original issue discount of million 
the carrying value of the convertible notes includes accrued pik interest and the effects of the accounting for the beneficial conversion features that were recognized upon each of the january and july interest payment dates since their issuance 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included in item for further details 
future interest payments are expected to be paid out of cash flows from operations and borrowings on our abl revolver 
the abl revolver provides for revolving credit financing  subject to borrowing base availability 
the borrowing base consists of the following of the net amount of eligible accounts receivable and the lesser of i of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory or ii of the net amount of eligible inventory 
these amounts are reduced by reserves deemed necessary by the lenders 
at november   there were no amounts outstanding under the abl revolver 
as part of our ongoing evaluation of our capital structure  we continually assess opportunities to reduce our debt  which opportunities may from time to time include the redemption or repurchase of a portion of our senior notes  the notes or the convertible notes to the extent permitted by our debt covenants 
during fiscal and  the company redeemed million and million  respectively  of the principal amount of its outstanding senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company repurchased and retired million aggregate principal amount of the notes on the open market at of par  plus accrued interest 
from november  to january   we redeemed an additional million of the outstanding senior notes at of par  plus accrued interest 
in addition  our board authorized a common stock repurchase program on february  under which we may repurchase up to million of our common stock 
as of november   we have repurchased shares for million under this program  none of which was repurchased during fiscal from november  through january   we did not repurchase any additional shares under this program 
we periodically repurchase shares of common stock in order to cover the minimum tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of restricted stock units 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  or to pay the interest or liquidated damages  if any  on or to refinance our indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we will be required to make scheduled principal payments of million during the next twelve months  with million for our financing obligations and capital leases and the remainder for debt owed by our international subsidiaries 
however  as we continually evaluate our ability to make additional prepayments as permitted under our abl revolver agreement and the indentures governing the senior notes  the convertible notes and the notes  it is possible that we will redeem or repurchase portions of our senior or subordinated debt during that time 
dividend our abl revolver agreement and the indentures governing the senior notes  the notes and the convertible notes contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends  including a requirement in the abl revolver agreement that we meet a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and restrictions as to the amount available for payment 
although we meet the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirement in our abl revolver agreement as of november   we do no meet the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio contained in the indentures governing the senior notes  convertible notes and notes as of november  our ability to pay a dividend to our common shareholders is currently limited to million under our note indentures and we do not currently expect a dividend will be declared in the first quarter of fiscal cash flow analysis the following table summarizes our changes in cash fiscal year in thousands statement of cash flow data cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents beginning of period end of period we use a week fiscal year ending on the closest sunday to november  but no later than december the fiscal years ended november   november  and november  were week years 
year ended november  compared with year ended november  cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flow from operations decreased million to a million net source of cash for the year ended november   compared to a million net source of cash for the year ended november  the decrease in net income  excluding non cash losses such as impairment charges  was the primary driver of the change in fiscal as compared with fiscal this decrease has been partially offset by an improvement in working capital as cash used for working capital in fiscal decreased by million compared with fiscal this increase has been driven primarily by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  which have been driven by lower sales levels in fiscal cash flows used in investing activities 
our cash flows used in investing activities increased approximately million from fiscal primarily due to higher capital expenditures in fiscal related to equipment purchases used in the production of our next generation posturepedic product 
cash flows used in financing activities 
our cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended november  was million compared with cash used in financing activities in fiscal of million 
this decrease has been driven primarily by the level of redemptions of our senior notes in fiscal compared to fiscal which included redemptions of million and million  respectively 
year ended november  compared with year ended november  cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flow from operations decreased million to a million net source of cash for the year ended november   compared to a million net source of cash for the year ended november  cash used for working capital in fiscal increased by million compared with fiscal this decrease has been driven primarily by higher inventory levels due to changes in the sourcing of certain product  higher incentive compensation payments made in fiscal and the receipt of million of income tax refunds during fiscal these decreases have been partially offset by higher net income after adjustments for the loss on disposition of the european and brazilian business  non cash interest and non cash compensation 
cash flows used in investing activities 
our cash flows used in investing activities increased approximately million from fiscal primarily due to higher capital expenditures in fiscal in addition to the million of proceeds from the sale leaseback of our south gate  california facility received in fiscal cash flows used in financing activities 
our cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended november  was million compared with cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million 
this significant use of cash in fiscal has been primarily driven by the redemption of million of senior notes whereas the refinancing provided approximately million of cash after considering the effects of the payments of costs to issue our new debt in fiscal debt covenants the covenants contained within our debt agreements are based on what we refer to herein as adjusted ebitda 
in the debt agreements and indentures  adjusted ebitda is defined as net income plus interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance 
adjusted ebitda is presented herein as it is a material component of these covenants 
additionally  management uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate the company s operating performance and we believe that this measure provides useful incremental information to investors regarding our operating performance 
while the determination of unusual items is subject to interpretation and requires judgment  we believe the adjustments listed below are in accordance with the covenants 
adjusted ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  it is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments  tax payments and debt service requirements 
because not all companies use identical calculations  these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and ebitda to adjusted ebitda for the years ended november   november   and november  in thousands net loss income interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda adjustments for debt covenants refinancing charges non cash compensation kkr consulting fees severance charges goodwill impairment restructuring and impairment related charges loss on written option derivative discontinued operations other various a adjusted ebitda a consists of various immaterial adjustments 
events of default our long term obligations contain various financial tests and covenants but do not require that we meet quarterly financial ratio targets in order to maintain compliance with the terms of the obligations unless we are in a minimum availability period under the terms of our abl revolver 
our abl revolver requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of to in periods of minimum availability where the availability for two consecutive calendar days is less than the greater of of the total commitment under the abl revolver and million 
as of november   we were not in a period of minimum availability and did not have any outstanding borrowings under the abl revolver 
non compliance with the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in a period of minimum availability could result in the requirement to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the abl revolver 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is defined by the abl revolver agreement as the ratio of adjusted ebitda less unfinanced capital expenditures and net cash taxes paid to fixed charges which include cash payments for interest  capital lease obligations  scheduled principal payments on debt and other restricted payments 
restrictions on certain transactions the covenants contained in our debt agreements and indentures also restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions the most significant of which are summarized below 
our abl revolver requires us to meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to in order to make certain restricted payments including dividend distributions to holders of our common stock  dividends or distributions to the parent company sealy corporation  and debt repayments  subject to certain exceptions 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is defined by the abl revolver agreement as the ratio of adjusted ebitda less unfinanced capital expenditures and net cash paid to fixed charges which include cash payments for interest  capital lease obligations  scheduled principal payments on debt and restricted payments 
at november   adjustments to adjusted ebitda for cash taxes paid and unfinanced capital expenditures were million 
fixed charges as calculated under the terms of the abl revolver agreement were million 
this results in a fixed charge coverage ratio of to at november  under the terms of the abl revolver agreement 
the indentures governing our senior notes  convertible notes and notes also require us to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of to in order to incur additional indebtedness and make certain restricted payments  including dividends or equity distributions  subject to certain exceptions 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is defined by the indentures related to these notes as the ratio of adjusted ebitda to fixed charges which include interest expense  and cash dividend payments on certain preferred stock 
at november   fixed charges as calculated under the terms of the indentures governing our senior notes  convertible notes and notes were million  resulting in a fixed charge coverage ratio of to 
although we meet the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirements contained in our abl revolver agreement  we do not meet the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio contained in the indentures governing the senior notes  convertible notes and notes as of november  as such  sealy mattress company and its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to incur additional new indebtedness and make certain restricted payments  including dividends or equity distributions other than pursuant to specified exceptions 
we do not believe that these restrictions will impact our liquidity or our ability to meet our ongoing capital needs 
as of and during the fiscal years ended november   november   and november   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in our debt agreements 
these agreements also restrict our ability to pay dividends and repurchase common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we occupy premises and utilize equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the obligations under those leases are not recorded on our balance sheet 
many of these leases provide for payment of certain expenses and contain renewal and purchase options 
during the fiscal years ended november   november   and november   we recognized lease expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
we are involved in a group of joint ventures to develop markets for sealy branded products in asia 
these joint ventures are not considered to be variable interest entities and are therefore not consolidated for financial statement purposes 
we account for our interest in the joint ventures under the equity method  and our net investment of million is recorded as a component of other assets including debt issuance costs  net within the consolidated balance sheet at november  we believe that any possible commitments arising from these joint ventures will not be significant to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in connection with the sale of our european manufacturing operations  we made certain guarantees with respect to the existence of liabilities and deficiencies related to assets as of the closing date that were not reflected in the european business financial statements as of the closing date 
further  certain guarantees were made with respect to losses or damages incurred by the purchaser related to any misrepresentations or warranties made by us  outstanding disputes or judicial proceedings 
such guarantees are limited to an aggregate amount of million million under the terms of the contract 
as of november  we have been notified of several outstanding contingencies that would be covered by this guarantee and have recorded a liability of approximately million million 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as previously discussed  our debt at november  consisted of an asset based revolving credit facility  under which no amounts were outstanding  million of senior notes due  million of convertible paid in kind notes due  million outstanding aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due  million due on our financing obligations and an additional million of other borrowings  most of which are owed by our international subsidiaries 
the outstanding balance of the convertible notes indicated above includes accrued pik interest and the effects of the accounting for the beneficial conversion features that were recognized upon each of the january th and july th interest payment dates since the issuance of these notes 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included in item for further details 
we periodically engage in various hedging activities in order to mitigate the risk of variability in future cash flows resulting from projected foreign currency and commodity purchase requirements 
accordingly  we have entered into contractual arrangements for foreign currency forward and option contracts  and fixed price swap agreements for diesel fuel 
the related assets and liabilities associated with the fair value of such derivative instruments are recorded on our balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in our income statement  except for those associated with those agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our federal  state and foreign tax positions and in the determination of our tax provision 
despite our belief that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate  it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter 
we may adjust these liabilities as relevant circumstances evolve  such as guidance from the relevant tax authority  or resolution of issues in the courts 
these adjustments are recognized as a component of income tax expense entirely in the period in which they are identified 
while we are currently undergoing examinations of certain of our corporate income tax returns by tax authorities  no issues related to these liabilities for uncertain tax positions have been presented to us and we have not been informed that such audits will result in an assessment or payment of taxes related to these positions during the one year period following november  in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions 
at november   the entire net reserve for uncertain tax positions was million and million as a reduction of non current deferred tax asset including penalties and interest 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
as such  the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities are not included in the table below 
our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of november  are summarized below in thousands contractual obligations after total obligations principal maturities of long term debt projected interest on long term debt projected cash flows on derivatives operating leases other total other commercial commitments after total commitments standby letters of credit million of our outstanding debt at november  is subject to variable interest rates 
interest payments are projected based on rates in effect at november  assuming no variable rate fluctuations going forward 
an increase in the interest rates applicable to the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt by would result in an insignificant amount of additional annual cash interest expense 
further  these amounts include the paid in kind interest obligation related to our convertible notes which does not represent a cash interest payment 
our hedging instruments consist of the projected net settlements of our and foreign currency and commodity contracts as of november  based on the expected timing of the net payments to be received under the agreements and have not been included in the above presentation as they do not currently represent obligations of the company 
the fair value of these instruments can fluctuate based on market conditions 
obligations under operating leases include only projected payments under current lease terms  excluding renewal options and assuming no exercise of any purchase options 
we issue letters of credit in the ordinary course of business primarily to back our various obligations under workers compensation and other insurance programs  environmental liabilities  and open positions on certain of our derivative instruments 
these obligations will renew automatically on an annual basis unless cancelled per our instructions 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  we have an million long term obligation arising from underfunded pension plans 
future minimum pension funding requirements are not included in the schedule above as they are not available for all periods presented 
during fiscal  we estimate that we will make approximately million in contributions to the plans 
in fiscal  we contributed million into the plans 
there are no agreements to purchase goods or services with fixed or minimum obligations 
the schedule above does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business 
foreign operations and export sales we operate three manufacturing and distribution center facilities in canada  and one each in mexico  argentina  and uruguay 
we participate in a group of joint ventures with our australian licensee to import  manufacture  distribute and sell sealy branded products in south east asia 
on december   a fifty percent interest in our operations in south korea was sold for million to our australian licensee and these operations became part of the joint venture 
on december   the company and its australian licensee each acquired a interest in a joint venture that owns the assets of our former new zealand licensee 
the purchase price for the ownership was million 
additional contributions of million were made by each party to the joint venture to fund the initial working capital of this entity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for further details 
we also export products directly into many small international markets  and have license agreements in australia thailand  japan  the united kingdom  continental european union countries  brazil  columbia  paraguay  india  south africa  israel  jamaica  saudi arabia and the dominican republic 
during fiscal  we divested the assets of our european manufacturing operations in france and italy which represented our europe segment 
also during  we discontinued our operations in brazil and transitioned to a license arrangement with third parties in this market 
we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations  and  accordingly  we have reclassified the selected financial data for all periods presented to reflect them as such 
impact of recently issued authoritative accounting guidance in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which modifies the requirements of step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal the company is still assessing the potential impact of adoption 
fiscal year we use a week fiscal year ending on the closest sunday to november  but no later than december the fiscal years ended november   november  and november  were week years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposures our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of our subsidiaries functional currencies as compared to the currencies of our foreign denominated purchases 
foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to hedge against a portion of the earnings and cash flow effects of such fluctuations 
the result of a uniform change in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies of countries in which we manufacture or sell our products would have an approximate million dollar impact on our financial position for the year ended november  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate for our largest international markets would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar and is based on fiscal year net income loss in these markets 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations for license revenue  some of which is denominated in foreign currencies 
to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from purchases in a foreign currency  we have instituted a forecasted cash flow hedging program 
we hedge portions of our purchases denominated in foreign currencies and royalty payments to third parties with forward contracts 
at november   we had outstanding forward and option foreign currency contracts to sell canadian dollars for a total of million us dollars 
the expiration dates for the canadian dollar contracts range from december to november at november   the fair value of these contracts was an asset of million 
the changes in fair value of the foreign currency hedges are included in net income  except for those contracts that have been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
for contracts designated as hedges for accounting purposes  the changes in fair value related to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk prior to the refinancing and the disposition of the european operations  the company was exposed to interest rate risk associated with fluctuations in the interest rates on its variable interest rate debt 
however  the majority of our outstanding debt bears interest at fixed rates  thereby reducing our interest rate risk 
we periodically utilize interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk related to fluctuations in variable interest rates associated with our outstanding debt instruments 
through the refinancing and the disposition of our europe segment  these interest rate swap agreements were terminated and at november   no such agreements were outstanding 
based on the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding at november   a basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates would have an insignificant impact on our annual interest expense 
commodity price risks during fiscal  the prices paid for steel  latex and polyurethane foams increased from prior year levels and stabilized somewhat due to a reduction in the volatility in the related commodity prices during the fourth quarter of we periodically enter into commodity based physical contracts to buy natural gas at agreed upon fixed prices 
these contracts are entered into in the normal course of business 
during fiscal and  we entered into a forecasted cash flow hedging program through which we hedge a portion of our expected diesel fuel consumption through the use of fixed price swap contracts 
these contracts reduce our exposure to the volatility in diesel fuel prices 
at november   we had contracts outstanding for million gallons of diesel fuel to be consumed through november  at november   we had contracts outstanding for million gallons of diesel fuel to be consumed through january
