renegotiated alaska crude oil sales contract on march   we entered into a crude oil sales agreement with an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products whereby that company agreed to purchase all crude oil produced by us  subject to a minimum of bbls day and a maximum of  bbls day 
the agreement strategically aligned the terms of our pricing with the ans index  which has historically averaged approximately higher per barrel than wti  as defined below 
the newly negotiated price for each delivery of oil is equal to the higher of the arithmetic average of the published daily new york mercantile exchange nymex settlement prices for light sweet crude oil delivered at cushing  oklahoma wti for the applicable front month nymex contract published each business day in the calendar month of delivery or the ans index midpoint price if it is at least barrel greater than the wti index price  subject to certain adjustments 
under the agreement  we are also responsible for paying taxes on the sale or on production or handling of the oil prior to delivery 
the contract may be opened for renegotiation if the quality of the oil changes  certain volume reductions or increases  changes to the cook inlet spill prevention and response  inc cispri charges  or closure of the purchaser s alaska refinery 

table of contents geographic area overview we currently focus our efforts on activities in the cook inlet and susitna basins of alaska as well as the appalachian region of east tennessee 
the following table sets forth certain key information for each of our operating areas 
additional data and discussion is provided in part ii  item of this form k 
production percentage of total production oil and gas revenues estimated proved reserves percentage of total estimated proved reserves in boe in thousands in mboe cook inlet appalachian region total cook inlet production excludes  boe of fuel gas 
alaska region overview the cook inlet basin contains large oil and gas deposits including multiple offshore fields 
in there were platforms in the cook inlet  the oldest of which is the xto a platform first installed by royal dutch shell plc in  and the newest of which is the osprey platform installed by forest oil corporation in  and acquired by us in december southcentral alaska has a well developed oil and gas pipeline infrastructure to bring cook inlet oil and gas to market 
this system is isolated from the main north american gas pipeline system 
much of the value added hydrocarbon processing occurs on the east side of cook inlet in an industrial cluster located in nikiski  which is the northern part of the city of kenai 
the tesoro refinery  conocophillips lng plant  bp gtl plant  agrium  inc fertilizer plant  and numerous docks  tanks and pipelines are all located in nikiski 
the susitna basin is a large area to the north of anchorage in southcentral alaska 
it is perhaps best known for its coal seams in the sedimentary basin that lies underneath the basin and could become a new source of much needed natural gas 
cook inlet and susitna basins the cook inlet is a vast estuary stretching miles from the gulf of alaska to anchorage in southcentral alaska 
the inlet separates the kenai peninsula in the east from the alaska peninsula in the west 
the cook inlet basin underlying this region contains large oil and gas deposits including several offshore fields 
there are also numerous oil and gas pipelines located in and under the cook inlet 
the cook inlet basin has produced approximately billion barrels of oil and trillion cubic feet tcf of natural gas 
the susitna basin underlies the sprawling susitna river valley to the north of anchorage 
the susitna basin lies directly north of the cook inlet basin  separated by the castle mountain fault  and has similar geology 
while the cook inlet basin is a historic region of oil and gas production  there is not currently commercial production of oil or gas from the susitna basin 
in its assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources of the cook inlet region  the united states geologic survey usgs estimated mean undiscovered technically recoverable reserves of million bbls of oil and tcf of natural gas 
all of the undiscovered oil and tcf of the undiscovered gas are conventional resources  tcf of natural gas was estimated to be technically recoverable as coal bed methane 
this report considered the full oil and gas potential of the cook inlet basin  but only the coal bed methane potential of the susitna basin 
these numbers do not include oil and gas remaining to be produced in currently producing fields 
as of april  and  we owned approximately  and  gross acres of leasehold interests  the exploration license rights to an additional  acres and interests in crude oil and five natural gas wells 
the reduction in leased acreage from april  is a result of our surrender of five leases nearing expiration and the assignment of a portion of one lease to union oil company of california unocal 
the increase in license acreage resulted from the issuance of susitna basin exploration license no 
 consisting of  acres 
at the time we acquired the alaskan operations  all ten oil wells  three of four gas wells and four injection wells were shut in 
by april   three oil wells and five gas wells had been returned to production 
in addition  we own a working interest in two gas wells operated by aurora gas  which have been operated continuously 

table of contents oil wells drilled in this area range from  vertical feet to  feet in vertical depth while gas wells have a vertical depth of  feet to  feet 
wells that are deviated continue on from the vertical depth either diagonally or horizontally will have a longer measured depth of approximately  feet giving total measured depth of  feet to  feet 
well spacing is quite variable  as there are large parts of cook inlet which are completely undeveloped and others that are more mature 
our fields have approximately to acre spacing 
the cook inlet basin contains a thick section of terrestrial tertiary rocks which includes shale  sandstone  and coal 
the primary targets in the area are crude oil reserves  but prolific gas fields are increasingly attractive due to the rising price of gas in the alaska market and liquefied natural gas lng 
cook inlet natural gas is strategically situated to provide lng to asian markets where the lng price is high and rising 
the nikiski lng plant is the only lng export facility in the united states  and has been shipping cook inlet lng to japan for over years 
osprey platform and redoubt shoals field the osprey platform is located in the redoubt unit approximately miles southeast of the west foreland in central cook inlet at a water depth of approximately feet 
the osprey platform  which produces from the redoubt shoals field is connected to our kustatan production facility 
it relies on our kustatan production facility and our west mcarthur river unit production facility to provide all of its electricity and gas  and the kustatan production facility to process all of osprey s produced fluids 
the platform has slots  eight of which are currently used  and an attached man camp 
after a period of inactivity  we started work to re commission osprey in february and restored production in may the osprey platform was placed on site in june and initially used to conduct exploration drilling operations between january and july eight wells were drilled  which in their present configuration consist of one water flood well  one class i injection well  and six oil wells 
the oil wells were equipped with electrical submersible pumps esps which were necessary to bring the oil to surface 
in  the third party drilling rig was removed from the platform after a contract dispute 
the removal of the rig delayed the ability to maintain and repair the platform s wells or to expand production  and the osprey platform was shut in in the spring of in order to restore production from the redoubt unit  it was necessary to mobilize a drilling rig to the osprey platform to repair the shut in wells 
two of the wells required replacement of the esps  but the other four wells required re drilling in sections 
due to significant drilling rig rental cost and delays associated with mobilization and availability of a drilling rig sufficient in size and power to repair the wells  we determined it was most effective to permanently locate a drilling rig on the osprey platform 
we estimated the total cost of restoring full production  including the purchase and construction of a drilling rig  to be approximately million 
in march  we transitioned the osprey platform out of lighthouse mode and successfully repaired the first of the two wells needing esp replacement  of which one later failed in september as a result of successive pump failure 
in june  we contracted with voorhees equipment and consulting  inc for the custom construction and purchase of rig for million 
we successfully mobilized all components of the custom rig to the osprey platform in late december assembly of the rig began as parts were delivered to the platform 
in january  the region experienced prolonged  near record cold weather  which caused us to temporarily delay rig assembly efforts due to safety concerns 
the cold weather also led to significant generation of ice volume in the cook inlet and made shipping and the operation of work boats impossible 
as warmer temperatures moderated the region  we resumed work on the assembly of rig  which in its present state is substantially completed and expected to be fully operational in july kustatan production facility the kustatan production facility was constructed in by forest oil corporation to process an estimated  bopd 
processing capabilities are expandable to  bopd 
the facility provides power and processes hydrocarbons produced from our offshore osprey platform 
west mcarthur river field and production facility the west mcarthur river facility processes oil and gas from the west mcarthur river field and has the ability to process gas from the west foreland field 
currently  there are three producing wells in the field 
the facility was built in s to process approximately  bopd 
west foreland field and production facility the west foreland field is produced through the west foreland facility but can be processed through the west mcarthur river facility 
currently  there are three wells in the field  one of which is off line 
the west foreland facility is tied into the gas pipeline network including sales gas pipelines 
three mile creek field the three mile creek field is operated by aurora gas 
there are two gas wells in which we own a working 
table of contents interest in this field 
susitna basin included in the alaskan operations we acquired is a interest in susitna basin exploration license no 
 granted by the state of alaska in october covering approximately  acres in the susitna basin area north of anchorage 
under the terms of the exploration license  the licensee was granted a seven year exclusive license to explore for oil and gas on the specified lands  and upon fulfillment of the work commitment  the license for all or any part of the land could be converted into oil and gas leases 
the original work commitment of approximately million was fulfilled 
in an effort to control the timing of the development of this acreage  in april we requested a three year extension of the exploration license for a work commitment of million 
the state granted the extension in october we will have the right to convert all or any portion of the licensed acreage into oil and gas leases upon completion of the new work commitment 
on april   we were awarded susitna basin exploration license no 
 which consists of  acres 
it granted us an exclusive ten year license to explore for oil and gas on the specified lands 
upon fulfillment of a million work commitment  we will gain the option to convert any part of the licensed area into oil and gas leases 
we posted an initial performance bond of million toward fulfilling its work commitment  and will need to post additional bonds annually if no work is carried out in the licensed area

assignment oversight agreement on november   cie entered into an assignment oversight agreement with the alaska department of natural resources alaska dnr which set out certain terms under which the alaska dnr would approve the assignment of certain specified state oil and gas leases from pacific energy resources to cie 
this agreement remains in place following our acquisition of cie in december generally  the agreement requires cie to provide the alaska dnr with additional information and oversight authority to ensure that cie is acting diligently to develop the oil and gas reserves from the redoubt shoal  west mcarthur river and west foreland fields 
under the terms of the agreement  until the alaska dnr determines  in its sole discretion  that cie has completed its development and operation obligations under the assigned leases cie agreed to the following file a monthly summary of expenditures by oil and gas field  tied to objectives in cie s business plan and plan of development previously presented to the alaska dnr  meet monthly with the alaska dnr to provide an update on operations and progress towards meeting these objectives  notify the alaska dnr days prior to commitment when cie is preparing to spend funds on a purchase  project or item of more than million during the first months  more than million during the second months and more than million thereafter  and submit a new plan of development and plan of operations for the alaska dnr s approval on or before december  and submit a plan of development annually thereafter on or before february  cie timely met these deadlines 
the agreement required cie to obtain financing in the minimum amount of million to provide funds to be used for expenditures approved by the alaska dnr as part of cie s plan of development 
we have provided these funds for the west mcarthur river facility using a portion of the proceeds of our capital raising efforts described elsewhere herein 
the agreement required cie to demonstrate funding commitments to support restoration of the base production at the redoubt unit  including bringing a number of the shut in wells back on line  which was estimated at million in the agreement  but which we have internally increased to million primarily to accommodate the contractual purchase price of a drilling rig 
cie is prohibited from using any of the proceeds from the operations under the assigned leases of the funding commitments for non core oil and gas activities under the assigned leases  or any activities outside the assigned leases  without the prior written approval of the alaska dnr until the parties mutually agree that the full dismantlement obligation under the assigned leases is funded 
on march   cie entered into a performance bond agreement with the alaska dnr that applies to the offshore obligations under the assignment oversight agreement 
under the performance bond agreement  cie is required to post a total bond of million  however  the performance bond agreement makes clear that approximately million held 
table of contents by the state will apply to the total bond required 
the first payment of million toward the bonding requirement is due in july the assigned leases will be subject to default and termination should cie fail to submit the information required under the agreement and expenditure of funds for items or activities do not support core oil and gas activities  as reasonably determined by the alaska dnr 
membership in cook inlet spill prevention and response  inc cie is a member of the cispri 
cispri is a non profit corporation formed in to provide oil spill prevention and response capabilities in cook inlet 
cispri has been designated as a class e oil spill removal organization by the us coast guard  which is the highest level of designation based on spill containment and removal equipment requirements for offshore ocean response 
cispri s response zone includes the entire cook inlet region 
at each annual meeting of cispri members adopt a budget for the coming year which includes funds for day to day operational activities of cispri  investments in capital equipment and materials to be used in connection with the cleanup activities and research and development and training 
the budget is funded though payment of dues by the members and the amount of dues is calculated in accordance with a participation formula 
we pay an annual fee of  together with additional fees based upon the amount of oil we transport 
if a spill of crude oil synthetic crude oil or refined petroleum products is identified as originating from facilities owned or operations conducted by one or more of the members  cispri will act to control and clean up the spill without any further action by the members 
any member that utilizes or receives the benefit of these activities must reimburse cispri for all expenses of control and clean up  including costs of equipment  materials and personnel 
each member is required to execute a response action contract providing terms and conditions under which response and cleanup activities will be undertaken

cie is in compliance with these insurance requirements 
all members accept responsibility for spills which result from their operations or facilities and have indemnified cispri and all other members for all liabilities arising for a spill 
this indemnification is not limited by the amount of insurance coverage 
cie may resign its membership in cispri upon days written notice 
at the effective date of the resignation  cie is obligated to pay all unpaid dues and assessments levied prior to the notice of resignation 
cie s membership may be terminated by the board of directors of cispri upon days notice if it s determined cie is no longer eligible for membership 
cie would not be entitled to a refund of any monies paid to cispri 
appalachian region we are the largest owner operator of oil and natural gas wells in tennessee 
as of april   we owned approximately  gross acres of leasehold interests with producing oil wells and producing gas wells in which we own an interest 
wells drilled within our acreage range from approximately  to  feet in depth with major targets in descending order being the mississippian age monteagle limestone and fort payne limestone  and the devonian age chattanooga shale  with the fort payne limestone being the primary oil target 
the appalachian region of tennessee has produced oil from a number of fields 
some of those fields include the indian creek  burrville  low gap  lick branch  gum branch  skull creek  and bendix spur 
we have acreage in and around these previously producing fields and plan to utilize our expertise to enhance present production and extract additional oil from areas previously overlooked 
historically  only percent to percent of the oil in place has been recovered by primary recovery methods in the mississipian age formations of the monteagle limestone and fort payne limestone in tennessee 
we believe that horizontal drilling within our acreage holdings described above will unlock much of the oil still in place 
horizontal drilling is the process of drilling a well from the surface to a subsurface location just above the target formation called the kickoff point  then deviating the well bore from the vertical plane around a curve to intersect the formation at the entry point with a near horizontal inclination 
at this point  the well bore remains in the horizontal plane until the desired length is achieved 
with the monteagle and fort payne being stratigraphic oil producing zones  horizontal drilling will be a way to recover a much greater percentage of the remaining oil in place by placing the well bore within the stratigraphic zone and not drilling through the zone vertically 
this drilling and production method along with gas pressure maintenance will enable us to maximize the oil potential in tennessee 
another focus for the appalachian region is the potential extraction from the devonian age chattanooga shale 
across the us  from the west coast to the northeast  some geographic basins are recognized sources of shale gas 
although natural gas has been known for years to exist in these formations  the natural gas trapped in it was not considered commercially viable to produce because of shale s tendency to be so dense that the trapped natural gas could not be accessed 
the 
table of contents introduction of horizontal drilling and multiple zone hydraulic fracturing has allowed for this untapped resource to become commercially viable 
as is the case above with the horizontal drilling in the mississippian limestone formations  along this horizontal lateral  multiple zone hydraulic fracturing breaks open the shale to allow natural gas to flow freely to the well bore 
this horizontal approach to accessing the hydrocarbons trapped within the shale formation has proven to be more cost effective than traditional vertical drilling while minimizing the number of wells necessary to monetize a formation 
currently  within the acreage controlled by us  there are numerous potential well locations that can be drilled and produced to be used as a pressure maintenance program or natural gas storage within the mississippian age fort payne limestone 
principal markets and customers the existing markets for natural gas production in southcentral alaska are the tesoro nikiski refinery  utility companies  petrochemical manufacturing  the production of lng for export to asian markets  and the production of synthetic crude oil syncrude 
presently  our sole market for crude oil produced from our alaskan operations is the tesoro nikiski refinery 
crude oil is shipped by pipeline and tanker vessel to the tesoro nikiski refinery  operated by tesoro alaska petroleum company tesoro 
under the terms of the alaska crude oil sales contract  tesoro has agreed to purchase all crude oil produced by us  subject to a minimum of bbls day and a maximum of  bbls day 
should the quantity of oil produced by us fall below the minimum or rise above the maximum  the contract would be open for renegotiation 
the price for each delivery of oil shall be equal to the simple arithmetic average of the published daily nymex wti for the applicable front month nymex contract published each business day in the calendar month of delivery  subject to certain adjustments i if the ans index midpoint price is at least barrel greater than the wti index price  then the price shall be equal to the ans index midpoint price less bbl  ii if the ans index midpoint price is equal to or less than the sum of the wti index price plus barrel  then the price shall be equal to the wti index price less  iii less a deduction for the cispri  iv less a deduction for transportation through the kenai pipeline  v less a deduction for transportation and shipping  and  vi less a deduction adjusting for redoubt shoal quality 
non redoubt shoal oil will have an additional quality adjustment 
we are also responsible for paying taxes on the sale or on production or handling of the oil prior to delivery 
the contract may be opened for renegotiation if the quality of the oil changes  certain volume reductions or increases  changes to the cispri charges  or closure of the company s alaska refinery 
in fiscal  and  purchases by tesoro accounted for   and  respectively  of our total alaska oil and gas production revenues 
currently  all natural gas produced by our alaskan operations is used to generate heat and power at our production facilities 
at such time as gas production exceeds our internal needs  we can sell the excess production as all of our gas wells are connected to the southcentral alaska railbelt pipeline network through the cook inlet gas gathering system and or the beluga pipeline  both of which are operated by marathon pipelines 
the principal markets for our crude oil and natural gas produced in the appalachian region are refining companies  utility companies and private industry end users 
crude oil is stored in tanks at the well site until the purchaser retrieves it by tank truck 
direct purchases of our crude oil are made statewide at our well sites by barrett oil purchasing company 
our natural gas has multiple markets throughout the eastern united states through gas transmission lines 
access to these markets is presently provided by three companies in northeastern tennessee  cumberland valley resources  nami resources company  and tengasco 
local markets in tennessee are served by citizens gas utility district and the powell clinch utility district 
natural gas is delivered to the purchaser via gathering lines into the main gas transmission line 
surplus gas is placed in storage facilities or transported to east tennessee natural gas which serves tennessee and virginia 
in fiscal  and  sales to barrett oil purchasing and sunoco  collectively  represented approximately   and  respectively  of our total tennessee revenues 
drilling statistics historically  our drilling activities have generally concentrated on the recompletion of wells in the cook inlet region and the exploitation and extension of existing producing fields in the appalachian region 
in fiscal  we transitioned our efforts to the construction of a custom rig for the osprey platform  rig  with the anticipation that it will restore all previously producing wells on the platform 
we also made significant improvements and modifications to one of our rigs  rig  to enable onshore drilling in winter conditions while complying with alaska regulations 
upon certification from the aogcc in march  we mobilized rig to the kustatan gas field to workover the kf well  a previously producing gas well  and to the otter prospect in april to begin drilling the otter well 
in addition to rig construction and modification activities  we successfully brought on line two previously producing wells on the osprey platform  ru and ru after a short period of production  ru ceased production as a result of an esp failure 
our objective for the coming year is to utilize rig on the osprey platform to repair all non producing wells and 
table of contents restore production to anticipated capacity 
we incurred dry hole costs on one well in alaska and two wells in tennessee 
in alaska  we explored two new zones in our kf that were unproductive 
the cost of exploring the two new zones was expensed in in tennessee  we drilled two new development wells that were unproductive 
the development cost of these wells was capitalized in the following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years drilling activities gross net gross net gross net development producing cook inlet appalachian region total producing non producing cook inlet appalachian region total non producing injection cook inlet appalachian region total injection dry cook inlet appalachian region total dry total development exploratory productive cook inlet appalachian region total productive dry cook inlet appalachian region total dry pending determination total exploratory total drilling activity

gross and net undeveloped and developed acreage our staff of professional geologists utilize results from logs  seismic data and other tools to evaluate existing wells and to predict the location of economically attractive new natural gas and oil reserves 
to further this process  we have collected and continue to collect logs  core data  production information and other raw data available from state and private agencies and other companies and individuals actively drilling in the regions being evaluated 
from this information  the geologists develop models of the subsurface structures and formations that are used to predict areas for prospective economic development 
on the basis of these models  we obtain available natural gas and oil leaseholds  farm outs and other development rights in these prospective areas 
in most cases  to secure a lease  we pay a lease bonus and an annual rental payment  converting to a royalty upon initial production 
in addition  overriding royalty payments may be granted to third parties in conjunction with the acquisition of drilling rights initially leased by others 
we believe that we hold good and defensible title to our developed properties  in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry 
as is customary in the industry  a preliminary title examination is conducted at the time the undeveloped properties are acquired 
prior to the commencement of drilling operations  a title examination is conducted and remedial work is performed with respect to discovered defects which we deem to be significant 
title examinations have been performed with respect to substantially all of our producing properties 
certain of the properties we own are subject to royalty  overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary to the industry 
the properties may also be subject to additional burdens  liens or encumbrances customary to the industry  including items such as operating agreements  current taxes  development obligations under natural gas and oil leases  farm out agreements and other restrictions 
we do not believe that any of these burdens will materially interfere with the use of the properties

we provide information on two types of proved reserves developed and undeveloped 
proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods and proved undeveloped reserves are reasonably certain reserves in drilling units immediately adjacent to the drilling unit containing a producing well as well as areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a producing well 
unproved reserves are based on geological and or engineering data similar to that used in estimates of proved reserves  but technical  contractual  or regulatory uncertainties preclude such reserves being classified as proved 
they are sub 
table of contents classified as probable and possible 
probable reserves are attributed to known accumulations and usually claim a confidence level of recovery 
possible reserves are attributed to known accumulations that have a less likely chance of being recovered than probable reserves 
this term is often used for reserves which are claimed to have at least a certainty of being produced 
reasons for classifying reserves as possible include varying interpretations of geology  reserves not producible at commercial rates  uncertainty due to reserve infill see page from adjacent areas and projected reserves based on future recovery methods 
the following table shows proved oil and gas reserves as of april   based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in fiscal  held flat for the life of the production  except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms 
this table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a energy equivalent ratio

in fiscal  we did not develop any puds 
we anticipate developing three of our offshore puds in alaska s redoubt unit during fiscal  including redoubt a  a and a 
additionally  we expect to develop the redoubt pud in fiscal depending on the availability of an onshore drilling rig  we also plan on developing two puds in alaska s west macarthur river field in fiscal including wmru and preparation of oil and gas reserve information our reserve estimates for oil and natural gas at april  for our cook inlet and appalachian region assets were prepared by ralph e 
davis associates  inc  an independent engineering firm 
our reserve reports  which are filed as exhibits to this annual report  were prepared using engineering and geological methods widely accepted in the industry 
all reserve definitions comply with the applicable definitions of the rules of the sec 
the accuracy of the reserve estimates is dependent upon the quality of available data and upon independent geological and engineering interpretation of that data 
for the proved developed producing reserves  the estimates were made when considered to be definitive  using performance methods that utilize extrapolations of various historical data including  but not limited to  oil  gas and water production and pressure history 
for the other proved producing  proved behind pipe reserves  proved undeveloped reserves  and probable and possible reserves estimates were made using volumetric methods 
our reserve estimate for oil and natural gas at april  and for our cook inlet assets was prepared by ralph e 
davis associates  inc our reserve estimates for oil and gas at april  and for our appalachian region assets were prepared by lee keeling and associates  inc  an independent engineering firms 
internal controls over reserves estimate our policies regarding internal controls over reserve estimates require reserves to be in compliance with the sec definitions and guidance and for reserves to be prepared by an independent engineering firm 
our acting chief financial officer and the chief executive officer of cie are primarily responsible for the engagement and oversight of our independent engineering firms 
we provide the engineering firms with estimate preparation material such as property interests  production  current operation costs  current production prices and other information 
this information is reviewed by the chief executive 
table of contents officer of cie and our acting chief financial officer prior to submission to our third party engineering firm 
a letter which identifies the professional qualifications of each of the independent engineering firms who prepared the reserve reports are included in those reserve reports which are filed as exhibits to this annual report 
there was no conversion of unproved reserves to proved reserves during the fiscal year ended april  other ancillary services we also generate ancillary revenue from drilling activities 
while the equipment and personnel on hand are for the benefit of drilling on our own properties  from time to time we optimize unused capacity to perform drilling and related services on behalf of third parties 
in fiscal and  and  respectively  of our other revenue related to a plugging project for the us department of interior 
drilling wells for atlas energy resources  llc accounted for approximately of our other revenue for fiscal competitive conditions our oil and gas exploration activities in alaska and tennessee are undertaken in a highly competitive and speculative business environment 
in seeking any other suitable oil and gas properties for acquisition  we compete with a number of other companies doing business in alaska  tennessee and elsewhere  including large oil and gas companies and other independent operators  many with greater financial resources than we have 
at the local level  as we seek to expand our lease holdings  we compete with several companies who are also seeking to acquire leases in the areas of the acreage which we have under lease 
in alaska  we have nine significant competitors consisting of apache corporation  aurora gas  buccaneer alaska  hilcorp  conocophillips  furie  xto  linc energy  and marathon 
however  we believe we have a competitive edge because we already have existing oil and gas production  facilities  infrastructure  and pipelines that connect us to the oil and gas markets as well as some of the lowest operating cost in the area 
we believe that our existing alaska oil and gas reserves and current leases with large acreage positions enhance our competitive position within the area and will enable us to compete effectively for additional lease acreage with our competitors 
in the appalachian region  we have six significant competitors consisting of atlas energy resources  llc  consol energy  inc  can argo energy corporation  champ oil  and tengasco  inc these companies are in competition with us for oil and gas leases in known producing areas in which we currently operate  as well as other potential areas of interest 
we believe we can effectively compete for leases  however  as in the appalachian region we have name recognition of over years  we are the largest operator of oil and gas wells in tennessee and we have a staff of experienced  proven petroleum geologists and engineers that allows us to exploit the potential the appalachian region provides 
government regulation while the prices of oil and natural gas are set by the market  other aspects of our business and the industry in general are heavily regulated 
the availability of a ready market for oil production and natural gas depends on several factors beyond our control 
these factors include regulation of production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control  the amount of oil and natural gas available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to protect consumers from unfair treatment and oppressive control  to reduce the risk to the public and workers from the drilling  completion  production and transportation of oil and natural gas  to prevent waste of oil and natural gas  to protect rights among owners in a common reservoir and to control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies 
our exploration and production business is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations on the taxation of natural gas and oil  the development  production and marketing of natural gas and oil and environmental and safety matters 
many laws and regulations require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells  rates of production  water discharge  prevention of waste and other matters 
prior to commencing drilling activities for a well  we must procure permits and or approvals for the various stages of the drilling process from the applicable state and local agencies in the state in which the area to be drilled is located 
the permits and approvals include those for the drilling of wells 
additionally  other regulated matters include the following bond requirements in order to drill or operate wells  the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of well properties  the plugging and abandoning of wells  and the disposal of fluids 

table of contents the regulatory commission of alaska regulates the intrastate pipeline tariffs and encompasses all pipelines cie ships through including the cipl  ciggs  and beluga lines 
the regulatory commission of alaska must also review and approve most major long term gas sales contracts to public utilities  and through this mechanism plays the dominant role in determining gas pricing  since alaska has no spot market for gas 
southcentral alaska gas is typically sold under long or short term contracts as opposed to a spot market 
for the purposes of reasonably valuing gas reserves  therefore  future gas production is assumed to be sold at contract terms comparable to similarly situated producers 
cie has posted million in alaska and federal bonds 
the alaska dnr requires million in bonding to operate oil and gas leases on state lands  and the alaska oil and gas conservation commission aogcc requires a million bond to drill wells in the state 
these bonds are fully funded and are held by the first national bank of alaska in certificates of deposit for benefit of the various beneficiaries 
cie has a total of million in designated accounts to satisfy future abandonment obligations 
a million letter of credit is established for two class non hazardous injection wells for benefit of the united states environmental protection agency epa 
this letter of credit is backed by an account which must maintain a minimum value of million 
under the terms of the bankruptcy sale of the pacific energy assets  cie was obligated to establish accounts to cover abandonment obligations to cook inlet region  inc ciri  salamatof native association salamatof  and the state of alaska  million was required to cover future abandonment expenses related to the three west foreland gas wells for benefit of ciri  all of which has been funded 
an additional million is for future abandonment expenses associated with surface facilities and pipelines for benefit of ciri and salamatof  none of which has yet been funded 
in march  cie entered into a performance bond agreement that set the bond for the osprey platform at an inflation adjusted million 
the agreement sets a payment schedule totaling million in annual payments between july and july an existing interest bearing account containing approximately million as of april  is to be credited against the inflation adjusted million liability 
annual payments will be made after as necessary to the degree that inflation has caused the liability to increase over the amount contained in the funded accounts 
under the oil pollution act of  cie is required to fund a citizens advisory group  the cook inlet regional citizen s advisory council  under which its commitment is approximately  per year 
tennessee law requires that we obtain state permits for the drilling of oil and gas wells and to post a bond with the tennessee gas and oil board to ensure that each well is reclaimed and properly plugged when it is abandoned 
the reclamation bonds cost  per well 
the cost for the plugging bonds range from  to  per well depending on depth or million for ten wells 
currently  we have several old  blanket plugging bonds 
for most of the reclamation bonds  we have deposited a  certificate of deposit with the tennessee gas and oil board 
sales of natural gas in tennessee are affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation 
beginning in  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  which sets the rates and charges for transportation and sale of natural gas  adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas 
the stated purpose of ferc s changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry 
in  ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas by pipeline 
every five years  ferc will examine the relationship between the change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced by the industry 
we are not able to predict with certainty what effect  if any  these regulations will have on us 
the state and regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry generally increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability 
while we believe we are presently in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations  continued compliance or failure to comply and future legislation may have an adverse impact on our present and contemplated business operations 
because such federal and state regulation are amended or reinterpreted frequently  we are unable to predict with certainty the future cost or impact of complying with these laws 
we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment  such as the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended cercla  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the clean air act and the federal water pollution control act of the clean water act  which affect our operations and costs 
in particular  our exploration  development and production operations  our activities in connection with storage and transportation of oil and other hydrocarbons and our use of facilities for treating  processing or otherwise handling hydrocarbons and related wastes may be subject to regulation under these and similar state legislation 
these laws and regulations restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  
table of contents limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
cercla  also known as superfund  imposes liability for response costs and damages to natural resources  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act  on some classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of a disposal site and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
in the course of our ordinary operations  we may generate waste that may fall within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
we may be jointly and severally liable under cercla or comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these wastes have been disposed 
we currently lease properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas 
although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released on  under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on  under or from other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose actions with respect to the treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control 
these properties and wastes disposed on these properties may be subject to cercla and analogous state laws 
under these laws  we could be required to do the following remove or remediate previously disposed wastes  including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators  clean up contaminated property  including contaminated groundwater  or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination  and or clean up contaminated property  including contaminated groundwater  or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination 
at this time  we do not believe that we are associated with any superfund site and we have not been notified of any claim  liability or damages under cercla 
the rcra is the principal federal statute governing the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous wastes 
rcra imposes stringent operating requirements and liability for failure to meet such requirements on a person who is either a generator or transporter of hazardous waste or an owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment  storage or disposal facility 
at present  rcra includes a statutory exemption that allows most oil and natural gas exploration and production waste to be classified as nonhazardous waste 
a similar exemption is contained in many of the state counterparts to rcra 
as a result  we are not required to comply with a substantial portion of rcra s requirements because our operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes 
at various times in the past  proposals have been made to amend rcra to rescind the exemption that excludes oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes from regulation as hazardous waste 
repeal or modification of the exemption by administrative  legislative or judicial process  or modification of similar exemptions in applicable state statutes  would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and would cause us to incur increased operating expenses 
the clean water act imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of produced waters and other wastes into navigable waters 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands 
the clean water act requires us to construct a fresh water containment barrier between the surface of each drilling site and the underlying water table 
this involves the insertion of a seven inch diameter steel casing into each well  with cement on the outside of the casing 
the cost of compliance with this environmental regulation is approximately  per well 
certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system program prohibit the discharge of produced waters and sand  drilling fluids  drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into certain coastal and offshore waters 
further  the epa has adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges 
costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans 
the clean water act and comparable state statutes provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges for oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release 
we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the requirements of the clean water act and state statutes 
table of contents enacted to control water pollution 
our operations are also subject to laws and regulations requiring removal and cleanup of environmental damages under certain circumstances 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent in recent years  and may in certain circumstances impose strict liability  rendering a corporation liable for environmental damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such corporation 
such laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others  or for acts which may have been in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  our existing and proposed operations could result in liability for fires  blowouts  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials into surface and subsurface aquifers and other environmental damage  any one of which could result in personal injury  loss of life  property damage or destruction or suspension of operations 
we have an emergency action and environmental response policy program in place 
this program details the appropriate response to any emergency that management believes to be possible in our area of operations 
we believe we are presently in compliance with all applicable federal and state environmental laws  rules and regulations  however  continued compliance or failure to comply and future legislation may have an adverse impact on our present and contemplated business operations 
employees on april   we had employees 
offices our principal executive offices are located at cogdill road  suite  knoxville  tn 
at april   we maintained regional exploration and or production offices in huntsville and sunbright  tennessee and anchorage  alaska 
we lease all of our primary administrative offices in knoxville  tennessee and anchorage  alaska 
the current lease on our principal executive office runs through for more information regarding our obligations under office leases  please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption contractual obligations set forth in part ii  item of this form k 
our history we were formed in delaware in november in january  we acquired miller petroleum  inc  a privately held company controlled by mr 
deloy miller  our chairman  in a reverse merger in which miller petroleum  inc was the accounting survivor 
in conjunction with this transaction  we changed our name to miller petroleum  inc and re domesticated to the state of tennessee 
from to  we focused our operations on our existing acreage in the state of tennessee 
during this time  we participated in a joint venture with wind city oil gas  llc wind city  which resulted in the drilling of ten successful natural gas wells on our koppers  lindsay  and harriman acreage 
however  a dispute arose between wind city and us as to the winding up of the joint venture  and it was ultimately resolved after we were able to sell some of the acreage to atlas energy resources  llc atlas  in the atlas transaction was subject to unwinding pursuant to a pending litigation between our company and cnx gas company  llc as disclosed in item legal proceedings 
in august  we hired scott m 
boruff as our chief executive officer  and began to look for opportunities to expand our acreage and operations by acquiring other businesses and forming strategic partnerships with other exploration and production companies 
during mr 
boruff s tenure as ceo  we have acquired the assets of one company  and acquired sole ownership of three companies 
the first acquisition under mr 
boruff s leadership was the kto transaction in which we acquired certain oil and gas properties in exchange for  shares of our common stock valued at million 
shortly thereafter  we acquired etc  in exchange for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock valued at million 
in march  we formed miller energy gp and in april we formed miller energy income a  lp mei 
mei was organized to provide the capital required to invest in various types of oil and gas ventures including the acquisition of oil and gas leases  royalty interests  overriding royalty interests  working interests  mineral interests  real estate  producing and non producing wells  reserves  oil and gas related equipment including transportation lines and potential investments in entities that invest in such assets except for other investment partnerships sponsored by affiliates of mei 
through a subsidiary we own of mei  however due to the shared management of our company and mei  we consolidate this entity 

table of contents the third acquisition significantly expanded our operations  assets  and reserves  and took us into a new geographic area 
on december   we acquired of the membership interests in cie in exchange for four year stock warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share and million in cash to satisfy certain expenses as well as reimbursement for reasonable out of pocket expenses 
following the transaction  mr 
hall was appointed as a member of our board of directors and as chief executive officer of cie 
immediately prior to our acquisition of cie  cie acquired  through a delaware chapter bankruptcy proceeding  the former alaskan operations of pacific energy 
the purchased operations included the west mcarthur river oil field  the west foreland natural gas field  the redoubt field and related osprey offshore platform and kustatan production facility 
all of these assets are located along the west side of the cook inlet 
we also acquired  acres of oil and gas leases  including  acres under the susitna basin exploration license as well as completed d seismic geology and other production facilities 
at closing we paid pacific energy million and provided million for bonds  contract cure payments and other federal and state of alaska requirements to operate the facilities 
on june   we acquired a minority interest in each of two limited liability companies  pellissippi pointe  llc and pellissippi pointe ii  llc for total cash consideration of million 
we have also agreed to indemnify the sellers of the membership interests with respect to their guaranties of the construction loans held by the pellissippi pointe entities  but have not become direct guarantors of the loans ourselves 
as of april   the gross outstanding amount under the loans is million 
the pellissippi pointe entities own two office buildings in west knoxville  tennessee 
in november   we moved our corporate headquarters into one of these buildings  located at cogdill road  knoxville  tn 
we executed a five year lease for the space  and with the addition of us  the building is fully occupied by tenants 
in april we changed our name to miller energy resources  inc additional information regarding the acquisitions of the kto assets  etc  and cie can be found in note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part vi  item  of this form k 

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in the form k  you should carefully consider the following material risk factors associated with our business and the oil and gas industry in which we operate 
if any of the events described below occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected 
there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known  or may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future 
an investment in miller is subject to risks inherent in our business 
the trading price of our common shares will be affected by the performance of our business relative to  among other things  competition  market conditions and general economic and industry conditions 
the value of an investment in miller may decrease  resulting in a loss 
risks related to our business we have a history of operating losses  we incurred a net loss in both fiscal and fiscal and our net income in fiscal was the result of one time acquisition gains 
our revenues are not currently sufficient to fund our operating expenses and there are no assurances we will develop profitable operations 
we reported an operating loss of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in our net loss of approximately million in is primarily attributable to the operating loss  plus million in other expense  partially offset by an approximate million benefit from income taxes 
our net loss of approximately million in is primarily attributable to the operating loss  partially offset by an approximate million in other income and a million benefit from income taxes 
our net income of approximately million in fiscal is attributable to million in gains on the acquisition of the alaska and tennessee businesses 
as a result of the continued expansion of our business during fiscal  our operating expenses presently exceed our revenues 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we fully develop our operations following the acquisition of the alaskan assets 
although we expect an increase in our revenues to come from these development activities  we will continue depleting our cash resources to fund operating expenses until such time as we are able to significantly increase our revenues 
we may have to reduce our expansion efforts if we have not seen an increase in revenues in the next few months 
while we believe that our revenue will increase and exceed our operating expenses  there are no assurances that we will develop profitable operations 
we will be subject to new debt costs under the terms of our credit facility with apollo investment corporation 
monies borrowed are subject to an interest rate of per annum 
as described later in this report  in june we entered into a loan agreement with apollo investment corporation  under which a credit facility of up to million the apollo credit facility was made available to us 
at closing  we drew million under the apollo credit facility 
that amount and any other monies borrowed by us will bear interest at mezzanine rates and will be subject to a make whole premium and prepayment penalties if any prepayments are made prior to june  these debt costs may be substantial  and will adversely impact our results until such time as the facility has been repaid 
we are also subject to restrictions on our ability to pay for general and administrative expenses 
this could mean that we would need to make reductions in general and administrative expenses in future periods  which could impact our ability to operate our business and achieve our aggressive plan for development 
the apollo credit facility further establishes priorities among the projects we may choose to fund using either loan proceeds or our ordinary collections 
this may constrain management s ability to pursue projects in their optimal order  or require us to obtain consents from our lenders in order to deviate from the established list of priorities 
restrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations  fund our capital needs  respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests 
the apollo credit facility contains a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to dispose of assets  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred stock  pay dividends on our capital stock  create liens on our assets  enter into sale or leaseback transactions  enter into specified investments or acquisitions  repurchase  redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt  
table of contents merge or consolidate  or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries  engage in specified transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates  or pursue other corporate activities 
we may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under the apollo credit facility 
also  the apollo credit facility will require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition and oil and gas production level tests 
our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition and production level tests may be affected by events beyond our control and  as a result  we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition and production level tests 
these financial ratio restrictions and financial condition and production level tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices  a prolonged period of oil and natural gas prices as lower levels  or any event with limits our ability to meet oil and gas production requirements specified in the apollo credit facility could eventually result in our failing to meet one or more of the financial and production level covenants required by the apollo credit facility  which could require us to raise additional capital at an inopportune time or on terms not favorable to us 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition or production level tests could result in a default under the apollo credit facility 
a default under that facility  if not cured or waived  could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding under our credit agreement 
the accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable 
if that should occur  we may be unable to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if new financing were then available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
our business and stock price could be adversely affected if we are not successful in enhancing our management  systems  accounting  controls and reporting performance 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulties in implementing the management  operations and accounting systems  controls and procedures necessary to support our growth and expanded operations  as well as difficulties in complying with the accounting and reporting requirements related to our growth  acquisitions and status as an accelerated filer 
with respect to enhancing our management and operations team  we may experience difficulties in finding and retaining additional qualified personnel  and if such personnel are not available locally  we may incur higher recruiting  relocation  and compensation expense 
in an effort to meet the demands of our planned activities in fiscal and thereafter  we may be required to supplement our staff with contract and consultant personnel until we are able to hire new employees 
we further may not be successful in our efforts to enhance our systems  accounting  controls and reporting performance 
all of this may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and growth plans  on our regulatory and listing status  and on our stock price 
the staff of the sec has determined that certain of our forms k related to acquisitions we made in fiscal year are materially deficient which will adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital 
in connection with a review of our annual report on form k for the year ended april   the staff of the sec has concluded that we omitted required audited financial statements of three acquired businesses  including etc  kto and cie  from our forms k reporting these acquisitions 
until such time as we file audited financial statements  the staff has advised us it considers those forms k to be materially deficient and that it will not waive these financial statement requirements 
as a result  we are unable to utilize a short form registration statement on sec form s in addition  until such time as the audited financial statements of the acquired businesses are filed  the staff of the sec has advised us it will not declare effective any registration statements or post effective registration statements 
it is currently expected that we will not be able to rectify the deficient filings until the filing of this fiscal annual report on form k  at which time we will ask the staff of the sec to waive the financial statement requirements of form k for these acquisitions 
there are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to obtain a waiver 
we are party to several lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages against us 
an adverse decision in any of these lawsuits could result in our being forced to pay the prevailing plaintiff substantial amounts of money that would adversely impact our ability to continue with our development plans and or operate our business 
as described later in this annual report on form k  we are subject to lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages against us 
while we believe these suits to be of an essentially frivolous nature  litigation is inherently unpredictable  and any damages that could ultimately be paid by us in relation to any of these lawsuits are subject to significant uncertainty 
the timing and progression of each case is also unpredictable  it may take years for the case to make its way to trial and through various appeals 
the total amounts that will ultimately be paid by us in relation to all obligations relating to these lawsuits are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to us will be dependent on many factors  including the time spent litigating each case and the attorneys fees incurred by us in defending the cases 
our financial 
table of contents statements contained herein do not contain any reserves for any potential damages associated with this pending litigation 
if we should not be successful in our defense of this pending litigation  our results of operations in future periods could be materially adversely impacted 
cie s operations are subject to oversight by the alaska dnr 
cie s oil and gas leases could be terminated if it fails to uphold the terms of the assignment oversight agreement 
if the leases were terminated  we would be unable to continue our operations as they are presently conducted 
the assignment oversight agreement  along with the performance bond agreement for the redoubt unit and redoubt shoal field  also impose significant bonding requirements on us  which could adversely impact our ability to increase our revenues in future periods 
as a condition of the assignment of certain leases  cie entered into the assignment oversight agreement with the alaska dnr effective november  the terms of the agreement require cie to meet certain funding thresholds and report to the alaska dnr regularly  until the alaska dnr determines that cie has completed its development and operation obligations under the leases 
should cie fail to submit the information required under the agreement  or spend funds for items or activities that do not support core oil and gas activity as set out in the plan of operations or plan of development for the leases  the alaska dnr could choose to terminate the leases 
additionally  on march   cie entered into a performance bond agreement with the dnr concerning certain bonding requirements initially established by the assignment oversight agreement 
the performance bond  which is set at million  is intended to ensure that cie has sufficient funds to meet its dismantlement  removal and restoration obligations pertaining to the redoubt unit and redoubt shoal field 
the agreement includes a funding schedule  which requires payments annually on july  beginning in  of amounts ranging from million to million per year  and totaling million  as approximately million was funded by the previous owner 
if cie is more than days late with a payment to the state trust account or more than days late providing proof of a payment into a private account  the state will assess a late payment fee of  our obligation to fund the bond beginning in july will adversely impact our cash resources available to devote to the expansion of our operations 
if we must pay one or more late payment fees  it will further reduce the cash resources we have available to devote to the expansion of our operations and could adversely impact our ability to increase our revenues in future periods 
we may be subject to regulatory actions surrounding the filing of the form k on july   the audit committee of our board of directors determined that our consolidated balance sheet at april   and our consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended collectively  the financial statements  as well as the report of kpmg llp dated july  on such statements  all as included in our form k  should not be relied upon 
the form k was filed with the sec on july  prior to kpmg llp completing its audit of the consolidated financial statements and issuing their independent accountants report thereon  or issuing its consent to the use of their report 
we have received a request from the sec for a more detailed explanation regarding the specific circumstances that lead to the filing of the form k that included the audit report and consent from kpmg llp prior to the completion of their audit 
in september  we provided the requested explanation to the sec and are fully cooperating with the staff 
we have not received and cannot predict the nature of any regulatory responses or actions that may be required of us surrounding the filing of the form k 
such responses could divert management s time and attention from the operation of our business and could result in increased legal fees and fines 
we will be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions  and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult 
our business plan contemplates significant acquisitions of reserves  properties  prospects  and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy  which may include the acquisition of asset packages of producing properties or existing companies or businesses operating in our industry 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors  including recoverable reserves  future oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials  development and operating costs  and potential environmental and other liabilities 
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain 
in connection with these assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices 
our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves 
inspection s may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems 
we are not entitled to 
table of contents contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquired properties on an as is basis 
significant acquisitions of existing companies or businesses and other strategic transactions may involve additional risks  including diversion of our management s attention to evaluating  negotiating  and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions  the challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations  information management  and other technology systems  and business cultures with our own while carrying on our ongoing business  difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations  and the challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our business 
members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process  which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business 
if our senior management is not able to manage the integration process effectively  or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on the acreage 
a sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped 
unless production is established on these leases during their terms  the leases will expire 
if our leases expire  we will lose our right to develop the related properties 
our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors  including drilling results  oil and natural gas prices  the availability and cost of capital  drilling  and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints  and regulatory approvals 
our susitna basin exploration licenses require us to fulfill certain work commitments and convert acreage to leases in order to retain the acreage after the term of the license 
over  acres of our total acreage consists of the three susitna basin exploration licenses in cook inlet  alaska 
these three licenses require us to spend million in work commitments before we may convert the licenses into leases 
we may not be able to complete our work commitments in a timely manner  or if we do complete them  we may not identify any acreage that we would convert to leases 
this could result in a substantial decrease in our total acreage in the cook inlet basin 
approximately of our total estimated proved reserves at april  were proved undeveloped reserves 
in addition  there are no assurances that probable and possible reserves will be converted to proved reserves 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data included in the reserve engineer reports assumes that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves 
although cost and reserve estimates attributable to our natural gas and crude oil reserves have been prepared in accordance with industry standards  we cannot be sure that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated 
we also have a significant amount of unproved reserves at april  there is significant uncertainty attached to unproved reserve estimates  which include probable and possible reserves 
proved reserves are more likely to be produced than probable reserves and probable reserves are more likely to be produced than possible reserves 
there are no assurances that we can develop probable or possible reserves into proved reserves  or that if developed  probable reserves will become producing reserves to the level of the estimates 
our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefitting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks 
to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines  we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk 
in addition  our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production falls short of the hedged volumes  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements  or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices 

table of contents our business depends on oil and natural gas transportation facilities  most of which are owned by others 
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in large part on the availability  proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties 
the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans for properties 
the lack of availability of these facilities for an extended period of time could negatively affect our revenues 
federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand  pipeline pressures  damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce  gather and transport oil and natural gas 
the majority of our oil production is dedicated to one customer and as a result  our credit exposure to this customer is significant 
we have entered into an oil marketing agreement with tesoro refining and marketing company under which tesoro purchases all of our net oil production in alaska 
we generally do not require letters of credit or collateral to support these trade receivables 
accordingly  a material adverse change in their financial condition could adversely impact our ability to collect the applicable receivables  and thereby affect our financial condition 
future economic conditions in the us and key international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results 
the us and other world economies are slowly recovering from a global financial crisis and recession that began in growth has resumed but is modest and at an unsteady rate 
there are likely to be significant long term effects resulting from the recession and credit market crisis  including a future global economic growth rate that is slower than in the years leading up to the crisis  and more volatility may occur before a sustainable  yet lower  growth rate is achieved 
global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources  including fossil fuels 
a lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices  which would reduce our cash flows from operation and our profitability 
the majority of our reserves and assets  including our cook inlet basin leases and our osprey platform  are located in a region of active volcanoes and we could be subject to the adverse impacts of natural disasters or other regional events 
the cook inlet region contains active volcanoes  including augustine volcano  mount spurr and mount redoubt  and volcanic eruptions in this region have been associated with earthquakes and tsunamis and debris avalanches have also resulted in tsunamis 
in the cook inlet pipeline co 
suspended operations on several occasions as a result of the spring major eruption of mount redoubt which also resulted in a shutdown of the drift river oil terminal 
our operations in this area are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with operations in a geographical region which is subject to natural disasters and we are susceptible to the risk of damage to our operations and assets located in the cook inlet basin 
while our facilities are engineered to withstand seismic activity  and the current tight line configuration should allow us to continue shipments through an active volcanic period without much interruption  we do not maintain business interruption insurance which could adversely impact our results of operations as the result of lost revenues in future periods 
the majority of our oil and gas reserves are located in the cook inlet basin 
any regional events  including price fluctuations  the natural disasters mentioned above  restrictive laws or regulations that increase costs  reduce availability of equipment or supplies  reduce demand or limit our production may impact our operations more than if our reserves were more geographically diversified 
risks related to the oil and natural gas industry estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will affect materially the quantities and present value of our reserves 
estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by independent petroleum engineers and geologists 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves  including factors beyond our control and that of our engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves  or of cash flows attributable to such reserves  is a function of the available data  assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices and expenditures for future development drilling and exploration activities  and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
additionally  reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions  based upon production history  development drilling and exploration activities and prices of oil and natural gas 
actual future production  revenue  taxes  development drilling expenditures  operating expenses  underlying information  quantities of 
table of contents recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information set forth herein 
we may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill 
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks  including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs 
the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive  and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells 
the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically 
the costs of drilling  completing  and operating wells are often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed  or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including  without limitation unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  fires  explosions  blowouts  and surface cratering  marine risks such as capsizing  collisions  or adverse weather conditions  and increase in the cost of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs and equipment 
future drilling activities may not be successful  and  if unsuccessful  this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
while all drilling  whether developmental or exploratory  involves these risks  exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
oil and gas prices fluctuate due to a number of uncontrollable factors  creating a component of uncertainty in our development plans and overall operations 
declines in prices adversely affect our financial results and rate of growth in proved reserves and production 
oil and gas markets are very volatile  and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influence our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
the prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in global supply and demand for oil and gas  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  the level of global oil and gas exploration and production activity  weather conditions  technological advances affecting energy consumption  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and tax policies  proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines and other transportation facilities 
additionally  a decline in future oil and natural gas prices and the related reduction in revenues could precipitate a breach in the interest coverage ratio covenant contained in our loan agreement with apollo 
discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 
the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted  while related per unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors 
therefore  unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones  secondary recovery reserves  or tertiary recovery reserves  or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced 
future oil and gas production is  therefore  highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis 
furthermore  if oil or gas prices increase  our cost for additional reserves could also increase 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this annual report is the current market value of our estimated natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves are based on prices and costs on the date of the estimate  held constant for the life of the properties 
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate 
actual future net cash flows will also be affected by increases or decreases in consumption by oil and gas purchasers and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both the production and the incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties affects the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily an appropriate discount factor for determining a market valuation 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the relevance of the discount factor 

table of contents our business involves many operating risks that may result in substantial losses for which insurance may be unavailable or inadequate 
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for oil and gas  such as fires  natural disasters  explosions  formations with abnormal pressures  casing collapses  uncontrollable flows of underground gas  blowouts  surface cratering  pipeline ruptures or cement failures  and environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks  oil spills and discharges of toxic gases 
any of these risks can cause substantial losses resulting from injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damages  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of our operations and repair and remediation costs 
in addition  our liability for environmental hazards may include conditions created by the previous owners of properties that we purchase or lease 
we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses 
we do not believe that insurance coverage for all environmental damages that could occur is available at a reasonable cost 
losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks  or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could harm our financial condition and results of operation 
our industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation that may limit our operations and negatively impact our production 
as a result of increased enforcement of existing regulations and potential new regulations following the gulf of mexico oil spill  the costs for complying with government regulation could increase 
extensive federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations in the united states affect all of our operations 
environmental laws to which we are subject in the us include  but are not limited to  the clean air act and comparable state laws that impose obligations related to air emissions  the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra  and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the handling  storage  treatment or disposal of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and comparable state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or at locations to which our hazardous substances have been transported for disposal  and the clean water act  and comparable state laws that regulate discharges of wastewater from our facilities to state and federal waters 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or newly adopted laws or regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements  and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements on such operations 
certain environmental laws  including cercla and analogous state laws  impose strict  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or hydrocarbons have been disposed or otherwise released 
moreover  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances  hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment 
environmental legislation may require that we do the following acquire permits before commencing drilling  restrict spills  releases or emissions of various substances produced in association with our operations  limit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas  take reclamation measures to prevent pollution from former operations  take remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as plugging abandoned wells and remedying contaminated soil and groundwater  and take remedial measures with respect to property designated as a contaminated site 
there is inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations due to our handling of natural gas and other petroleum products  air emissions and water discharges related to our operations  and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
the costs of any of these liabilities are presently unknown but could be significant 
we may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance 
in addition  we are unable to predict what impact the gulf oil spill will have on independent oil and gas companies such as our company 
for instance  companies such as ours currently pay an per barrel tax on all oil produced in the us which is contributed to the oil spill liability trust fund 
there are pending proposals to raise this tax to to per barrel 
it is also probable that there will be increased enforcement of existing regulations and adoption of new regulations which will also increase our cost of doing business which would reduce our operating profits in future periods 
the effects of future environmental legislation on our business are unknown but could be substantial 
environmental legislation is evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement  larger fines and liability and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
changes in  or enforcement of  environmental laws may result in a curtailment of our production activities  or a material increase in the costs of production  development drilling or exploration  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 
in addition  many countries  as well as several states in the united states have agreed to regulate emissions of 
table of contents greenhouse gases 
methane  a primary component of natural gas  and carbon dioxide  a byproduct of burning natural gas  are greenhouse gases 
regulation of greenhouse gases could adversely impact some of our operations and demand for products in the future 
should we fail to comply with all applicable ferc administered statutes  rules  regulations and orders  we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines 
under the energy policy act of  the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  has authority to impose penalties for violations of the natural gas act  up to million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation 
ferc has recently proposed and adopted regulations that may subject our facilities to reporting and posting requirements 
additional rules and legislation pertaining to these and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time 
failure to comply with ferc regulations could subject us to civil penalties 
proposed federal  state  or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs 
several proposals are before the us congress that  if implemented  would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act 
several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting  transparency  and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether 
in addition  some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and or hydraulic fracturing  or are considering doing so 
we routinely use fracturing techniques in the us and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore 
it is typically done at substantial depths in very tight formations 
although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing  any new federal  state  or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the us the proposed us federal budget for fiscal year includes certain provisions that  if passed as originally submitted  will have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
on february   the office of management and budget released a summary of the proposed us federal budget for fiscal year the proposed budget repeals many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and imposes new taxes 
the provisions include elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred  repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies  and an increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers 
should some or all of these provisions become law  our taxes will increase  potentially significantly  which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows 
this could also cause us to reduce our drilling activities 
as none of these proposals have yet to be voted on or become law  we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business 
risks related to the ownership of our securities we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the future 
we intend to retain any future earning to fund our operations  therefore  we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
also  our credit agreement does not permit us to pay dividends on our common stock 
we are prohibited by tennessee law from paying dividends  if after the payment of the dividend we are unable to pay our debts as they come due in the ordinary course of business  or if our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed  if we were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend  to satisfy any preferential liquidation rights to those of our common stock 
certain of our outstanding warrants contain cashless exercise provisions which means we will not receive any cash proceeds upon their exercise 
at april  we have common stock warrants outstanding to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with an average exercise price of per share which are exercisable on a cashless basis 
this means that the holders  rather than paying the exercise price in cash  may surrender a number of warrants equal to the exercise price of the warrants being exercised 
it is possible that the warrant holders will utilize the cashless exercise feature which will deprive us of additional capital which might otherwise be obtained if the warrants did not contain a cashless feature 
a large portion of our outstanding common shares are restricted securities and we have outstanding options  warrants and purchase rights to purchase approximately of our currently outstanding common stock 
the exercise of these options  warrants and purchase rights would be dilutive to our current shareholders  and could adversely effect our stock price 

table of contents we may in the future issue our previously authorized and unissued securities  resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders 
we are currently authorized to issue  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock with such designations  preferences and rights as determined by our board of directors 
at july  we had  shares of common stock outstanding together with outstanding options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at exercise prices of between and per share 
of our outstanding shares of common stock at july   approximately  shares are restricted securities 
future sales of restricted common stock under rule or otherwise could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
in addition  in the event of the exercise of the warrants and options  the number of our outstanding common stock will increase by approximately  which will have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders 
the impacts of non cash gains and losses from derivative accounting in future periods could materially impact our financial results 
as of april   we have warrants with full ratchet or reset provisions  which means that the exercise or conversion price adjusts to pricing as described within the respective agreements 
these instruments require liability classification and mark to market accounting with changes in the estimated fair value recorded to our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  to manage variability in cash flows resulting from fluctuation in oil prices  we occasionally enter into commodity derivatives to hedge a portion of our crude oil production 
these instruments are marked to market on a periodic basis with changes in the estimated fair value recorded to our consolidated statement of operations 
as of april   we have a derivative liability of million 
we recognized a non cash loss on derivatives of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect to record either a gain or loss based upon the market price of oil and our common stock 
the amount of quarterly non cash gains or losses we will record in future periods is unknown at this time as the measurement is based upon the fair market value of oil and our common stock on the measurement date 
it is likely  however  that these non cash gains or losses will continue to have a material impact on our financial results in future periods 
substantial stock ownership by our affiliates may limit the ability of our non affiliate stockholders to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring shareholder approval 
as of april   management and members of the board of directors own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  they have significant influence in the election of our directors and  therefore  our policies and direction 
this concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are an independent exploration and production company that utilizes seismic data and other technologies for geophysical exploration and development of oil and gas wells in the appalachian region of east tennessee and in southcentral alaska 
occasionally  during times of excess capacity  we offer these services  on a contract basis  to third party customers primarily engaged in our core competency natural gas exploration and production 
executive overview strategy our mission is to grow a profitable exploration and production company for the long term benefit of our shareholders by focusing on the development of our reserves  continued expansion of our oil and natural gas properties and increase in our production and related cash flow 
we intend to accomplish these objectives through the execution of our core strategies  which include develop acquired acreage 
we will focus on organically growing production through drilling for our own benefit on existing leases and acreage in the exploration licenses with a view towards retaining the majority of working interest in the new wells 
this strategy will allow us to maintain operational control  which we believe will translate to long term benefits  increase production 
we plan on increasing oil and gas production through the maintenance  repair and optimization of wells located in the cook inlet basin and development of wells in the appalachian region of east tennessee 
our management team will employ the latest available technologies to restore as well as explore and develop our properties  expand our revenue stream 
we intend on fully exploiting our mid stream facilities  such as our injection wells and the kustatan production facility  our ability to engage in the commercial disposal of waste generated by oil and gas operations  and our capacity to process third party fluids and natural gas and to offer excess electrical power to net users in the cook inlet area  and pursue strategic acquisitions 
we have significantly increased our oil and gas properties through strategic low cost high value acquisitions 
under the same strategy  our management team will continually seek for opportunities that meet our criteria for risk  reward  rate of return  and growth potential 
we plan to leverage our management team s expertise to pursue value creating acquisitions when the opportunities arise  subject to the availability of sufficient capital 
our management team is focused on obtaining the financial flexibility required to successfully execute these core strategies 
during fiscal  through the use of funds provided under our credit facility  we completed the modification and improvements to rig and are on our way to completing the construction of rig these accomplishments  although marked with challenges  have bolstered our ability to carry out our onshore and offshore drilling plans 
our ability to deliver successful results and continue enhancing shareholder value have been strengthened as a result of these recent accomplishments 
however  our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and  therefore  our cash flow and income are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing current reserves and economically finding  developing and acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will focus on adding reserves through drilling and well recompletions  as well as the corresponding costs necessary to produce such reserves and will seek to grow our production and our asset base by pursuing both organic growth opportunities and acquisitions of producing oil and natural gas reserves that are suitable for us 
financial and operating results we continued to utilize funds under our prior credit facility along with other financing sources and operational cash flow to support our capital expenditures for fiscal for the month period ended april   we reported notable achievements in several key areas 
highlights for the year include we completed significant modifications and improvements to rig  allowing the rig to drill in winter conditions while complying with alaska regulations 
the aogcc inspected and issued final approvals to operate the rig in march the rig was mobilized to our kustatan gas field to workover the kf well and  at completion of the kf well  mobilized to the otter prospect to begin drilling otter we successfully mobilized all components of rig to the osprey platform 
in january the region 
table of contents experienced prolonged near record cold weather  which caused us to temporarily delay rig assembly efforts on the osprey platform due to concerns of safety 
the cold weather also led to significant generation of ice volume in the cook inlet and made shipping and the operation of work boats impossible 
as warmer temperatures moderated the region  we resumed work on the assembly of rig  which in its present state is substantially completed and expected to be fully operational in july on april   we issued a new class of series a cumulative preferred stock to accredited and institutional investors in a private offering exempt from registration under the securities act of  as amended 
we received gross proceeds of million 
these funds were used primarily to workover the kf well and drill the otter well 
on april   we were awarded susitna basin exploration license no 
 which consists of  acres 
it granted us an exclusive five year license to explore for oil and gas on the specified lands 
upon fulfillment of a million work commitment  we will gain the option to convert any part of the licensed area into oil and gas leases 
outlook as we head into  with the expected completion of rig  we believe our inventory of recompletion as well as exploration and development projects offers numerous growth opportunities 
our current capital budget is to million 
nearly all of our budget is expected to be spent on projects in alaska  with the remaining amount allocated to our appalachian region 
due to the uncertainty associated with changes in commodity prices  we closely monitor our cost levels and revise our capital budgets based on changes in forecasted cash flows 
this means our plan for capital expenditures may change as a result of anticipated changes in the market place 
further  our ability to fully utilize the budget will be dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  access to capital  rig being operational in a timely manner  weather and regulatory approval 
we expect to fund our capital budget with funds borrowed under the apollo credit facility  proceeds received from anticipated preferred stock offerings  cash flows from operations and proceeds from potential asset dispositions

loss on derivatives  net we experience earnings volatility as a result of not using hedge accounting to account for changes in commodity prices 
as the positions of future oil production are marked to market  both realized and unrealized gains or losses are included on our consolidated statements of operations 
we do not engage in speculative trading and utilize commodity derivatives only as a mechanism to lock in future prices for a portion of our expected crude oil production 
changes in commodity prices typically account for a significant portion of our net gain loss on derivative transactions

gain on acquisitions during  we recorded a gain of million related to restricted cash held by the state of alaska that was not previously accounted for as part of the alaska acquisition in this amount could not be verified until our entry into the performance bond agreement with the state of alaska on march  under the agreement  we are required to post a bond for an aggregate amount of million with million restricted cash held by the state to be applied to the total bond requirement 
we recorded this event as a gain on acquisition for our alaska subsidiary 
liquidity and capital resources our cash flows  both in the short term and long term  are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices 
significant deterioration in commodity prices negatively impacts revenues  earnings and cash flows  capital spending  and potentially our liquidity 
sales volumes and costs also impact cash flows  however  these historically have not been as volatile or as impactful as commodity prices in the short term 
our long term cash flows are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing current reserves and economically finding  developing and acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
cash investments are required continuously to fund exploration and development projects and acquisitions  which are necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves 
we may not be able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs  which could materially adversely affect our future liquidity

we may elect to utilize excess borrowing capacity  access to both debt and equity capital markets  or proceeds from the occasional sale of nonstrategic assets to supplement our liquidity and capital resource needs 
in fiscal  we experienced operating losses and had a working capital deficit as of april  we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we fully develop our assets in the cook inlet and appalachian regions 
although we expect an increase in our revenues to come from these development activities  we will continue depleting our cash resources to fund operating expenses until such time as we are able to significantly increase our revenues above costs 
we believe that the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to us  combined with internally generated cash flows and other potential sources of funds  will be adequate to fund our short term and long term operations  including our capital budget  repayment of debt maturities  and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies  however  we are restricted under our new apollo investment corporation credit facility to commit to certain financial requirements and provisions as described in note subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv  item of this form k

non gaap measures adjusted earnings adjusted ebitda is a significant performance metric used as a quantitative standard by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  research analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness  and our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our industry  without regard to financing or capital structure

table of contents for the year ended april  in thousands income loss before income taxes adjusted by interest expense  net depreciation  depletion and amortization accretion of asset retirement obligation exploration expense stock based compensation unrealized loss on derivatives adjusted ebitda critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements requires us to utilize estimates and make judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis  and the results of these evaluations form a basis for making decisions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  we believe that the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies 
estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions  operating conditions  and government regulations 
proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled  or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility 
undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years  unless specific circumstances justify a longer time 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
further  these reserves are the basis for our unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
reserves as of april    and  were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous months  held flat for the life of the production  except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements 
we elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing 
our unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures for fiscal years and have been revised to reflect revisions to the reserve classification of certain reserves related to our redoubt field 
asset retirement obligation we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety  and public relations considerations 
aro associated with retiring tangible long lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period 
table of contents in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable 
the liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset 
the aro liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation  and similar activities associated with our oil and gas properties 
we utilize current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value 
fair value of financial instruments we measure fair value of our financial and non financial assets and liabilities on a recurring basis 
accounting standards define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value and require certain disclosures about fair value measurements for assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis 
all of our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our financial statements 
fair value is the exit price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities  level quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are inactive  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly  or level prices or valuations that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
we consider an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis  and view an inactive market as one in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability  prices are not current  or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers 
where appropriate  we consider non performance risk in determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation the computation of stock based compensation requires the use of a valuation model 
asc  compensation stock compensation  requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding model assumptions such as stock price volatility  expected terms  and expected forfeiture rates  to value equity based compensation 
we use various pricing models to determine the fair value of our stock options and warrants 
changes in the underlying assumptions could result in a material change to the fair value of the stock based awards 
although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions  significant unanticipated changes in those estimates  interpretations and assumptions may result in recording expenses that could have a significant effect on results of operations in the future 
purchase price allocation accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company s assets and liabilities and tax related carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  we made various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties 
to estimate the fair values of these properties  we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above under estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows of this item estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  which amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 

table of contents the amended guidance clarifies many requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
additionally  the amendments clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
the guidance provided in asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this update is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 which becomes effective at the same time as asu  to defer the effective date of provisions of asu that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
we expect adoption of asu or asu will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which will enhance disclosures by requiring an entity to disclose information about netting arrangements  including rights of offset  to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
this pronouncement was issued to facilitate comparison between financial statements prepared on the basis of us gaap and ifrs 
this update is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after january  and is to be applied retroactively for all comparative periods presented 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we determined that all other issued  but not yet effective accounting pronouncements are inapplicable or insignificant to us and once adopted are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position 
supplemental quarterly financial information unaudited the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly results for the eight quarters ended april  the comparability of our results between quarters is impacted by the million gain we recorded in the third quarter ended january  in connection with the december acquisition of our alaska properties  quarterly increases in production that have resulted from bringing online alaskan wells acquired  and the million gain on acquisition recorded in the fourth quarter ended april  see note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv  item of this form k

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk 
the term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil  gas  and interest rates  or adverse governmental actions 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
the forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
commodity risk our revenues  earnings  cash flow  capital investments  and  ultimately  future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas  which have historically been very volatile due to unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction  weather  and political climate 
we periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil production through financial arrangements intended to support oil prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil price fluctuations 
in and  approximately to of our crude oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges 
realized gains or losses from the our price risk management activities are recognized in other income and expense when the associated production occurs 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
on april   we had open oil derivative hedges in a liability position with a fair value of million 
a increase in oil prices would increase the fair value by approximately million  while a decrease in prices would decrease the fair value by approximately million 
these fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at april  for notional volumes and terms associated with our derivative contracts  please see note derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv  item of this form k 
we conduct our risk management activities for commodities under the controls and governance of our risk management policy 
the audit committee of our board of directors approves and oversees these controls  which have been implemented by designated members of the management team 
the treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities 
controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on volume  segregation of duties  delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 
interest rate risk we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on of our debt 
at april   there were no float rate debt that would expose us to market fluctuations in interest rates
