item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report 
overview we are a maryland corporation primarily focused on investing in  financing and managing residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans 
we are externally managed and advised by invesco advisers  inc  our manager  which is an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of invesco ltd 
we elected to qualify to be taxed as a reit commencing with our taxable year ended december  accordingly  we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our shareholders as long as we maintain our qualification as a reit 
we operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exclusion from the definition of investment company under the investment company act of  as amended the act 
our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our shareholders  primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation 
to achieve this objective  we primarily invest in the following agency rmbs  which are residential mortgage backed securities  for which a us government agency such as the government national mortgage association ginnie mae or a federally chartered corporation such as the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac guarantees payments of principal and interest on the securities  non agency rmbs  which are rmbs that are not issued or guaranteed by a us government agency or a federally chartered corporation  cmbs  which are commercial mortgage backed securities  and residential and commercial mortgage loans 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we finance our investments in agency rmbs  non agency rmbs and cmbs through short term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements 
we have also financed our investments in certain non agency rmbs  cmbs and residential and commercial mortgage loans by contributing capital to the invesco imrf fund that received financing under the us government s pipp  established and managed by our manager or one of its affiliates  which  in turn  invests in our target assets 
public offerings during  the company completed three follow on common stock offerings and issued million shares of common stock with net proceeds of approximately billion 
in addition  the company issued million shares of common stock under the share repurchase feature of the company s dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan drspp with net proceeds of approximate million 
the investment of the proceeds from these offerings and the related increase in borrowings under our repurchase agreements increased our investment portfolio and was the primary driver for the changes in our results of operations 
factors impacting our operating results our operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of  and demand for  the target assets in which we invest 
our net interest income  which includes the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and prepayment speeds  as measured by the constant prepayment rate cpr on our target assets 
interest rates and prepayment speeds vary according to the type of investment  conditions in the financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
market conditions beginning in the summer of  significant adverse changes in financial market conditions resulted in a deleveraging of the entire global financial system 
as part of this process  residential and commercial mortgage markets in the united states experienced a variety of difficulties  including loan defaults  credit losses and reduced liquidity 
as a result  many lenders tightened their lending standards  reduced lending capacity  liquidated significant portfolios or exited the market altogether  and therefore  financing with attractive terms was generally unavailable 
in response to these unprecedented events  the us government has taken a number of actions to stabilize the financial markets and encourage lending 
significant measures include the enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of to  among other things  establish the troubled asset relief program tarp  the enactment of the housing and economic recovery act of hera  which established a new regulator for fannie mae and freddie mac and the establishment of the talf and the ppip 
some of these programs are beginning to expire and the impact of the wind down of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown 
increased volatility in the rmbs markets may have an adverse effect on the market value and performance of the rmbs in which we invest 
moreover  we rely on financing to acquire  on a leveraged basis  the target assets in which we invest 
if market conditions deteriorate further  our lenders may exit the repurchase market  further tighten lending standards  or increase the amount of equity capital required to obtain financing making it more difficult and costly for us to obtain financing 
the dodd frank act enacted on july   contains numerous provisions affecting the financial and mortgage industries  many of which may have an impact on our operating environment and the target assets in which we invest 
consequently  the dodd frank act may affect our cost of doing business  may limit our investment opportunities and may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas 
on september   the us federal reserve announced operation twist  which is a program by which it intends to purchase  by the end of june  billion of us treasury securities with remaining maturities between and years and sell an equal amount of us treasury securities with remaining maturities of years or less 
operation twist could result in a flattening in the yield curve and lower long term interest rates 
lower long term interest rates could result in increased prepayment rates and a narrowing of our net interest margin 
consequently  operation twist and any other future securities purchase programs and actions by the us federal reserve could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the federal housing finance agency fhfa and the department of the treasury introduced the home affordable refinance program harp in early harp provides borrowers  who may not otherwise qualify for refinancing because of declining home values or reduced access to mortgage insurance  the ability to refinance their mortgages into a lower interest rate and or more stable mortgage product 
on october   the fhfa announced a series of changes to the rules regarding the harp with intent of increasing the number of borrowers eligible to refinance their mortgage under this program 
the fhfa announced changes to the guidelines related to loan to value  appraisals  and certain fees  among other things  subject to a variety of qualifications and the extension of the end date for the harp until december  it does not change the time period which these loans were originated  maintaining the requirement that the loans must have been guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac on or before may  we do not expect the current harp or future modifications to have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods 
on january   the us federal reserve announced that it would keep the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent and that it currently anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late low levels of federal funds rates may reduce our borrowing costs 
however  there can be no assurance that federal funds rates will remain near percent  or that such low levels will reduce our cost of funds 
investment activities as of december   of our equity was invested in agency rmbs  in non agency rmbs  in cmbs  and in the invesco imrf fund 
we continually evaluate market opportunities of each of our asset classes and adjust equity allocations based on our risk and return targets 
we use leverage on our target assets to achieve our return objectives 
for our total investment portfolio  we focus on securities we believe provide attractive returns when levered approximately to times 
the leverage may periodically exceed the stated ranges as we adjust our borrowings to obtain the best available source and minimize total interest expense  while maintaining our overall portfolio leverage guidelines 
as of december   we had approximately billion billion in year fixed rate securities that offered higher coupons and call protection based on the collateral attributes 
we balanced this with approximately billion billion in year fixed rate  approximately billion million in hybrid adjustable rate mortgages arms and approximately million million in arms we believe to have similar durations based on prepayment speeds 
as of december   we had purchased approximately billion million non agency rmbs 
as of december   we owned approximately billion million in cmbs financed with million million in repurchase agreements 
in addition  as of december   we had purchased approximately million million in cmos

these agreements are secured by our agency rmbs  non agency rmbs and cmbs and bear interest at rates that have historically moved in close relationship to the london interbank offer rate libor 
as of december   we had entered into repurchase agreements totalling billion billion 
the increase in borrowings was the result of the additional assets added after our follow on common stock offerings and the change in our portfolio composition 
we also committed to invest up to million in the invesco imrf fund  which  in turn  invests in our target assets 
as of december   approximately million million of our commitment to the invesco imrf fund has been called 
the company records the liability for mortgage backed securities purchased for which settlement has not taken place as an investment related payable 
as of december  and  the company had investment related payables of million and million  respectively  of which no items were outstanding greater than thirty days 
the change in the balance was primarily due to a decrease in unsettled mortgage backed securities purchased at the end of compared to  as a result of a follow on common stock offering which closed on december  hedging instruments we generally hedge as much of our interest rate risk as we deem prudent in light of market conditions 
no assurance can be given that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
our investment policies do not contain specific requirements as to the percentages or amount of interest rate risk that we are required to hedge 
interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because  among other things available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction  and the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value 
downward adjustments or mark to market losses reduce our shareholders equity 
as of december   we have entered into interest rate swap agreements designed to mitigate the effects of increases in interest rates under a portion of our repurchase agreements 
these swap agreements provide for fixed interest rates indexed off of one month libor and effectively fix the floating interest rates on billion billion of borrowings under our repurchase agreements as of december  the increase in the notional amount of interest rate swaps was due to the increase in borrowings after our follow on common stock offerings 
at december   all of our interest rate swaps are effective and the average maturity is years compared to years at december  we continue to adjust our interest rate hedge positions according to our hedging strategy and changing market conditions 
book value per share our book value was and as of december  and  respectively  on a fully diluted basis  after giving effect to our units of limited partnership interest in our operating partnership  which may be converted to common shares at the sole election of the company 
the decline in our book value was primarily due to the change in valuation of our investment portfolio and our interest rate hedges that are recorded in other comprehensive income loss on our balance sheet 
the value of our assets and liabilities change daily based on market conditions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s for interest rate risk and its impact on fair value 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties 
our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments that could affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our consolidated financial statements were based were reasonable at the time made and based upon information available to us at that time 
we rely upon independent pricing of our assets at each quarter s end to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates of fair market value 
for a discussion of our critical accounting policies  see notes to consolidated financial statements in the financial statements accompanying this report 
expected impact of new authoritative guidance on future financial information in april  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update  reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreements asu 
asu simplifies the accounting for financial assets transferred under repurchase agreements and similar arrangements  by eliminating the transferor s ability criterion from the assessment of effective control over those assets 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of the amended guidance will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements now or in the future 
in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs asu 
asu amends topic and does not modify the requirements for when fair value measurements apply  rather  it clarifies the board s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements  and changes to a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
for public entities  this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  early application by public entities is not permitted 
we do not anticipate any material impact from this guidance now or in the future

index to financial statements in december  the fasb issued accounting standards updated  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
asu amends topic to require additional disclosure information about offsetting and related arrangements 
entities will be required to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
this scope would include derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements 
the objective of this disclosure is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of us gaap and those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods

net income summary for the year ended december   our net income attributable to common shareholders was million million  million  or  basic and diluted net income per average share available to common shareholders 
the increase to net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  versus is primarily attributable to the growth in our average investment portfolio resulting from our follow on common stock offerings during and our average mbs portfolio increased approximately billion during over during  we completed three follow on common stock offerings raising approximately billion in equity

interest income and average earning asset yield our primary source of income is interest earned on our investment portfolio 
during  we had average earning assets of approximately billion billion  million and earned interest income of million million  million 
the yield on our average investment portfolio was the change in our average assets and the portfolio yield for versus was primarily the result of the increase in our investment portfolio in connection with adding leverage and utilizing proceeds from our follow on common stock offerings during and a change in our portfolio composition as we have allocated a higher amount of equity to agency rmbs at lower yields and higher leverage 
the change in our average assets and the portfolio yield for versus was primarily the result of the increase in our average investment portfolio after our follow on common stock offerings during and a full year of income earned on our investment portfolio during the cpr of our portfolio impacts the amount of premium and discount on the purchase of securities that is recognized into income

if the same calculation were to be applied for the three months ended september   the non agency rmbs cpr would have been and the overall cpr would have been interest expense and the cost of funds our largest expense is the interest expense on borrowed funds 
for  we had average borrowed funds of approximately billion billion  million and total interest expense of million million  million 
the increase in average borrowed funds for versus was primarily the result of increasing our investment portfolio leverage in connection with our follow on common stock offerings 
the increase in interest expense for versus was primarily the result of a higher average borrowing balance outstanding and higher average cost of funds

since a substantial portion of our repurchase agreements are short term  changes in market rates are directly reflected in our interest expense 
interest expense includes borrowing costs under repurchase agreements as well as costs for our interest rate hedges 
net interest income our net interest income  which equals interest income less interest expense for the year ended december   totaled million million  million 
our net interest rate margin for the year ended december   which equals the yield on our average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period  was  
the increase in net interest income was primarily the result of increasing our investment portfolio with our follow on common stock offerings 
the decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to higher hedged cost of funds related to the increase in average borrowings and interest rate swaps 
in addition  since our initial public offering was completed in june  contained a full year of earnings compared to gain on sale of investments as part of our ongoing credit evaluation process  all of our mbs are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if they continue to meet our risk and return targets 
this process involves looking at changing market assumptions and the impact those assumptions will have on the individual securities 
as a result of our change in market assumptions  we sold securities and recognized a net gain of approximately million for the year ended december  million  million 
loss on other than temporary impaired securities for the year ended december   we recognized no losses  on other than temporarily impaired securities in the consolidated statement of operations which had been included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
credit losses recognized during on non agency rmbs were anticipated and included in the price paid for the asset at acquisition and were included in the security s estimated yield at acquisition

the increase in equity in earnings and decrease in unrealized income on the change in fair value was primarily the result of realizing gains on investments sold during and a decrease in the fair value of investments remaining in the invesco imrf fund at december  we invested in a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans by contributing million  net of distributions  of equity capital to imrf loan portfolio member llc imrf

index to financial statements other income loss the company finances its activities primarily through repurchase agreements  which are generally settled on a short term basis  usually from one to twelve months 
at each settlement date  the company refinances each repurchase agreement at the market interest rate at that time 
since the interest rate on its repurchase agreements change on a one to twelve month basis  the company is exposed to changing interest rates 
the company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements 
to accomplish this objective  the company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the company making fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount 
our other income loss relates to the unrealized loss on interest rate swaps of approximately   which represents the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of our interest rate swaps which is recognized directly in earnings for the year ended december  expenses for the year ended december   we incurred management fees of million million  million  which are payable to our manager under our management agreement 
the increase in management fees is the result of higher average equity under management as a result of our follow on common stock offerings 
see certain relationships  related transactions  and director independence for a discussion of the management fee and our relationship with our manager 
for the year ended december   our general and administrative expense of approximately million million  million include operating expenses not covered under our management agreement 
these expenses primarily consist of directors and officers insurance  accounting services  auditing and tax services  filing fees  and miscellaneous general and administrative costs 
the increase in costs from to is as a result of our first full year of operation in net income and return on average equity for the year ended december   our net income was million million  million and our annualized return on average equity was  the change in net income and average return on equity was primarily the result of increasing our investment portfolio from the proceeds of our common stock offerings and the changes in our portfolio composition during and liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to pay dividends  fund investments  repayment of borrowings and other general business needs 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consists of the net proceeds from our common equity offerings  net cash provided by operating activities  cash from repurchase agreements and other financing arrangements and future issuances of equity and or debt securities 
we also have sought  and may continue to finance our assets under  and may otherwise participate in  programs established by the us government 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments  repayments on borrowings  margin requirements and the payment of cash dividends as required for continued qualification as a reit 
we generally maintain liquidity to pay down borrowings under repurchase arrangements to reduce borrowing costs and otherwise efficiently manage our long term investment capital 
because the level of these borrowings can be adjusted on a daily basis  the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on our balance sheet is significantly less important than our potential liquidity available under borrowing arrangements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  million 
our cash and cash equivalents increased due to normal fluctuations in cash balances related to the timing of principal and interest payments  repayments of debt  and asset purchases and sales 
our operating activities provided net cash of approximately million for the year ended december  million  million 
the cash provided by operating activities increased due to the increase in net interest income earned by the portfolio which resulted from the increase in average interest earning assets of billion in investments at december  as compared to billion at december  and million at december  our investing activities used net cash of billion for the year ended december  billion  million

index to financial statements respectively 
declines in the value of our securities portfolio can trigger margin calls by our lenders under our repurchase agreements 
an event of default or termination event would give some of our counterparties the option to terminate all repurchase transactions existing with us and require any amount due by us to the counterparties to be payable immediately 
as discussed above under market conditions  the residential mortgage market in the united states has experienced difficult economic conditions including increased volatility of many financial assets  including agency securities and other high quality rmbs assets  due to potential security liquidations  increased volatility and deterioration in the broader residential mortgage and rmbs markets  and significant disruption in financing of rmbs 
if these conditions persist  then our lenders may be forced to exit the repurchase market  become insolvent or further tighten lending standards or increase the amount of required equity capital or haircut  any of which could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing 
in addition  because fannie mae and freddie mac are in conservatorship of the us government  if the us s credit rating is downgraded  it may impact the credit risk associated with agency rmbs and other assets  and  therefore  decrease the value of the agency rmbs  non agency rbms and cmbs in our portfolio  which could cause our repurchase counterparties to make margin calls on our borrowings and swaps  if our collateral is insufficient to cover the debt secured by our assets 
effective as of august   we implemented a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan the drspp  pursuant to which we registered and reserved for issuance  shares of our common stock 
under the terms of the drspp  shareholders who participate in the drspp may purchase shares of our common stock directly from us  in cash investments up to  at our sole discretion  we may accept optional cash investments in excess of  per month  which may qualify for a discount from the market price of to 
the drspp participants may also automatically reinvest all or a portion of their dividends for additional shares of our stock 
we expect to use the proceeds from any dividend reinvestments or stock purchases for general corporate purposes 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock shares under the share purchase feature of our drspp 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of  shares of common stock shares pursuant to dividend reinvestment feature of our drspp 
on december   we announced a share repurchase program that was approved by our board of directors for up to million shares of our common stock 
the shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions  including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with rules b and b under the exchange act or by any combination of such methods 
the manner  price  number and timing of share repurchases will be subject to a variety of factors  including market conditions and applicable sec rules 
as of december   we have not repurchased any shares under this program 
effects of margin requirements  leverage and credit spreads our securities have values that fluctuate according to market conditions and  as discussed above  the market value of our securities will decrease as prevailing interest rates or credit spreads increase 
when the value of the securities pledged to secure a repurchase loan decreases to the point where the positive difference between the collateral value and the loan amount is less than the haircut  our lenders may issue a margin call  which means that the lender will require us to pay the margin call in cash or pledge additional collateral to meet that margin call 
under our repurchase facilities  our lenders have full discretion to determine the value of the securities we pledge to them 
most of our lenders will value securities based on recent trades in the market 
lenders also issue margin calls as the published current principal balance factors change on the pool of mortgages underlying the securities pledged as collateral when scheduled and unscheduled paydowns are announced monthly 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we experience margin calls in the ordinary course of our business 
in seeking to effectively manage the margin requirements established by our lenders  we maintain a position of cash and unpledged securities 
we refer to this position as our liquidity 
the level of liquidity we have available to meet margin calls is directly affected by our leverage levels  our haircuts and the price changes on our securities 
if interest rates increase as a result of a yield curve shift or for another reason or if credit spreads widen  then the prices of our collateral and our unpledged assets that constitute our liquidity will decline  we will experience margin calls  and we will use our liquidity to meet the margin calls 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain sufficient levels of liquidity to meet any margin calls 
if our haircuts increase  our liquidity will proportionately decrease 
in addition  if we increase our borrowings  our liquidity will decrease by the amount of additional haircut on the increased level of indebtedness 
we intend to maintain a level of liquidity in relation to our assets that enables us to meet reasonably anticipated margin calls but that also allows us to be substantially invested in securities 
we may misjudge the appropriate amount of our liquidity by maintaining excessive liquidity  which would lower our investment returns  or by maintaining insufficient liquidity  which would force us to liquidate assets into unfavorable market conditions and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements regarding liquidity based upon our current portfolio  leverage rate and available borrowing arrangements  we believe that cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity  will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short term one year or less liquidity requirements to fund our investment activities  pay fees under our management agreement  fund our distributions to shareholders and for other general corporate expenses 
our ability to meet our long term greater than one year liquidity and capital resource requirements will be subject to obtaining additional debt financing 
we may increase our capital resources by obtaining long term credit facilities or through public or private offerings of equity or debt securities  possibly including classes of preferred stock  common stock  and senior or subordinated notes 
such financing will depend on market conditions for capital raises and our ability to invest such offering proceeds 
if we are unable to renew  replace or expand our sources of financing on substantially similar terms  it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
contractual obligations on july   we entered into an agreement with our manager pursuant to which our manager is entitled to receive a management fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses  which was amended on may  the management fee will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to of our shareholders equity  per annum  calculated and payable quarterly in arrears 
our manager uses the proceeds from its management fee in part to pay compensation to its officers and personnel who  notwithstanding that certain of those individuals are also our officers  receive no cash compensation directly from us 
we are required to reimburse our manager for operating expenses related to us incurred by our manager  including certain salary expenses and other expenses relating to legal  accounting  due diligence and other services 
expense reimbursements to our manager are made in cash on a monthly basis following the end of each month 
our reimbursement obligation is not subject to any dollar limitation 
refer to note related party transactions for details of our reimbursements to our manager 
contractual commitments as of december   we had the following contractual commitments and commercial obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years repurchase agreements equity investments total contractual obligations 
table of contents 
index to financial statements as of december   we have approximately million in contractual interest payments related to our repurchase agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements we committed to invest up to million in the invesco imrf fund  which  in turn  invests in our target assets 
as of december  and  approximately million and million of the commitment has been called  respectively 
we also utilize credit derivatives  such as credit default swaps  to provide credit event protection based on a financial index or specific security in exchange for receiving a fixed rate fee or premium over the term of the contract 
these instruments enable us to synthetically assume the credit risk of a reference security  portfolio of securities or index of securities 
the counterparty pays a premium to us and we agree to make a payment to compensate the counterparty for losses upon the occurrence of a specified credit event 
although contract specific  credit events generally include bankruptcy  failure to pay  restructuring  obligation acceleration  obligation default  or repudiation moratorium 
upon the occurrence of a defined credit event  the difference between the value of the reference obligation and the cds s notional amount is recorded as realized loss in the statement of operations 
our only cds contract was entered into on december  with a million notional balance where we sold protection on a specific pool of non agency rmbs that exceed a specified loss limit of for a stated fixed rate fee of 
our maximum exposure is the unpaid principal balance of the underlying rmbs that exceeds the specified loss limit 
we posted cash collateral to secure potential loss payments of million as of december  the remaining notional amount of the cds at december  is million compared to million at december   and we estimated the fair market value of the cds to be approximately million at december  compared to million at december  as of december   we have not made any payments related to the cds contract

unrealized gains and losses since we account for our investment securities as available for sale  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our us gaap income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements carrying value of the asset and shareholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  unrealized fluctuations in market values of our cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting are also reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for the year ended december   net unrealized losses included in shareholders equity is million million gain  million gain 
the net unrealized loss is primarily attributable to changes in the market values of our cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting 
refer to note mortgage backed securities and note derivative and hedging activities for more details on the unrealized gains and losses in both our investment securities and our cash flow hedges 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
share based compensation we established the equity incentive plan for grants of restricted common stock and other equity based awards to our independent  non executive directors  and to the officers and employees of the manager the incentive plan 
under the incentive plan  a total of  shares are currently reserved for issuance 
unless terminated earlier  the incentive plan will terminate in  but will continue to govern the unexpired awards 
our three independent  non executive directors are each eligible to receive  in restricted common stock annually 
for the year ended december   we recognized compensation expense of approximately    and issued  shares  shares  shares of restricted stock to our independent  non executive directors pursuant to the incentive plan 
the number of shares issued was determined based on the closing price on the nyse on the actual date of grant 
dividends we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock 
us federal income tax law generally requires that a reit distribute annually at least of its reit taxable income  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains  and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than of its taxable income 
we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders in an amount equal at least of our net taxable income 
before we pay any dividend  whether for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise  we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our repurchase agreements and other debt payable 
if our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income  we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions  or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
other matters we calculate that we satisfied each of the asset tests in section c of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code at the end of each calendar quarter in we also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the source of income test and for the source of income test rules for the taxable year ended december  consequently  we believe that we met the reit income and asset test for we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of dividends for the taxable year ended december  therefore  as of december   we believe that we qualified as a reit under the code

index to financial statements at all times  we intend to conduct our business so that neither we nor our operating partnership nor the subsidiaries of our operating partnership are required to register as an investment company under the act 
if we were required to register as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
because we are a holding company that conducts our business through our operating partnership and the operating partnership s wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries  the securities issued by these subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of investment company under section c or section c of the act  together with any other investment securities the operating partnership may own  may not have a combined value in excess of of the value of the operating partnership s total assets exclusive of us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis  which we refer to as the test 
this requirement limits the types of businesses in which we are permitted to engage in through our subsidiaries 
in addition  we believe neither we nor the operating partnership are considered an investment company under section a a of the act because they do not engage primarily or hold themselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities 
rather  through the operating partnership s wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries  we and the operating partnership are primarily engaged in the non investment company businesses of these subsidiaries 
ias asset i llc and certain of the operating partnership s other subsidiaries that we may form in the future rely upon the exclusion from the definition of investment company under the act provided by section c c of the act  which is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate 
this exclusion generally requires that at least of each subsidiary s portfolio be comprised of qualifying assets and at least be comprised of qualifying assets and real estate related assets and no more than comprised of miscellaneous assets 
qualifying assets for this purpose include mortgage loans fully secured by real estate and other assets  such as whole pool agency and non agency rmbs  that the sec or its staff in various no action letters has determined are the functional equivalent of mortgage loans fully secured by real estate 
we treat as real estate related assets cmbs  debt and equity securities of companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses  agency partial pool certificates and securities issued by pass through entities of which substantially all of the assets consist of qualifying assets and or real estate related assets 
additionally  unless certain mortgage securities represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  the mbs may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculate that as of december   we conducted our business so as not to be regulated as an investment company under the act 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary components of our market risk are related to interest rate  prepayment and market value 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and we seek to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations  and other factors beyond our control 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments and our repurchase agreements 
our repurchase agreements are typically of limited duration and will be periodically refinanced at current market rates 
we mitigate this risk through utilization of derivative contracts  primarily interest rate swap agreements  interest rate caps and interest rate floors 
interest rate effect on net interest income our operating results depend in large part upon differences between the yields earned on our investments and our cost of borrowing and interest rate hedging activities 
most of our repurchase agreements provide financing based on a floating rate of interest calculated on a fixed spread over libor 
the fixed spread will vary depending on the type of underlying asset which collateralizes the financing 
accordingly  the portion of our portfolio which consists of floating interest rate assets are match funded utilizing our expected sources of short term financing  while our fixed interest rate assets are not match funded 
during periods of rising interest rates  the borrowing costs associated with our investments tend to increase while the income earned on our fixed interest rate investments may 
table of contents 
index to financial statements remain substantially unchanged 
this increase in borrowing costs results in the narrowing of the net interest spread between the related assets and borrowings and may even result in losses 
further  during this portion of the interest rate and credit cycles  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
such delinquencies or defaults could also have an adverse effect on the spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our rmbs 
if prepayments are slower or faster than assumed  the life of the rmbs will be longer or shorter  which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions 
hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns 
interest rate effects on fair value another component of interest rate risk is the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the market value of the assets that we acquire 
we face the risk that the market value of our assets will increase or decrease at different rates than those of our liabilities  including our hedging instruments 
we primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets and the duration of our liabilities 
duration measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change 
we generally calculate duration using various financial models and empirical data 
different models and methodologies can produce different duration numbers for the same securities 
the impact of changing interest rates on fair value can change significantly when interest rates change materially 
therefore  the volatility in the fair value of our assets could increase significantly in the event interest rates change materially 
in addition  other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments and hedging instruments  such as the shape of the yield curve  market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions 
accordingly  changes in actual interest rates may have a material adverse effect on us 
prepayment risk as we receive prepayments of principal on our investments  premiums paid on these investments are amortized against interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the interest income earned on the investments 
conversely  discounts on such investments are accreted into interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the accretion of purchase discounts  thereby increasing the interest income earned on the investments 
extension risk we compute the projected weighted average life of our investments based upon assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgages 
in general  when a fixed rate or hybrid adjustable rate security is acquired with borrowings  we may  but are not required to  enter into an interest rate swap agreement or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets 
this strategy is designed to protect us from rising interest rates  because the borrowing costs are fixed for the duration of the fixed rate portion of the related target asset 
however  if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment  then the life of the fixed rate portion of the related assets could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument 
this could have a negative impact on our results from operations  as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the end of the hedging instrument  while the income earned on the hybrid adjustable rate assets would remain fixed 
this situation may also cause the market value of our hybrid adjustable rate assets to decline  with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur losses

index to financial statements market risk market value risk our available for sale securities are reflected at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income pursuant to asc topic the estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to increase 
the sensitivity analysis table presented below shows the estimated impact of an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve  up and down and basis points  on the market value of our interest rate sensitive investments and net interest income  at december   assuming a static portfolio 
when evaluating the impact of changes in interest rates  prepayment assumptions and principal reinvestment rates are adjusted based on our manager s expectations 
the analysis presented utilized assumptions  models and estimates of our manager based on our manager s judgment and experience 
change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value real estate risk residential and commercial property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as the supply of housing stock  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  age and design  demographic factors  and retroactive changes to building or similar codes 
in addition  decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
credit risk we believe that our investment strategy will generally keep our credit losses and financing costs low 
however  we retain the risk of potential credit losses on all of the residential and commercial mortgage loans  as well as the loans underlying the non agency rmbs and cmbs in our portfolio 
we seek to manage this risk through our pre acquisition due diligence process and through the use of non recourse financing  which limits our exposure to credit losses to the specific pool of mortgages that are subject to the non recourse financing 
in addition  with respect to any particular asset  our manager s investment team evaluates  among other things  relative valuation  supply and demand trends  shape of yield curves  prepayment rates  delinquency and default rates  recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral 
risk management to the extent consistent with maintaining our reit qualification  we seek to manage risk exposure to protect our investment portfolio against the effects of major interest rate changes 
we generally seek to manage this risk by monitoring and adjusting  if necessary  the reset index and interest rate related to our target assets and our financings  attempting to structure our financing agreements to have a range of different maturities  terms  amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods
