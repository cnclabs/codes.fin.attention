the following table reconciles net income loss to adjusted ebitda for the periods presented and is unaudited september  september  september  september  september  years ended december  in thousands net income loss interest and other income  net provision for benefit from income taxes depreciation amortization of intangible assets amortization of purchase price adjustment for earnouts ebitda stock based compensation restructuring charge adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a metric used by management when reviewing our performance 
ebitda represents net income loss before interest and other income expense net  provision for benefit from income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda represents ebitda as further adjusted to exclude stock based compensation and restructuring charges 
we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses  the age and book depreciation of fixed assets affecting relative depreciation expense  acquisition related charges such as amortization of intangible assets and earnouts and the impact of non cash stock based compensation expense costs 
because adjusted ebitda facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use adjusted ebitda in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors 
we also use adjusted ebitda in connection with our compensation of our executive officers and senior management 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  operating income loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
we understand that although adjusted ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of companies  adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure

kwit was an existing techtarget partner which operates chinese language versions of some of our websites 
prc laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of internet related services and advertising businesses 
to comply with these foreign ownership restrictions  we operate our websites and provide online advertising services in the prc through this vie

on november   we filed a form k disclosing that we were delaying the filing of our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of we further disclosed that we had identified an improper accounting practice relating to certain customer credits that were improperly eliminated as liabilities on our balance sheet 
as a result  our audit committee conducted an investigation into this matter and concluded that there were certain errors in our previously reported financial statements 
to correct the customer credit errors  we recorded a net adjustment which increased accounts payable by million and decreased income before provision for income taxes by million in the aggregate net adjustment accumulated over several years and included  from to  million from  million from and  from in addition to the customer credit matter mentioned above  we disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of that we corrected in the first quarter of an error in the amount of million related to interest income which should have been recorded in the fourth quarter of whereas the error was previously corrected in q  the million adjustment is not included in the adjustments described above 
we assessed the materiality of these errors  both quantitatively and qualitatively  and concluded that the adjustments were not material to the prior annual financial statements or to the interim financial statements for sources of revenues we sell advertising programs to it vendors targeting a specific audience within a particular it sector or sub sector 
we maintain multiple points of contact with our customers to provide support throughout their organizations and the sales cycle 
as a result  our customers often run multiple advertising programs with us in order to reach discrete portions of our targeted audience 
there are multiple factors that can impact our customers advertising objectives and spending with us  including but not limited to  product launches  increases or decreases to their advertising budgets  the timing of key industry marketing events  responses to competitor activities and efforts to address specific marketing objectives such as creating brand awareness or generating sales leads 
our services are generally delivered under short term contracts that run for the length of a given advertising program  typically less than six months 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from the sale of targeted advertising campaigns which we deliver via our network of websites and in person events 
online 
the majority of our revenue is derived from the delivery of our online offerings from our media groups 
online revenue represented  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect the majority of our revenues to be derived through the delivery of online offerings for the foreseeable future 
as a result of our customers advertising objectives and preferences  the specific allocation of online advertising offerings sold and delivered by us  on a period by period basis  can fluctuate 

table of contents through our websites we sell a variety of online media offerings to connect it vendors to it professionals 
our lead generation offerings allow it vendors to capture qualified sales leads from the distribution and promotion of content to our audience of it professionals 
our branding offerings provide it vendors exposure to targeted audiences of it professionals actively researching information related to their products and services 
our branding offerings include display advertising and custom offerings 
display advertising can be purchased on specific websites within our network and against specific technology segments 
our custom offerings allow customers to have content or entire micro sites created that focus on topics related to their marketing objectives and include promotion of these vehicles to the techtarget audience 
these offerings give it vendors the ability to increase their brand awareness to highly specialized it sectors 
our lead generation offerings include the following white papers 
white papers are technical documents created by it vendors to describe business or technical problems that are addressed by the vendors products or services 
it vendors pay us to have their white papers distributed to our users and receive targeted promotions on our relevant websites 
prior to viewing white papers  our registered members and visitors supply their corporate contact information and agree to receive further information from the vendor 
the corporate contact and other qualification information for these leads are supplied to the vendor in real time through our proprietary lead management solution 
webcasts  podcasts  videocasts and virtual trade shows 
it vendors pay us to sponsor and host webcasts  podcasts  videocasts  virtual trade shows and similar content which bring informational sessions directly to attendees desktops and  in the case of podcasts  directly to their mobile devices 
as is the case with white papers  we supply our users corporate contact and qualification information to the webcast  podcast  videocast or virtual trade show sponsor after the users view or download the content 
sponsorship includes access to the registrant information and visibility before  during and after the event 
custom content creation 
in support of our advertisers lead generation programs  we will sometimes create white papers  case studies  webcasts  or videos to our customers specifications through our custom media team 
these content assets are then promoted to our audience in the context of the advertisers lead generation programs 
content sponsorships 
it vendors pay us to sponsor editorially created content vehicles on specific technology topics  such as e zines  e books  and e guides 
in some cases  these vehicles are supported by multiple sponsors in a single segment  with the registrant information provided to all participating sponsors 
because these offerings are editorially driven  advertisers get the benefit of association with independently created content  and access to qualified sales leads that are researching the topic 
list rentals 
we also offer it vendors the ability to message relevant registered members on topics related to their interests 
it vendors can rent our e mail and postal lists of registered members using specific criteria such as company size  geography or job title 
third party revenue sharing arrangements 
we have arrangements with certain third parties  including for the licensing of our online content  for the renting of our database of opted in e mail subscribers and for which advertising from customers of certain third parties is made available to our website visitors 
in each of these arrangements we are paid a share of the resulting revenue 
events 
events revenue represented  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
most of our media groups operate revenue generating events 
the majority of our events are free to it professionals and are sponsored by it vendors 
attendees are pre screened based on event specific criteria such as sector specific budget size  company size  or job title 
we offer three types of events multi day conferences  single day seminars and custom events 
multi day conferences provide independent expert content for our attendees and allow vendors to purchase exhibit space and other sponsorship offerings that enable interaction with the attendees 
we also hold single day seminars on various topics in major cities 
these seminars provide independent content on key sub topics in the sectors we serve  are free to qualified attendees  and offer multiple vendors the ability to interact with specific  targeted audiences actively focused on buying decisions 
our custom events differ from our seminars in that they are exclusively sponsored by a single it vendor  and the content is driven primarily by the sole sponsor

general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  facilities expenses  accounting  legal and other professional fees  and stock based compensation expenses

depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from two to ten years 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets expense consists of the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their useful lives  which range from one to nine years  using methods that are expected to reflect the estimated pattern of economic use

application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue  long lived assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
we based our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information about these critical accounting policies as well as a description of our other accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of targeted advertising campaigns which we deliver via our network of websites and events 
in all cases  we recognize revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
during fiscal and prior  because objective evidence of fair value did not exist for all elements in our bundled advertising campaigns  no allocation could be made among the various elements  so we recognized revenue as one unit of accounting ratably over the term of the arrangement 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified accounting standards update asu  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance included in asc asu requires companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable by using a best estimate of selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or other third party evidence of selling price 
we adopted the new standard  beginning on january   on a prospective basis 
although each of our online media offerings can be sold separately  most of our online media sales involve multiple online offerings 
because objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements in our bundled advertising campaigns  we use a best estimate of selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or other third party evidence of selling price 
we establish best estimates considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  class of client  size of transaction  available media inventory  pricing strategies and market conditions 
we believe the use of the best estimate of selling price allows revenue recognition in a manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction 
we apply a relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of the arrangement to each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement 
revenue is then recognized as delivery occurs 
for content assets posted on websites  revenue recognition is generally over the period the content asset is available 
we evaluate all deliverables of an arrangement at inception and each time an item is delivered  to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
based on this evaluation  once we have determined that elements for lead generation  branding and events have separate stand alone value  the arrangement consideration is measured and allocated to each of these elements 
event sponsorships 
we sell our events separately from our other service offerings and recognize sponsorship revenue from events in the period in which the event occurs 
the majority of our events are free to qualified attendees  however  certain events are based on a paid attendee model 
we recognize revenue for paid attendee events upon completion of the event and receipt of payment from the attendee 
amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
online media 
we recognize revenue from our specific online media offerings as follows when these items are sold separately white papers 
we recognize white paper revenue ratably over the period in which the white paper is available on our websites 
webcasts  podcasts  videocasts and virtual trade shows 
we recognize webcast  podcast  videocast  virtual trade show and similar content offerings revenue ratably over the period in which the webcast  podcast  videocast  virtual trade show or similar content offering is available on our websites 
custom content creation 
custom content revenue is recognized when the creation is completed and delivered to the customer 
content sponsorships 
we recognize content sponsorship revenue ratably over the period in which the related content vehicle is available on our websites 
list rentals 
we recognize list rental revenue in the period in which the list is sent to our customers 
banners 
we recognize banner revenue in the period in which the banner impressions or clicks occur 
third party revenue sharing arrangements 
revenue from third party revenue sharing arrangements is recognized on a net basis in the period in which the services are performed 
for certain third party agreements where we are the primary obligor  revenue is recognized on a gross basis in the period in which the services are performed 
we recognize revenue from cost per lead advertising in the period during which the leads are delivered 
we offer customers the ability to purchase integrated roi program offerings  which can include any of our online media offerings described above packaged together to address the particular customer s specific advertising requirements 
as part of these offerings  we will guarantee a minimum number of qualified sales leads to be delivered over the course of the advertising campaign 
we sometimes need to extend the scheduled end date of advertising campaigns to satisfy lead guarantees or to fulfill all elements of the campaign based on various factors  including delayed receipt of advertising media collateral from the customer 
we estimate the revenue reserve necessary to properly defer revenue recognition for extended advertising campaigns 
these estimates are based on our experience in managing and fulfilling these integrated roi program offerings 
our services are generally delivered under short term contracts that run for the length of a given advertising program  typically less than six months 
our standard terms and conditions do not provide for a general right of return on any items that have been delivered 
amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 

table of contents long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets have arisen principally from our acquisitions 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on our estimates of the future benefit of the intangible assets using accepted valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determined based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to nine years  using methods of amortization that are expected to reflect the estimated pattern of economic use 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  other than goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually  and whenever indicators of impairment are present 
fair value of financial instruments financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
the carrying value of these instruments approximates their estimated fair values 
allowance for doubtful accounts we offset gross trade accounts receivable with an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis  and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
provisions for allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expense 
if our historical collection experience does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable  our future provision for doubtful accounts could be materially affected 
to date  we have not incurred any write offs of accounts receivable significantly different than the amounts reserved 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize stock based compensation in the statement of operations using the straight line method over the vesting period of the award or using the accelerated method if the award is contingent upon performance goals 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards 
we calculated the fair values of the options granted using the following estimated weighted average assumptions years ended december  expected volatility expected term years years years risk free interest rate expected dividend yield weighted average grant date fair value per share as there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering in may  and there has been limited historical information on the volatility of our common stock since the date of our initial public offering  we determined the volatility for options granted in  and based on an analysis of the historical volatility of our stock and reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted has been determined using a weighted average of the historical volatility of our stock and the peer group of companies for a period equal to the expected life of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on a zero coupon united states treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
we applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate based on our historical forfeiture experience of  and in determining the expense recorded in the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents internal use software and website development costs we capitalize costs of materials  consultants and compensation and related expenses of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software and website applications and infrastructure involving developing software to operate our websites 
however  we expense as incurred website development costs for new features and functionalities since it is not probable that they will result in additional functionality until they are both developed and tested with confirmation that they are more effective than the current set of features and functionalities on our websites 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the states at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  which is generally three years 
to the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our websites  assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  the amount of website development costs we capitalize and amortize in future periods would be impacted 
we review capitalized internal use software and website development costs for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
we capitalized internal use software and website development costs of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of book to tax differences on stock based compensation and net operating loss nol carryforwards 
as of december   we had state nol carryforwards of approximately million  which may be used to offset future taxable income 
the nol carryforwards expire through net income loss per share we calculate basic earnings per share eps by dividing earnings available to common shareholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares and vested  undelivered restricted stock awards 
because the holders of unvested restricted stock awards do not have nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents  we do not consider these awards to be participating securities that should be included in our computation of earnings per share under the two class method 
diluted eps is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and vested  undelivered restricted stock awards during the period  plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method 
in calculating diluted eps  the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock awards is computed using the average market price for the respective period 
in addition  the assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the average unrecognized compensation expense and assumed tax benefit of stock options and restricted stock awards that are in the money 
this results in the assumed buyback of additional shares  thereby reducing the dilutive impact of stock options 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods indicated september  september  september  september  september  september  years ended december  in thousands revenues online events total revenues cost of revenues online events total cost of revenues gross profit

the increase in online revenue was primarily attributable to a million increase in lead generation offerings  primarily due to an increase in sponsorship and white paper sales volumes 
branding revenues also increased by million  due primarily to an increase in banner sales volume  and third party revenue increased by million 
events 
the increase in events revenue is due to the addition of a new multi day conference in that was not held in  offset in part by an overall reduction in custom events and seminars 
cost of revenues and gross profit september  september  september  september  years ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands cost of revenues online events total cost of revenues gross profit gross profit percentage cost of online revenue 
the increase in cost of online revenues was a result of the increase in online revenue and was primarily attributable to a million increase in hosting and production costs  primarily related to increased international partner activity and freelancer costs  and a million increase in payroll related expenses due to increased headcount 
cost of events revenue 
cost of events revenues increased in as compared to  primarily due to costs related to the new multi day conference added in as well as an overall increase in the number of single day events and change in the overall mix of event types 

table of contents gross profit 
our gross profit is equal to the difference between our revenues and our cost of revenues for the period 
gross margin for and was 
online gross profit increased million  attributable to the increase in online revenue offset by increases in hosting and production and compensation costs as compared to events gross profit was flat 
because the majority of our costs are labor related  we expect our gross profit to fluctuate from period to period depending on the total revenues for the period  as well as the relative contribution of online and events revenues to our total revenues 
operating expenses and other september  september  september  september  years ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands operating expenses selling and marketing product development general and administrative restructuring depreciation amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses interest and other income  net provision for income taxes selling and marketing 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses is primarily due to a million increase in compensation and related benefits costs due to increased headcount  including hiring expenses and the use of temporary labor during the recruitment process  and a million increase in facilities  travel and employee related costs due primarily to increased headcount and the costs associated with international expansion 
in april we acquired the operations of computer weekly and microscope from reed business information limited and inherited as a result of this acquisition additional headcount and ongoing expenses that have mainly been composed of sales and marketing expenses 
these increases were offset in part by a million decrease in stock based compensation due to the accelerated vesting of performance based awards in product development 
the decrease in product development expense was primarily caused by a million reduction in payroll and allocated costs due to these costs being capitalized at higher levels resulting from our ongoing internal development projects  specifically activity intelligence and jee upgrade  a million reduction in consulting costs and a million reduction in stock based compensation  primarily due to the accelerated vesting of performance based awards in general and administrative 
the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a million reduction in stock based compensation  primarily due to the accelerated vesting of performance based awards in  a million decrease in audit and compliance fees and a million decrease in corporate taxes due to a potential net worth tax liability recorded in these decreases were offset in part by a million change in the fair value adjustments related to the earnout provisions of the two acquisitions and a million increase in legal fees  primarily related to acquisitions 
restructuring charge 
the restructuring charge was for redundancy costs related to the computer weekly acquisition 
depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 
the increase in depreciation expense is related to our increased fixed asset base  primarily as a result of our continued investment in internal use software development costs and computer equipment as well as leasehold improvements associated with our move to the new corporate headquarters on march  the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense was primarily attributable to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during  partially offset by amortization on newly acquired intangible assets 
interest and other income  net

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk our subsidiary  techtarget limited  was established in july and is located in london  england 
in august our hong kong subsidiary  techtarget hk limited  was formed in order to facilitate the company s activities in the asia pacific region 
we also have a sales office in india and a vie in beijing  china 
less than of our revenues for the twelve months ended december  were derived from advertisers located outside of north america and our foreign exchange gains losses were not significant 
we currently believe our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is financially immaterial and therefore have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency futures or options in the future 
interest rate risk at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market accounts and municipal bonds 
the cash  cash equivalents and investments were held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
our exposure to market risk also relates to the amount of interest expense we must pay under our revolving credit facility 
the advances under this credit facility bear a variable rate of interest determined as a function of the lender s prime rate or libor 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility
