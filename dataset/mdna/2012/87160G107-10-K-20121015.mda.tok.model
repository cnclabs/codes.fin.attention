md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated audited financial statements and accompanying notes 
this overview summarizes the md a  which includes the following sections 
table of contents our business a general description of the key drivers that affect our business and the industries in which we operate 
our business strategy a description of the strategic initiatives on which we focus and the goals we seek to achieve

our business the company is a medical device company 
through continuous improvement and development of our people  our mission is to design  manufacture and market innovative surgical devices  surgical equipment and consumables of the highest quality in order to assist and enable surgeons who perform surgery around the world to provide a better quality of life for their patients 
the company s primary focus is on the surgical disciplines of ophthalmology vitreoretinal and neurosurgery 
our distribution channels include a combination of direct and independent sales organizations and important strategic alliances with market leaders 
the company s product lines focus upon precision engineered disposable and reusable devices  surgical equipment  procedural kits and the delivery of laser energy  ultrasound  electrosurgery  aspiration  illumination and irrigation  often delivered in multiple combinations 
enterprise wide sales information is included in note to the consolidated audited financial statements 
demand trends the company s sales increased percent during the fiscal year ended july  including million of deferred revenue recognized compared with the previous fiscal year 
the two most significant factors impacting this increase were a  increase in ophthalmic sales and a million increase in oem sales 
the increased sales were partially offset by an  decrease in our other sales due to the transition of the majority of our direct neurosurgery product sales to our marketing partners 
currently  disposable product sales account for approximately percent of our total products sales 
overall sales of our disposable products grew million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal sales of capital equipment declined by approximately  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to continued weak demand for capital equipment given a more cautious capital spending environment 
a study performed by market scope in february predicts a steady growth of percent per year in retinal procedures worldwide driven by an increase in the elderly population worldwide  an increase in the number of surgeons  an increase in the number of diseases treated with vitrectomy and an increase in frequency of diabetic complications due to the obesity epidemic 
on a dollar basis  we estimate that the vitreoretinal market will grow approximately seven percent to million in neurosurgical procedures on a global basis continue to rise at an estimated to percent growth rate driven by an aging global population  new technologies  advances in surgical techniques and a growing global market resulting from ongoing improvements in healthcare delivery in third world countries  among other factors 
based upon this growth in procedures  sales of neurosurgical products worldwide are forecasted to increase by approximately percent 

table of contents in addition  the company believes that the demand for high quality  innovative products and new technologies consistent with the company s devices and disposables will continue to favorably impact procedure growth in the ophthalmic and neurosurgical markets 
strong orders from the emerging markets of brazil  russia and india offset weakness in other international markets which faced continued economic challenges and competitive factors in the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year 
pricing trends the company has generally been able to maintain the average selling prices for its products in the face of downward pricing pressure in the healthcare industry 
however  increased competition in the company s capital equipment market segments  in combination with customer budget constraints  capital scarcity and the transition of procedures to the ambulatory surgery center  has the potential to negatively impact the company s selling prices on these devices 
the company has no major domestic group purchasing agreements 
economic trends economic conditions may continue to negatively impact capital expenditures at the hospital  ambulatory surgical center and physician level 
further  global economic conditions continue to negatively impact the volume and average selling price of the company s products in its european markets 
regulatory developments in march  significant us healthcare reform legislation  the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of  was enacted into law 
as a us headquartered company with significant sales in the united states  this new law will likely have a material impact on our results of operations 
a number of provisions of the new health care reform legislation is not yet finalized and effective  and as such  we are unable to predict the full impact of the laws and regulations promulgated thereunder 
among other matters  the law imposes a percent excise tax on all us medical device sales beginning in january approximately of our consolidated fiscal sales were in the us if we are unable to offset the taxes that will be levied on these sales  such as through the increase of efficiencies through our lean manufacturing initiatives  we expect that the new tax will materially and adversely affect our business  cash flows and results of operations 
the law also focuses on a number of medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs and include provisions such as value based payment programs and increased funding of comparative research 
furthermore  the law includes a reduction in the annual rate of inflation for hospitals that began in and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board to recommend ways of reducing the rate of growth in medicare spending beginning in we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level  or the effect of any future legislation or regulation 
however  any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business strategy the company s key strategy is to enhance shareholder value through profitable revenue growth in ophthalmology and neurosurgery markets 
this is accomplished through the identification and development of reusable and disposable devices and surgical equipment in conjunction with leading surgeons and marketing partners 
we are committed to establishing a strong operational infrastructure and financial foundation within which growth opportunities can be prudently evaluated  financed and implemented 
we will remain vigilant and sensitive to new challenges which may arise from changes in the definition and delivery of appropriate healthcare in our fields of interest 
in fiscal and continuing through fiscal  our strategic priorities are to drive the company onto a higher growth trajectory and to continue to enhance the profitability of our operational platform by focusing on manufacturing efficiencies

at july   the company had days of inventory on hand 
the inventory on hand was unfavorable by days when compared to july  and july  utilizing the trailing twelve months of cost of sales 
the company had invested approximately million in inventory for new products and new product launches at the end of fiscal however  the company had million in backlog as of july  we are currently working to determine the appropriate inventory levels to exceed industry service levels 

table of contents cash flows used by operating activities were million for the year ended july   compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of approximately million for the comparable fiscal period 
the decrease of approximately million was primarily attributable to the decrease in income taxes payable of million  an increase in inventory of million  the decrease in deferred revenues of million and the decrease in accrued expenses of  this decrease was partially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes  a million increase in accounts receivable  an  increase in accounts payable  a  increase in stock compensation and various other adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided of  cash flows used by investing activities were million for the year ended july   compared to cash used by investing activities of million for the comparable fiscal period

equipment line of credit under this credit facility  the company may borrow up to million  with interest currently at one month libor plus percent 
pursuant to the terms of the equipment line of credit  under no circumstance shall the rate be less than percent per annum 
the unused portion of the facility is not charged a fee 
there were no borrowings under this line as of july  the equipment line of credit was amended on november  to extend the maturity date to november  management believes that cash flows from operations  together with available cash  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next twelve months 
in addition  the remaining deferred revenue from the alcon settlement will flow through our statement of income over approximately the next years 
however  as the cash has already been collected  it will not impact our future liquidity and will reduce our cash flow from operations 
contractual obligations the company has entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments 
the following illustrates the company s contractual obligations as of july 
table of contents payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases total contractual obligations we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease 
our future cash payment would change if we exercised these renewal options or if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the financial results of the company are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition the company primarily records revenue from product sales when the revenue is realized and the product is shipped from its facilities 
this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident  usually through receipt of a purchase order  the sales price is fixed and determinable  delivery to the carrier has occurred  and collectability is reasonably ensured 
freight and shipping billed to customers is included in net sales  and the cost of shipping is included in cost of sales 
sales tax billed to customers is included as a liability as products are shipped 
the terms and conditions of sales to both our domestic and international distributors do not differ materially from the terms and conditions of sales to our domestic and international end user customers 
service revenue substantially relates to repairs of products and is recognized when the service has been completed 
revenue from royalty fees is recorded as the products bearing the trademark are shipped 
deferred revenue on april   the company entered into a settlement and license agreement with alcon pursuant to which alcon paid to the company million 
the net proceeds to the company were million after contingency payments to attorneys 
the company recognized a gain from this agreement of million in the third quarter of fiscal the remaining million has been accounted for as an up front license fee under the confidential settlement and license agreement and was deferred and recognized as earned over a period currently estimated to be years based upon estimated shipments to alcon under a related supply agreement executed pursuant to the settlement 
on february   alcon informed the company that it had decided to cancel the project  orders and forecasts covering the two products to have been supplied under the supply agreement 
however  the supply agreement remains in effect and the company has continuing performance obligations associated with the supply agreement 
therefore  the company plans on recognizing the remaining deferred revenue associated with the supply agreement ratably over the next years which is the remaining life of the patents and associated supply agreement 
the company recognized million and  of this deferred revenue for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method  or market 
the company s inventory is very dynamic and new products are added frequently 
thus  the company reviews the valuation of its inventory on a quarterly basis and determines if a valuation allowance is necessary for items that have not had their values updated recently 
in addition  the company evaluates inventories for excess quantities and identified obsolescence quarterly 
the company s evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand  as well as estimates of quantities required to support warranty and other repairs 
to the extent that it determines there are some excess quantities based on its projected levels of sales and other requirements  or obsolete material in inventory  it records valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related parts or products 
if future cost valuations  future demand or market conditions are different from the company s projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 

table of contents amortization periods the company records amortization of intangible assets using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets 
it bases the determination of these useful lives on the period over which it expects the related assets to contribute to its cash flows or in the case of patents  their legal life  whichever is shorter 
if the company s assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  it may change future amortization expense see impairment of long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to the company  the company records an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that management reasonably expects to collect 
for all other customers  the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and historical experience 
accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received 
the company generally does not charge interest on past due amounts in accounts receivable 
the company has a history of minimal uncollectible accounts 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  the company may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 
patents and research and development incremental legal and other costs to obtain patents are capitalized to a patent asset 
salaries  benefits and other direct costs of product development are expensed as operating expenses in r d costs 
patents are amortized to operations under the straight line method over the shorter of the remaining statutory life of the patent or the cash flow stream associated with that patent 
goodwill as of july   we have recorded million of goodwill 
we perform purchase price allocations including recognition of intangible assets when we make a business combination 
the excess of the purchase price after the allocation of fair values to tangible assets and identifiable intangibles is allocated to goodwill 
we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized and whether the assets have finite or indefinite lives for amortization purposes 
currently  we have one reporting unit 
we perform our annual impairment test on goodwill in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc absent any impairment indicators  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis 
the company performs its impairment tests during the fourth fiscal quarter 
our tests may include three approaches to determine the fair value of our reporting unit 
the first approach is discounted cash flows  which focuses on our expected cash flows available for common equity owners 
net cash flows to equity is defined as our earnings plus depreciation  amortization and interest expense  or ebitda  less our estimated usage of cash for debt  capital expenditures and working capital changes 
the resulting net cash flows and the terminal value our value of invested capital at the end of the five year projection period are then discounted to derive an indication of the present value of the company s invested capital 
interest bearing debt is then subtracted to arrive at the company s fair value of equity 
this valuation method is dependent upon management s assumptions made regarding future cash flow and cash requirements and the discount factor used to determine the present value of our future cash flows 
if necessary  we would also analyze two additional valuation methods the guideline company approach and the market capitalization approach 
the guideline company approach focuses on comparing the company to selected reasonably similar  publicly traded companies 
under this approach  valuation multiples are i derived from operating data of selected similar companies  ii evaluated and adjusted based on our strengths and weaknesses relative to this selected group of guideline companies  and iii applied to our revenues and ebitda to arrive at an indication of invested capital 
interest bearing debt is subtracted and a control premium and cash balances are added to arrive at the fair value of the company s equity 
this valuation approach is dependent upon the assumption that our value can be evaluated by analysis of our earnings and strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected similar companies and an appropriate control premium can be determined 
the market capitalization approach focuses on the company s market capitalization over a period of time and applies a control premium to arrive at an indication of fair value 
this valuation approach is dependent upon the performance of our stock and the control premiums utilized in acquisitions completed in the healthcare equipment and supplies industry 

table of contents the fair value determined under the discounted cash flows methodology in fiscal resulted in an indication of value which exceeded the book value of the reporting unit by approximately percent 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions or the company s operating performance could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
other intangibles as of july   we have recorded million of indefinite lived intangible assets for the malis trademark 
the life of a trademark is inextricably related to the life of the product bearing the mark or the life of the business entity owning the trademark 
the company intends to use the trademark indefinitely  and therefore  its useful life is not limited to any specific product 
we perform impairment tests on the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually at the end of july or sooner if we identify an event suggesting possible impairment of the value of this asset 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment using the discounted cash flow methodology  which focuses on our expected cash flows derived from the use of the intangible asset 
with respect to the trademark  the expected cash flows are reduced by the related income taxes and debt 
the indication of value for the trademark exceeds its book value by approximately percent as of july  significant and unanticipated changes to either the market for the malis branded products or our contract authorizing the use of the malis trademark could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the group of assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes asc topic  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
asc topic also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if its more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset not be realized 
in our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income in our tax jurisdictions and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from these assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance  we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period this determination is made 
at july   we had deferred tax assets related to net foreign operating loss carryforwards with a tax value of million 
these net foreign operating loss carryforwards have various expiration dates  depending on the country and period in which they occurred 
the company has not established a valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets based upon the company s ability to use these losses by implementing tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income and the expiration dates of these carryforwards 

table of contents in addition  the calculations of our tax liabilities involve dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulation 
on august   we adopted the provisions of asc topic related to uncertain tax positions 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of certain outcomes 
we reevaluate these positions on a quarterly basis including an analysis of changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues or net audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of an additional charge to the tax provision 
stock based compensation the company utilizes fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation in accounting for its employee stock options 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the directors and employees requisite service period 
compensation expense is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
of the inputs into the black scholes option pricing model  the one that can impact the value of the options the most is the volatility factor 
for awards occurring in fiscal year ended july   the company has utilized a volatility factor of percent in this calculation 
in addition  the company utilized an expected average risk free interest rate of percent  an expected average life of years and no expected dividends 
recent accounting pronouncements information about recent accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated audited financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rate variability 
the company has million in cash and cash equivalents with a substantial portion of this cash held in short term money market funds bearing interest at basis points 
interest income from these funds is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
a reduction in the interest on these funds to basis points would decrease the amount of interest income from these funds by approximately  the company currently has a revolving credit facility and an equipment line of credit facility in place 
the revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance at july   bearing interest at a current rate of libor plus percent 
the equipment line of credit facility had no outstanding balance at july   bearing interest at one month libor plus percent 
interest expense from these credit facilities is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
because the current levels of borrowings are zero  there would be no market risk associated with the interest rates
