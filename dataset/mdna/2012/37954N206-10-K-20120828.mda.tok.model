introduction globe specialty metals  inc  together with its subsidiaries collectively  gsm  we  or our is one of the leading manufacturers of silicon metal and silicon based alloys 
as of june   we owned and operated seven principal manufacturing facilities  in two primary operating segments gmi  our north american operations and  globe metales  our argentine operations 
business segments we operate in six reportable segments gmi a manufacturer of silicon metal and silicon based alloys located in north america with plants in beverly  ohio  alloy  west virginia  niagara falls  new york  selma  alabama  bridgeport  alabama and b cancour  quebec and a provider of specialty metallurgical coal for the silicon metal and silicon based alloys industries located in corbin  kentucky  globe metais a distributor of silicon metal manufactured in brazil 
this segment includes the historical brazilian manufacturing operations  comprised of a manufacturing plant in breu branco and mining operations and forest reserves  which were all sold on november  subsequent to this divestiture  globe metais net sales relate only to the fulfillment of certain retained customer contracts  which were completed as of december   globe metales a manufacturer of silicon based alloys located in argentina with a silicon based alloys plant in mendoza and a cored wire fabrication facility in san luis  solsil a developer and manufacturer of upgraded metallurgical grade silicon metal located in the united states with operations in beverly  ohio  corporate a corporate office including general expenses  investments  and related investment income  and other includes an electrode production operation in china yonvey and a cored wire production facility located in poland 
these operations do not fit into the above reportable segments  and are immaterial for purposes of separate disclosure 
overview and recent developments customer demand remains strong for silicon metal and silicon based alloys as our major end markets  which include chemicals  aluminum  automotive  steel and solar are showing improvement 
spot pricing for silicon metal and silicon based alloys remains good but declined modestly in the fiscal fourth quarter as european demand remains sluggish and competitors lowered prices 
the modest decline in silicon metal spot pricing served to reduce our average selling price due to the fact that approximately of our annual contracts are priced based on indices and adjust quarterly 
the modest decline in silicon based alloy pricing also affected our realized pricing as these products are priced on a quarterly basis 
we continue to operate at full capacity and our end markets have excellent prospects for continued improvement 
in our chemicals end market  which represents producers of silicones  the single largest application for silicon metal  the large manufacturers are performing well 
polysilicon production and solar cell demand is also continuing to grow  with new domestic production capacity coming on line  specifically two new plants being built in tennessee  despite decreased pricing and a reduction in subsidies 
steel capacity utilization and auto production  two significant end markets  are both expected to grow  and auto related aluminum production which uses the most silicon metal is also expected to increase 
we are presently running all of the furnaces at our six primary plants at full capacity  subject to normal maintenance outages 
we closed on the acquisition of the silicon metal assets of becancour silicon metal inc on june   including its interest in quebec silicon limited partnership  a  metric ton silicon metal plant as well as certain other working capital assets 
globe operates the silicon metal plant  consolidates the results  and purchases approximately of the finished goods output at a price approximately equal to the fully loaded cost of production and sells the material to third party customers 
dow corning corporation dow corning has the right to purchase the other of the plant s output at a price approximately equal to the fully loaded cost of production 
this arrangement is similar to the company s existing joint venture with dow corning at its alloy  west virginia plant 
globe believes that it can achieve meaningful cost reductions and operating efficiencies at the plant  primarily involving raw materials and should benefit globe and dow corning 
we have already made certain improvements and cost reductions at the plant by providing alden coal  reducing employee headcount and enhancing operating procedures 
earlier in may we closed on a new  syndicated credit facility 
the facility refinanced existing debt and closing costs of  and along with the company s cash balances  it can be used to finance acquisitions  growth initiatives  stock buy backs  working capital and for general corporate purposes 
the facility is a revolving loan and does not require a borrowing base 
it has a five year term and at the current leverage ratio  carries an interest rate of libor plus 
the loan has certain financial covenants  negative covenants and restrictions 
during our fiscal fourth quarter  we shipped approximately more material than in the immediately preceding quarter 
approximately half of this increase was related to the acquisition of quebec silicon in mid june and half to the timing of existing customer shipments 
net sales for the fourth quarter increased  or  from the preceding quarter as a result of the increase in tons shipped partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices 
the average selling price decreased in the quarter due to a modest decline in silicon metal and silicon based alloy spot pricing 
other sales also increased in the quarter by  primarily due to the sale  at cost  of certain raw materials that were no longer required in production 
during the fourth quarter we incurred  of transaction related and due diligence expenses  including  for the write off of the iceland prepaid expenses 
we had intended to build a silicon metal plant in iceland but have instead written off the costs due to the current economic conditions in europe and the lack of available financing 
we also wrote off  of deferred financing expenses related to the refinancing of our prior debt by our new holding company  revolving credit facility 
during the fourth quarter we lowered our per ton production costs by approximately  for a saving of approximately  which effectively offset the modestly lower average selling prices in the quarter 
income before provision for income taxes totaled  in the fourth quarter  which included the  of transaction expenses and  of deferred financing costs write off 
this compares to income before provision for income taxes in the third quarter of  which included  of transaction expenses 
outlook we continue to see improving demand for our products as our end markets expand and we continue to operate at full capacity  subject to scheduled maintenance outages and unplanned downtime 
as demand in europe remains sluggish  prices for our products have declined modestly 
however  in the fourth quarter we were able to successfully lower production costs which more than offset the effect of the lower pricing 
we expect our average selling price of silicon metal and silicon based alloys to remain relatively flat for the remainder of calendar our silicon metal average selling price is based on our annual fixed price contracts  our annual index based contracts which adjust each quarter based on spot pricing and our spot sales 
silicon based alloy pricing resets each quarter  and pricing is a function of overall supply and demand 
demand is largely derived from steel capacity utilization and auto production 
we expect an increase in tons sold in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the first full quarter of quebec silicon results 
this should result in an increase in sales with a modest increase in gross margin 
however  this increase in gross margin could be more than offset by an expected  shortfall caused by storm related power outages 
in mid june our bridgeport  alabama plant suffered an unplanned power outage related to storms and in early july our alloy  west virginia plant suffered two unplanned power outages related to storms 
although the storms were very severe the plants did not suffer significant direct damage 
however  the plants ceased operations for several days and then took a few weeks to resume full production 
this caused a shortfall in expected production as well as higher costs 
our alden coal business continues to meet expectations as it supplies the majority of the coal needs for our plants and is expanding sales to third parties 
we expect alden s volumes to continue to grow and its cost per ton of production to decline 
we continue to pursue the business interruption insurance claim for the bridgeport fire 
we expect the final claim to be paid by the second quarter of fiscal we are optimistic about our results for fiscal as we see shipments increasing  selling prices remaining stable and possibly increasing based on improving demand and cost of production declining 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates used under different assumptions or conditions 
business combinations we have completed a number of significant business acquisitions 
our business strategy contemplates that we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
when we acquire a business  the purchase price is allocated based on the fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired  and liabilities assumed 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the residual of the excess of the consideration transferred  plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
we generally engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and may impact reported depreciation and amortization in future periods  as well as any related impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets 
goodwill at june   we had goodwill totaling  we annually review  in the third quarter of our fiscal year  goodwill for impairment 
a review is also performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill of the reporting unit 
fair value is measured based on a discounted cash flow method  using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model  or a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings consistent with the objective of measuring fair value 
the estimates of cash flows  future earnings  and discount rate are subject to change due to the economic environment and business trends  including such factors as raw material and product pricing  interest rates  expected market returns and volatility of markets served  as well as our future manufacturing capabilities  government regulation and technological change 
we believe that the estimates of future cash flows  future earnings  and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates  circumstances or conditions could have a significant impact on our fair valuation determination  which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we performed the annual impairment testing 
as of that date  all reporting units had fair values that exceeded carrying values and no impairment charge was required 
in our year end assessment  our forecasts for the yonvey business unit included a reduction in production levels  testing of new raw materials and cost rationalization initiatives for the next fiscal year 
our yonvey business unit had a calculated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by less than an amount we deem substantial 
we are closely monitoring the operating plans of our yonvey unit 
if we do not meet our operating plans  we could incur a goodwill impairment charge of up to the carrying amount of  long lived assets at june   we had property  plant  and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  totaling  including  associated with our solsil business unit 
solsil is currently focused on research and development projects and is not producing material for commercial sale 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future undiscounted pretax cash flows of the related operations 
we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if these undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group  an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
assets to be disposed are written down to the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values  and third party independent appraisals  as considered necessary 
we believe that the estimates of future cash flows  future earnings  and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates  circumstances or conditions  including the results of solsil s research and development activities  could have a significant impact on our fair valuation determination  which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations 
inventories at june   we had inventories totaling  inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value  which does not exceed net realizable value 
cost of inventories is determined either by the first in  first out method or by the average cost method 
when circumstances indicate a potential valuation issue  tests are performed to assess net realizable value  and as necessary  an inventory write down is recorded for obsolete  slow moving or defective inventory 
we estimate market and net realizable value based on current and future selling prices for our inventories  as well as the expected utilization of parts and supplies in our manufacturing process 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  changes in estimates or future price decreases caused by changing economic conditions  including customer demand  could result in future inventory adjustments  resulting in decreased operating profits and lower asset levels 
share based compensation during the year ended june   we recorded share based compensation expense of  share based payments to the extent they are compensatory are recognized in our consolidated statement of income based on their fair values 
we have applied the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab in our accounting for share based compensation 
we are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce share based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
given our share based compensation was granted under a new plan and that there is limited historical data  we have estimated a forfeiture rate of zero 
actual forfeitures in the future may differ from this estimate  which would favorably impact our future results from operations 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global select market effective july  
accordingly  for stock awards granted subsequent to july   we value our common stock based upon the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market on the date immediately preceding the date of grant 
prior to july   our common stock was traded on the aim market of the london stock exchange  and we valued our common stock based upon the closing price of our common stock on the aim market on the date immediately preceding the date of grant 
the fair value of an award is affected by our closing stock price as well as other assumptions  including the estimated volatility over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  which is calculated using the simplified method allowed by sab as there is limited trading data related to our common stock  the expected volatility over the expected vesting term of our share based compensation is based upon the historical volatilities of similar companies 
the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the award 
our expected dividend rate for grants prior to june  was zero as we did not pay cash dividends on our common stock and did not anticipate doing so 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which would impact our results from operations 
income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of  during the year ended june  as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recognized to reduce deferred tax assets if  and to the extent that  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the need for a valuation allowance is based on an on going evaluation of current information including  among other things  estimates of future earnings in different tax jurisdictions and the expected timing of deferred income tax asset and liability reversals 
we believe that the determination to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is based  in part  on an estimate of future taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we do business  which is susceptible to change and may or may not occur  as well as the estimated timing of the reversal of temporary differences  which give rise to our deferred income tax assets  and because the impact of adjusting a valuation allowance may be material 
in the event that actual results differ from estimates in future periods  and depending on the tax strategies that we may be able to implement  changes to the valuation allowance could impact our financial position and results of operations 
as part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is generally not tax deductible  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expense as a part of the purchase price allocation process 
we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities 
income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any adjustments are recorded as adjustments to income tax expense 
prior to our adoption of accounting standards codification subtopic  business combinations  on july   such adjustments were recorded to a reduce to zero any goodwill related to the acquisition  b reduce to zero other noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition  and c reduce income tax expense 
we recognize an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  based on the technical merits of the position 
the income tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority 
the determination of an uncertain tax position and the likelihood of it being realized requires critical judgment and estimates 
we carefully assess each of the uncertain tax positions in order to determine the tax benefit that can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
we record and or disclose such potential tax liabilities  as appropriate  and reasonably estimate our income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets 
if new information becomes available  adjustments will be charged against income at that time 
we do not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity  however  it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on our reported results of operations 
results of operations our results of operations are affected by our recent acquisitions of alden resources on july  and quebec silicon on june  accordingly  our results for the year ended june  include approximately eleven months of results from alden resources and seventeen days of results from quebec silicon 
additionally  we sold the manufacturing operations of globe metais in november  but continued to sell a portion of the silicon metal produced by globe metais to fulfill commitments to customers of globe metais that we retained until december  gsm fiscal year ended june  vs

the increase in average selling prices resulted in an increase in net sales of  with a and increase in selling prices of silicon metal and silicon based alloys  respectively 
the increase in silicon metal pricing was primarily driven by higher pricing of calendar contracts as compared to calendar contracts  as well as improved spot pricing in fiscal year the increase in silicon based alloys pricing was primarily due to an increase in magnesium ferrosilicon pricing  resulting from strong demand from the automotive industry  and a pass through of higher rare earth costs 
ferrosilicon pricing improved as demand improved from the steel industry and the sale of higher purity and specialty grades of ferrosilicon 
metric tons sold remained flat year over year 
there was a decrease in silicon metal tons sold offset by a increase in silicon based alloys tons sold 
the decline in silicon metal tons was primarily due to the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  subsequent to this divestiture  remaining globe metais sales related only to the fulfillment of certain retained customer contracts completed at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year  and no further sales will be made under this arrangement 
the silicon volume decrease was partially offset by the acquisition of quebec silicon on june  which contributed  tons during fiscal year silicon based alloys tons sold increased primarily due to demand from the automotive and steel industries 
other revenue increased by  primarily due to third party coal sales from the acquisition of alden and the sale of manganese ore  which was purchased as a raw material and ultimately not used in production 
cost of goods sold the  or increase in cost of goods sold was a result of a increase in our cost per ton sold and the increase in by product and other sales 
the increase in cost per ton sold reflects the impact of the planned maintenance performed on six of our fourteen domestic furnaces  the costs associated with the fire at our bridgeport  alabama ferrosilicon facility  and the impact of higher raw material and production costs year over year 
gross margin represented approximately of net sales in fiscal year and decreased from of net sales in fiscal year the decrease was mainly attributable to higher production costs related to the planned maintenance outages  the fire at our bridgeport  alabama facility and the recognition of  in previously deferred revenue in the prior year period 
this was offset by an increase in average selling prices year over year 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or was primarily due to an increase in bonus expense of  due to higher profitability year over year  higher due diligence and transaction related expenses of  and the impact of acquisitions which increased expense by  and  for alden and quebec silicon  respectively

other income other income increased by  primarily due to foreign exchange gains resulting from the revaluation of long term reais denominated liabilities  partially offset by foreign exchange losses due to currency fluctuations associated with the polish zloty  chinese renminbi  and euro 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was approximately or  in fiscal year and was approximately in fiscal year the decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to reduced state taxes and reduced foreign losses which are not deductible for tax purposes

the increase in volume includes the impact of the core metals acquisition  which contributed approximately  incremental metric tons in fiscal year versus fiscal year additionally  end market demand for ferrosilicon and magnesium ferrosilicon increased in fiscal year due to the economic recovery  particularly in steel and automotive production 
the increase in average selling price of resulted in increased net sales of approximately  the increase in pricing was primarily due to higher pricing of the annual calendar contracts and higher spot pricing 
the increase in pricing was also due to improved demand from the economic recovery  offset by the impact of the acquisition of core metals in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which resulted in a mix shift towards the production of ferrosilicon 
ferrosilicon is our lowest priced alloy and also has the lowest cost of production

as a result of the acquisition of core metals in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  there was a product mix shift towards ferrosilicon  which is our lowest priced alloy and also has the lowest cost of production 
this impact was offset by higher pricing on ferrosilicon and magnesium ferrosilicon products due to increased market demand 
the gmi segment includes the alloy joint venture  which was entered into on november   and sells of the output of the alloy plant to dow corning corporation dow corning at cost 
we control the joint venture and consolidate its results in our financial statements 
as a result of the joint venture  gmi s gross margin has been negatively impacted by virtue of the material sold to dow corning at cost 
the increase in pricing for silicon metal during fiscal year more than offset this impact and resulted in increased gross margin year over year 
operating income increased by  from the prior year to  this increase was primarily due to higher volumes shipped of silicon based alloys and silicon metal and higher average selling prices for silicon metal

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents balance  cash flows from operations  and unused commitments under our existing credit facilities

the terms of certain of our financing arrangements place restrictions on distributions of funds to us  however  we do not expect this to have an impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations 
we believe we have access to adequate resources to meet our needs for normal operating costs  capital expenditure  and working capital for our existing business 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry as well as financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control

accounting pronouncements to be implemented in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
the objective of this amendment is to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
the amendments require entities to report components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
additionally  the amendments in asu require an entity to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 which deferred the specific requirements related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
this amendment is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we expect the adoption of this asu will affect financial statement presentation only 
in september  fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 testing goodwill for impairment asu  which amends the guidance in asc the amendments in asu provide entities with the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the first step of the two step impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test would be unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
asu also provides entities with the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the first step of the two step impairment test 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  but early adoption is permitted 
the company does not expect material financial statement implications relating to the adoption of this asu 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  and foreign exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  including obtaining captive or long term contracted raw material supplies and hedging strategies 
obtaining captive or long term contracted raw material supplies involves the acquisition of companies or assets for the purpose of increasing our access to raw materials or the identification and effective implementation of long term leasing rights or supply agreements 
we enter into derivative instruments to hedge certain commodity price  interest rate  and foreign currency risks 
we do not engage in commodity  interest rate  or currency speculation  and no derivatives are held for trading purposes 
all derivatives are accounted for using mark to market accounting 
we believe it is not practical to designate our derivative instruments as hedging instruments as defined under asc subtopic  derivatives and hedging asc 
accordingly  we adjust our derivative financial instruments to current market value through the consolidated statement of income based on the fair value of the agreement as of period end 
although not designated as hedged items as defined under asc  these derivative instruments serve to significantly offset our commodity  interest rate  and currency risks 
gains or losses from these transactions offset gains or losses on the assets  liabilities  or transactions being hedged 
no credit loss is anticipated as the counterparties to our derivative agreements are major financial institutions that are highly rated 
the sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below 
see our june  consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies 
commodity prices we are exposed to price risk for certain raw materials and energy used in our production process 
the raw materials and energy which we use are largely commodities  subject to price volatility caused by changes in global supply and demand and governmental controls 
derivative financial instruments are not used extensively to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the cost of commodity products used in our operations 
we attempt to reduce the impact of increases in our raw material and energy costs by negotiating long term contracts and through the acquisition of companies or assets for the purpose of increasing our access to raw materials with favorable pricing terms 
we have entered into long term power supply contracts that result in stable  favorably priced long term commitments for the majority of our power needs 
additionally  we have long term lease mining rights in the us that supply us with a substantial portion of our requirements for quartzite 
we also have obtained a captive supply of electrodes through our ownership interest in yonvey 
in june  we entered into a power hedge agreement on a  mwh notional amount of electricity  representing approximately of the total power required by our niagara falls  new york plant 
this hedge covers our expected needs not supplied by the facility s long term power contract over the term of the hedge agreement 
the notional amount decreases equally per month through the agreement s expiration on june  under the power hedge agreement  we fixed the power rate at per mwh over the life of the contract 
in october  we entered into a power hedge agreement on a  mwh notional amount of electricity 
the agreement is effective july  and the notional amount decreases equally per month through the agreement s expiration on june  under the power hedge agreement  we fixed the power rate at per mwh over the life of the contract 
the  liability associated with the fair value of our power hedge agreements at june  is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
to the extent that we have not mitigated our exposure to rising raw material and energy prices  we may not be able to increase our prices to our customers to offset such potential raw material or energy price increases  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and operating cash flows 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on certain of our short term and long term debt obligations 
the company had outstanding total debt at june  of  with interest rates arranging from to 
the company previously entered into interest rate cap arrangement and swap agreements to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations on its recently terminated senior credit facility and long term debt 
the company settled these agreements in connection with the termination of the senior credit facility and long term debt 
the company would consider entering into hedge agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk  if conditions warrant 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the full fiscal year as compared to the rates in effect at june   we estimate that the change would not have a material impact to our cash flows or results of operations 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of operations outside the united states  principally in argentina and china 
a portion of our net sales generated from our non us operations is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of our operating costs for our us operations are denominated in local currencies  principally the argentine peso and the chinese renminbi 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of our non us dollar sales  and related accounts receivable balances  and our operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
derivative instruments are not used extensively to manage this risk 
we have utilized derivative financial instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts  to manage a portion of our net foreign currency exposure to the brazilian real and the euro 
all of the brazilian real contracts were settled prior to the sale of the manufacturing operations of globe metais 
if foreign exchange rates were to increase or decrease by for the full fiscal year  as compared to the rates in effect at june   we estimate that the change would not have a material impact to our cash flows or results of operations
