as used in this md a  the terms we  us  our and the company mean scientific games corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries 
business overview general we are a leading global supplier of products and services to lotteries and a leading provider of gaming technology and content to gaming operators worldwide 
we also gain access to technology and pursue global expansion through strategic acquisitions and equity investments 
we manage and report our operations in three business segments printed products  lottery systems  and gaming 
corporate expenses are not allocated to segments 
see business segment results below and note business and geographic segments for additional business segment information 
the discussion below highlights certain key drivers of our business and certain known trends  demands  commitments  events and uncertainties that have affected our recent financial and operating performance and may affect our future financial and operating performance 
our revenue is classified as instant ticket revenue  service revenue and sales revenue 
instant ticket revenue includes revenue related to our instant ticket fulfillment and services businesses  including our brand licensing and properties plus businesses 
revenue generated from our sales of lottery systems  terminals  gaming machines  gaming content and phone cards  which sales are typically non recurring in nature and not subject to multi year supply agreements  is categorized as sales revenue 
all other revenue generated from lottery systems including revenue from the validation of instant tickets and gaming is classified as service revenue 
we believe we are likely to continue to experience a highly competitive procurement environment for domestic and international customer contracts in connection with bids  re bids  extensions and renewals  which could lead to the loss of contracts or rate reductions and or additional service requirements in contracts that we win or retain 
in  a number of our customer contracts are up for re bid  extension or renewal 
see the table in business contract procurement in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our customer contracts 
our strategy to counter balance these industry trends includes working with our customers to grow their sales through a variety of methods including launching new products and services  implementing innovative technologies and marketing tools and expanding retail distribution 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenue from sales to customers outside of the us and were affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the foreign currencies to which we are most exposed are the british pound sterling and euro 
we refer herein to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which results from translating foreign functional currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes 
the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations represents the difference between the relevant period rates and the prior period rates applied to the relevant period activity 
printed products retail sales of instant tickets can be a key performance indicator of our instant ticket revenue  although there may not always be a direct correlation between retail sales and our instant ticket revenue due to the type of contract eg  ppk versus pos or csp contracts  the impact of changes in our customer contracts or other factors 
based on third party data  our customers total instant ticket lottery retail sales in the us increased approximately in compared to most of our us customers reported year over year growth in sales of instant tickets  which we believe was primarily driven by sales of higher price point tickets 
our us instant ticket revenue increased approximately in compared to due in part to the improvement in retail sales 
internationally  we also experienced instant ticket revenue growth in from our pos and csp contracts  which we believe was also attributable to sales of higher price point tickets 
our licensed game contracts are generally game specific and therefore short term and non recurring 
our instant ticket revenue may be negatively impacted to the extent we are unable to continue to win licensed game specific or multi state game contracts 
there has been an increase in interest within the lottery industry in player loyalty programs  which we believe may result in growth opportunities for our properties plus offering 
in the third quarter of  the iowa lottery launched properties plus and the tennessee lottery awarded us a contract for a player loyalty system 
in addition  the missouri lottery is expected to begin a properties plus program in the first quarter of we expect our results of operations to be positively impacted by these new opportunities 
we are the primary supplier of instant lottery tickets for lns  which was awarded the concession to be the exclusive operator of the italian gratta e vinci instant ticket lottery beginning on october  lns succeeded consorzio lotterie nazionali cln  a consortium comprised of essentially the same group that owns lns  which held the prior concession 
over the life of the new concession  we expect that we will supply no less than of lns instant ticket production requirements 
retail sales of the italian instant ticket lottery increased in compared to our results reflect a year over year increase in instant ticket revenue related to our ppk contract with lns  which we believe resulted from lns increased focus on business operations following the completion of the tender process for the new concession  increased retail distribution and the success of a ticket 
however  retail sales for the fourth quarter of were flat compared to the prior year period  and preliminary retail sales information through mid february indicates a decline in retail sales of approximately compared to the prior year period  despite retail sales growth of approximately in january while we believe february sales may have been negatively impacted to some extent by severe inclement weather in certain parts of italy  the recent sales information illustrates the volatility of instant ticket retail sales in italy 
the upfront fees paid by lns in associated with the new concession are amortized by lns anticipated to be approximately million per year of the new concession  which reduces our earnings from equity investments 
our share of the amortization is approximately million per year on a pre tax basis 
in light of the corporate structure of lns  we record earnings from our equity investment in lns on an after tax basis  which impacted the comparability of our results of operations from our equity investment during since we recorded earnings from cln on a pre tax basis 
under our csp agreement with northstar  we are responsible for the design  development  manufacturing  warehousing and distribution of instant lottery tickets and are compensated based on a percentage of retail sales 
our increase in instant ticket revenue in reflected the commencement of our csp agreement with northstar on july  northstar is entitled to receive annual incentive compensation payments from illinois to the extent it is successful in increasing the lottery s net income above specified target levels  subject to a cap of of the applicable year s net income 
northstar will be responsible for payments to illinois to the extent such targets are not achieved  subject to a similar cap 
the lottery net income levels set forth in northstar s successful bid for the private management agreement  or pma  were million  million  million  million and billion for the five fiscal years ending june     and  respectively  representing a compound annual growth rate in lottery net income of approximately  including an approximate increase in lottery net income in the first year 
these net income target levels are subject to upward or downward adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the pma 
northstar is entitled to be reimbursed on a monthly basis for most of its operating expenses under the pma  although certain expenses of northstar associated with managing the lottery are not reimbursable 
earnings and cash flows from our equity investment in northstar may be impacted to the extent the lottery achieves  or fails to achieve  the applicable net income targets and will be impacted to the extent northstar incurs non reimbursable expenses 
the impact of this equity method investment was not material to our earnings from our equity investments in as us states and international jurisdictions increasingly look towards lottery and gaming as a source to grow revenue  we believe they could pursue an outsourcing model whereby the day to day management of their lotteries are conducted by a third party  similar to the private management agreement the illinois lottery awarded to our northstar 
we believe that instant lottery tickets currently comprise less than of lottery sales outside of the us  compared to almost in the us we are especially focused on increasing instant ticket penetration in both underpenetrated and new jurisdictions  particularly in asia  south latin america and eastern central europe 
in greece  we recently submitted an expression of interest to operate a new instant ticket lottery through a consortium comprised of us and three other lottery and gaming companies 
lottery systems based on third party data  our lottery systems customers total draw game retail sales in the us increased approximately in compared to in  our service revenue in the us was flat  reflecting this improvement in retail sales offset by lost contracts in new hampshire and vermont as of june  the level of jackpots of the powerball and mega millions multi state draw lottery games impact our service revenues 
in  us lottery directors authorized certain changes to the powerball game  including an increase in the ticket price to  which became effective on january  the increase in the powerball ticket price potentially provides an impetus for sales growth in draw lottery retail sales 
our service revenue is also impacted by increases or decreases in retail sales of instant tickets where we provide the instant ticket validation services as part of a lottery systems contract 
we are the exclusive instant ticket validation network provider to the csl 
instant ticket retail sales of the csl increased approximately in compared to we believe the increase is a result of our strategic initiatives related to our china operations  which focus on accelerating growth through the offering of higher price point instant tickets  such as the launch of a rmb ticket in the third quarter of  the expansion of the retailer and validation network  the introduction of tickets with licensed brands such as the nba and advertising campaigns to build brand awareness 
we also continue to focus on the pursuit of additional distribution channels 
the rate we receive on retail sales under our china instant ticket validation contract decreased by in january  decreased by an additional in january and is scheduled to decrease an additional in january to the extent we are not able to continue to offset these rate reductions by retail sales growth  our revenue and gross margin from this contract may be adversely affected 
our lottery system sales revenue is non recurring and generated primarily outside the us we have recently seen an increase in bidding opportunities to provide central monitoring and control systems for video gaming networks  particularly in jurisdictions in north america  as these jurisdictions pursue vlts as an opportunity to address budget deficits 
we believe that this could be an attractive growth opportunity for the company in the coming years 
on january   we signed a contract to design  implement and administer our sixth generation aegis video central communication system ccs for the illinois gaming board 
under the terms of the contract  we will provide real time communication and control between every licensed video gaming terminal in the state of illinois  as well as day to day management of the operation of the ccs and service throughout the state 
the contract was awarded through a competitive procurement process  has an initial term of six years and may be extended by mutual agreement up to four additional years 
beginning in  we expect that our results of operations will be impacted as a result of this contract 
gaming our gaming segment included the racing business prior to its sale to sportech on october  due to the company s continued involvement with sportech  including our equity interest in sportech  the disposal of the racing business did not qualify as discontinued operations and was not reflected as such in our consolidated statements of operations 
the comparability of our results of operations during was affected by the sale of the racing business 
the lbo sector of the uk gaming industry is highly competitive and concentrated to approximately four large lbo operators in the uk in  global draw began migrating its server based gaming machines to a new back end technology platform and rolling out this new technology to its uk customers 
global draw completed the uk migration in the second quarter of net win per machine increased in compared to  which we believe was attributable in part to the new technology platform 
we began migrating server based gaming machines located outside the uk to the new technology platform during the third quarter of in  we completed the installation of gaming machines for the entire ladbrokes lbo estate in accordance with the four year contract that was awarded to us in the roll out of gaming machines for ladbrokes represented a significant portion of the increase in our installed gaming machine base from  at december  to  at december  our operating results reflect an increase in revenue resulting from our higher installed base of gaming machines 
in january  william hill plc  a uk bookmaker  awarded a contract to one of our principal competitors currently the supplier for a majority of gaming machines for william hill for the sole supply of gaming machines to william hill s lbos following the expiration of our gaming machine supply contract with william hill in march the loss of this contract will impact our operating results in on september   we completed the acquisition of barcrest  a leading supplier of games  gaming content  gaming platforms and systems to gaming operators and venues in the uk and in continental europe 
barcrest is being integrated with our existing gaming business 
the comparability of our results of operations was  and the comparability of our results of operations will be  affected by the acquisition 
in january  following a comprehensive strategic review  we announced our exit from the barcrest analog awp machine business in order to focus our game design and other resources solely on a digital server based model 
we also reorganized the games media digital supply business to more effectively capitalize on the barcrest acquisition 
in  we recorded approximately million of employee termination and restructuring costs associated with the integration of barcrest 
we expect that our operating results may be impacted in the first half of by increased employee termination and restructuring costs of approximately million to million resulting from our exit from the analog barcrest awp business and the reorganization of games media 
in late  the uk government announced its intention to change the taxation of gaming machines by introducing a new a new machine games duty  or mgd  that would replace both the currently applicable amusement machine license duty and value added tax 
a consultation process between the government and industry representatives regarding the announced tax changes is ongoing 
the rates of mgd will be determined as part of the normal budget process 
the tax changes are expected to be implemented in february although we cannot predict the precise effect of these tax changes on our uk gaming machine business  which will depend in large part on the rates of the mgd  these tax changes could potentially have an overall negative impact on this business 
we continue to seek to expand our wide area gaming deployments of server based gaming machines and systems outside the uk into jurisdictions including the caribbean  mexico  lithuania  puerto rico  and poland 
in addition  the acquisition of barcrest provided us with entry into the czech and italy wide area gaming sectors 
as of december   we had approximately  gaming machines deployed outside the uk recently issued accounting guidance in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards codification asc as summarized in accounting standards update asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
as summarized in asu  asc topic has been amended to remove from the scope of industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
as summarized in asu  asc topic has been amended to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated  to require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling price  and to eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
the accounting changes summarized in asu and asu are both effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application 
we adopted these amendments to the asc on january  on a prospective basis as applicable to our revenue generated from licensing branded properties that are coupled with a service component  where we also purchase and distribute prizes on behalf of lottery authorities 
the impact of these accounting changes was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements 
the new guidance limits the highest and best use measure to nonfinancial assets  permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis  and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts 
additionally  the new guidance expands the disclosures on level inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions  as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs 
we adopted the new guidance on january  in june  the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
instead  an entity will be required to present net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance was adopted on january  and will impact our financial statement presentation of comprehensive income for the period ending march  and the prior year period that will be reflected in our form q that we will file for the period ending march  the new guidance also requires presentation of reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 
however  the effective date pertaining to this requirement was deferred by the update issued by fasb in december in september  the fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that this is the case  it is required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any 
if an entity determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test is required 
we will apply the new guidance to our december  annual goodwill impairment valuation

critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
as described below  the determination of when to recognize revenue for certain revenue transactions requires judgment 
revenue from licensed branded property coupled with a service component whereby we purchase and distribute merchandise prizes on behalf of the lottery authorities to identified winners is recognized pursuant to asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
under asu  two deliverables in this arrangement  the license and the merchandising services  become separate units of accounting 
we then allocate revenue to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
revenue allocated to the license is recognized when the use of the licensed brand is permitted  typically when the contract is signed 
revenue allocated to the merchandising services is recognized on a proportional performance method as this method best reflects the pattern in which the obligations of the merchandising services to the customer are fulfilled 
a performance measure is used based on total estimated cost allocated to the merchandising services 
by accumulating costs for services as they are incurred  and dividing such costs by the total costs of merchandising services which is estimated based on a budget prior to contract inception  a percentage is determined 
the percentage determined is applied to the revenue allocated to the merchandising services and that proportionate amount of revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
revenue from the sale of lottery systems that require the production and delivery of terminals and customized software is recognized using the cost to cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of our products 
estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
revenues under percentage of completion contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options are determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the estimation of stock based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and  to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 
we may grant certain stock based awards that are contingent upon the company achieving certain financial performance targets 
upon determining the performance target is probable  the fair value of the award is recognized over the service period  subject to potential adjustment 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the company has three reporting units printed products  lottery systems  and gaming 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse change in the legality of our business ventures or the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant customer 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value using a two step impairment test 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow or by a comparison to third party indications of fair market value 
the estimate of a reporting unit s fair value requires the use of assumptions and estimates regarding the reporting unit s future cash flows  growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
given the significance of goodwill  an adverse change to the estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements 
our annual impairment valuation as of december  produced estimated fair values of equity for our reporting units in excess of the carrying value of equity 
in each case  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value 
accordingly  we do not believe that any of our reporting units were at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test as of december  significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and products  it is possible that forecasts used to support our goodwill may change in the future  which could result in significant non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
income taxes and deferred income taxes income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
the company s tax expense includes the us and international income taxes but excludes the provision for us taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries deemed to be permanently invested 
the company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the company recognizes in the financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year 
the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
the company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely 
at december   the company has a valuation allowance of million recorded against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and in the normal course of business is examined in various jurisdictions 
the reversal of the accruals is recorded when examinations are completed  statutes of limitation are closed or tax laws are changed 
liquidity  capital sources and working capital sources of liquidity at december   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facility discussed below under credit agreement and other debt 
at december   our available cash and equivalents and borrowing capacity totaled million including cash and cash equivalents of million and availability of million under the revolving credit facility compared to million at december  including cash and cash equivalents of million and availability of million under our million revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding  however  we had million in outstanding letters of credit as of december   which reduces our available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the amount of our available cash and equivalents fluctuates principally based on borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities  investments  acquisitions and changes in our working capital position 
our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will depend on outstanding borrowings and letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility and will depend on us remaining in compliance with the limitations imposed by our credit agreement  including the maintenance of our financial ratios and other covenants 
we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit agreement as of december  we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
we believe that substantially all cash held outside the us is free from legal encumbrances or similar restrictions that would prevent it from being available to meet the company s global liquidity needs 
the company s intention is to reinvest undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries to fund operations in the us total cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was million as of december  to the extent that a portion of our foreign cash were required to meet liquidity needs in the us which we do not currently anticipate  we might incur a tax liability  the timing and amount of which would depend on a variety of factors 
a significant amount of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december  could be transferred to the us as repayments of intercompany loans and we have significant foreign tax credit carryovers that would be available to reduce any potential us tax liability 
our contracts are periodically subject to renewal and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in sustaining our cash flow from operations should our existing contracts not be renewed  be renewed on less favorable terms  or through the addition of new contracts 
in addition  lottery customers in the united states generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with each state contract 
as of december   our aggregate outstanding performance bonds were million 
our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to the company s financial condition and by prevailing market conditions  which may be impacted by economic and political events 
although we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining such bonds to date  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  or provide letters of credit or cash in lieu of performance bonds  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness  on commercially reasonable terms or at all

credit agreement and other debt credit agreement we are party to a credit agreement  dated as of june   as amended and restated as of february   and amended as of december   march  and as further amended and restated as of august  as so amended  the credit agreement  among sgi  as borrower  the company  as a guarantor  the several lenders from time to time parties thereto and jpmorgan chase bank  na jpmorgan  as administrative agent 
a summary of the terms of the credit agreement and the financial ratios that the company is required to maintain under the terms of the credit agreement is included in note long term and other debt 
on march   the company and sgi entered into an amendment to the credit agreement the march amendment 
under the march amendment  from and after december   consolidated ebitda as such term is defined in the credit agreement will generally include the company s share of the earnings from our equity investment in lns  whether or not such earnings have been distributed to the company  before interest expense other than interest expense in respect of debt of lns if such debt exceeds million  income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense  provided that the amount of consolidated ebitda attributable to the company s interest in lns that would not have otherwise been permitted to be included in consolidated ebitda prior to giving effect to the march amendment will be capped at million in any period of four consecutive quarters or million in the case of any such period ending on or prior to june  
prior to giving effect to the march amendment  consolidated ebitda generally included only the company s share of the earnings of lns that was distributed to the company 
in addition  under the terms of the march amendment  any cash compensation expense incurred but not paid in a particular period will be added back for purposes of determining consolidated ebitda so long as no cash payment in respect thereof is required prior to the scheduled maturity of the borrowings under the credit agreement 
this add back was revised pursuant to the subsequent amendment described below to permit up to  of non cash compensation expense accrued prior to august  to be added back notwithstanding that cash payments may be required to be made in respect thereof prior to the scheduled maturity of the borrowings under the credit agreement 
consolidated ebitda is relevant for determining whether the company is in compliance with the financial ratios required to be maintained under the terms of the credit agreement 
the march amendment also provides that up to million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the company and its subsidiaries in excess of million will be netted against consolidated total debt for purposes of determining the company s consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated senior debt ratio as such terms are defined in the credit agreement as of any date from and after december  in connection with the march amendment  sgi paid approximately million of fees and expenses to or for the benefit of the consenting lenders 
for more information regarding the march amendment  see our current report on form k filed with the sec on march  on august   the company and sgi entered into an amendment to the credit agreement the august amendment 
in connection with the august amendment  the scheduled maturity date of approximately million or of the revolving credit facility commitments and approximately million or of the outstanding term loans under the credit agreement was extended from june  to june  under the amended credit agreement  sgi has the flexibility to extend the maturity date of  or reduce or prepay without premium or penalty other than break funding costs  the approximately million of revolving credit facility commitments and outstanding term loans that were not extended in connection with the august amendment  subject to certain conditions set forth in the august amendment or the credit agreement  as applicable 
on february   the company and sgi entered into an agreement to refinance the approximately million of revolving credit facility and term loan commitments that were not extended in connection with the august amendment and extend the maturity dates on these commitments to june  sgi paid approximately million of fees and expenses to or for the benefit of the new lender 
under the terms of the august amendment  certain financial covenant ratios were revised 
in addition  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at sgi s option  either a base rate determined by reference to the higher of a the prime rate of jpmorgan  b the federal funds effective rate plus and c the libor rate for a deposit in dollars with a maturity of one month plus  or a reserve adjusted libor rate  in each case plus an applicable margin based on the consolidated leverage ratio as set forth in a grid 
under the terms of the august amendment  the two lowest applicable margin levels in the grid were eliminated such that the applicable margin now varies based on the consolidated leverage ratio from to above the base rate for base rate loans  and from to above libor for libor based loans the august amendment provides for additional refinancing flexibility in the form of permitted bank debt or debt securities that may be unsecured or secured on a pari passu or junior basis with the collateral securing the obligations under the credit agreement and replacement facilities under the credit agreement that can be used to refinance either the term loans or the revolving commitments under the credit agreement in whole 
in addition  sgi will have the capability to request one or more additional tranches of term loans  increase the existing tranche of term loans  or increase the revolving commitments in an amount not to exceed million after the effective date of the amendment the incremental facility 
in lieu of incurring additional indebtedness pursuant to the incremental facility  the august amendment also provides sgi with the flexibility to incur additional incremental indebtedness in the form of one or more series of debt securities in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the amounts allowed to be incurred under the incremental facility 
in addition  the august amendment renews most of the negative covenant baskets as of the effective date of such amendment and provides investment flexibility for sgi by allowing the borrower to move capital stock  property and cash from non guarantor subsidiaries to loan parties and then back to non guarantor subsidiaries  subject to certain limitations set forth in the credit agreement 
the august amendment also provides sgi the ability to use an existing restricted payment basket comprised of million plus a permitted expenditure amount that is based in part on the cumulative consolidated net income of the company for investments and prepayments of certain indebtedness 
in connection with the august amendment  sgi paid an aggregate of approximately million of fees and expenses to or for the benefit of the consenting and new lenders of which approximately million was capitalized as deferred financing fees 
the company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
for more information regarding the august amendment  see our current report on form k filed with the sec on august  other debt on october   sgi completed a consent solicitation commenced on october  in which sgi sought and obtained consents from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of sgi s senior subordinated notes due the notes to certain amendments to the indenture governing the notes the indenture 
sgi paid consenting holders million in the aggregate in connection with the consent solicitation 
sgi and the other parties to the indenture entered into a supplemental indenture the supplemental indenture implementing the amendments to the indenture 
the supplemental indenture amends the indenture to conform certain provisions of the indenture to those contained in the indenture governing the company s notes and thereby provides the company with additional flexibility for investment opportunities that it may decide to pursue  including potential strategic partnerships  equity investments and other acquisitions 
in particular  the supplemental indenture amends the definition of consolidated net income in the indenture to exclude certain items  including net after tax impairment charges and asset write offs  which will  among other things  increase the company s capacity to make additional restricted investments under the indenture 
in addition  the supplemental indenture amends the definition of permitted investments to include certain investments relating to the italian instant ticket concession held by lns 
the primary effect of this amendment is to grandfather the investments the company made in to cover the company s portion of the upfront fees associated with the new concession for purposes of determining the company s capacity to make additional restricted investments under the indenture 
for more information regarding the consent solicitation and the supplemental indenture  see our current report on form k filed with the sec on october  on may   we paid the remaining million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the promissory notes we issued to defer a portion of the earn out payable in connection with our acquisition of global draw in on january  we repaid rmb million of rmb million in aggregate principal amount of chinese bank loans with cash on hand

the objective of the hedge was to eliminate the variability of cash flows attributable to the libor component of interest expense paid on million of our variable rate debt 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness  contractual purchase obligations and future minimum operating lease obligations and other long term liabilities as set forth in the table below as of december  cash payments due by period in thousands total within year within years within years after years long term debt  notes long term debt  notes long term debt  notes long term debt  term loan unsecured borrowings denominated in rmb capital leases other long term debt interest expense contractual purchase obligations and capital requirements operating leases other liabilities total contractual obligations see note long term and other debt to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding long term and other debt 
based on rates in effect at december  includes  among other obligations  estimated obligations and or capital commitments in connection with our lottery contracts 
see note leases to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating leases 
we have excluded approximately million of long term pension plan and other post retirement liabilities  deferred compensation liabilities of approximately million  and the liability for uncertain tax positions of million at december  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
periodically  we bid on new online lottery contracts 
once awarded  these contracts generally require significant upfront capital expenditures for terminal assembly  customization of software  software and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration 
historically  we have funded these upfront costs through cash flows generated from operations  available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to continue to commit to new contracts will depend on  among other things  our then present liquidity levels and or our ability to borrow at commercially acceptable rates to finance the initial upfront costs 
the actual level of capital expenditures will ultimately largely depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
periodically  we elect to upgrade the technological capabilities of older terminals and replace terminals that have exhausted their useful lives 
servicing our installed terminal base requires that we maintain a supply of parts and accessories on hand 
we are also required  contractually in some cases  to provide spare parts over an extended period of time  principally in connection with our systems and terminal sale transactions 
to meet our contractual obligations and maintain sufficient levels of on hand inventory to service our installed base  we purchase inventory on an as needed basis 
we presently have no inventory purchase obligations  other than in the ordinary course of business 
under the terms of its private management agreement with the state of illinois the pma  northstar is entitled to receive annual incentive compensation payments to the extent it is successful in increasing the illinois lottery s net income above specified target levels  subject to a cap of of the applicable year s net income 
northstar will be responsible for payments to the state to the extent such targets are not achieved  subject to a similar cap 
we may be required to make capital contributions to northstar to fund our pro rata share ie  based on our percentage interest in northstar of any shortfall payments that may be owed by northstar to the state under the pma 
northstar is expected to be reimbursed on a monthly basis for most of its operating expenses under the pma 
in december  the company adopted the asia pacific plan 
the purpose of the asia pacific plan is to provide an equitable and competitive compensation opportunity to certain key employees and consultants of the company who are involved in the company s business in china and potentially other jurisdictions in the asia pacific region the asia pacific business and to promote the creation of long term value for the company s stockholders by directly linking asia pacific plan participants compensation under the plan to the appreciation in value of such business 
each participant will be eligible to receive a cash payment following the end of equal to a pre determined share of an asia pacific business incentive compensation pool 
the incentive compensation pool will equal a certain percentage of the growth in the value of the asia pacific business over four years  calculated in the manner provided under the asia pacific plan and subject to a cap of million  in the event an asia pacific business liquidity event does not occur by december  or million  in the event an asia pacific business liquidity event occurs by december  an asia pacific business liquidity event means an initial public offering of at least of the asia pacific business or a strategic investment by a third party to acquire at least of the asia pacific business  in each case  that is approved by the company 
as of december   we have recorded an accrual of million related to the asia pacific plan which is included in the contractual obligations table above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k for a more complete description of these risks and uncertainties 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes from any single event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits where appropriate  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal year  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
although we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and debt and equity market risks as we seek debt and equity capital to sustain our operations 
all of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading purposes 
at december   approximately of our debt was in fixed rate instruments 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity  capital resources and working capital in item of this annual report on form k for additional information about our financial instruments 
principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate december  dollars in thousands twelve months ended december thereafter total fmv debt at fixed interest rates weighted average interest rates debt at variable interest rates weighted average interest rates we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in australia  austria  chile  china  germany  ireland  italy  mexico  canada  china  spain  sweden and the united kingdom 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our international operations is incurred in the local currencies 
although we provide technology based products  systems and services to gaming industries worldwide  some of our transactions and their resulting financial impact are transacted in us dollars 
the foreign currencies to which we have the most exposure are the euro and the british pound sterling  representing approximately and of our non u 
s dollar revenues in historically  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has been more significant with respect to revenues than expenses  as a significant portion of our expenses  such as paper and ink  are contracted for in us dollars 
at december   a hypothetical strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound sterling would result in a decrease in revenue of approximately million and million  respectively  and a decrease in operating income of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies from our equity investments denominated in euro and british pound sterling 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by one or more of the following i securing payment from our customers in the functional currency of the selling subsidiary  when possible  ii entering into foreign currency exchange contracts  and iii netting asset and liability exposures denominated in similar foreign currencies to the extent possible 
we may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  anticipated revenue streams  net investments and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
in january  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts the hedges  designated as effective hedging instruments  to hedge a portion of the net investment in one of our subsidiaries that is denominated in euros 
the notional amounts of the forward contracts  which provide for the sale of euro for us dollars at a weighted average exchange rate of approximately  total  the hedges are scheduled for delivery between april and december our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in a variety of governmental or institutional securities with high credit ratings 
the investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks 
we believe that the impact of a increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our investment income and interest expense from bank loans
