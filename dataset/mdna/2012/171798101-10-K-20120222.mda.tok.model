item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and also with certain risks in item a of this report 
certain amounts in prior years financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation 
this discussion also includes forward looking statements 
please refer to cautionary information about forward looking statements in part i of this report for important information about these types of statements 
overview we are an independent oil and gas exploration and production company 
our operations are entirely located in the united states  mainly in oklahoma  new mexico  texas and kansas 
our principle business objective is to achieve profitable growth in proved reserves and production for the long term benefit of our shareholders  primarily through exploration and development 
our strategy 
table of contents centers on maximizing cash flow from our producing properties and profitably reinvesting that cash flow in exploration and development drilling 
to supplement our growth and to provide for new drilling opportunities  we also consider property acquisitions and mergers that allow us to enhance our competitive position in existing core areas or to add new areas 
in order to achieve a consistent rate of growth and mitigate risk we have historically maintained a blended portfolio of low  moderate  and higher risk exploration and development projects 
to further mitigate risk  we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
we also strive to maintain a balance between oil focused activities and gas related projects 
our operations are currently focused in two main areas the mid continent region and the permian basin 
the mid continent region consists of oklahoma  northern texas and southwest kansas 
our permian basin region encompasses west texas and southeast new mexico 
we also have operations in the gulf coast area  primarily in southeast texas 
our growth is generally funded with cash flow provided by our operating activities together with occasional sales of non strategic assets 
conservative use of leverage has long been a part of our financial strategy 
our revenue  profitability and future growth are highly dependent on the commodity prices we receive 
oil and gas prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  our ability to raise additional capital and the fair market value of our assets 
prices also affect the accounting for our oil and gas activities  including the determination of full cost accounting ceiling test writedowns 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets  liabilities  equity and proved reserves 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
any extended decline in oil and gas prices could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
summary net income totaled million  or per diluted share 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted share 
cash flow provided by operating activities totaled billion  up from billion in in  our production of mmcfe d was about flat with proved reserves increased to tcfe  adjusted for property sales  proved reserves increased 
we added bcfe of proved reserves from extensions and discoveries  replacing of production 
oil  gas and ngl sales increased to billion compared to billion a year earlier 
total assets increased by billion  or  to billion compared to billion in total debt increased by million to million compared to million at year end during we evaluated and expanded our acreage position in several key long term future drilling projects 
our exploration and development capital expenditures were billion and we had property acquisitions of million 
total exploration and development expenditures for were million and property acquisitions were million 

table of contents drilling activities were focused primarily in our mid continent and permian basin regions 
during we drilled and completed gross net wells 
of total wells drilled  gross net were in our mid continent region and gross net were in the permian basin 
we sold million of non strategic assets during proceeds from the sales were reinvested in core area exploration and development activities 
non strategic asset sales in were million 
in july  we entered into a new five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a borrowing base of billion with aggregate commitments of million 
the credit facility will mature on july  at december   our outstanding bank debt was million 
at the end of we did not have any bank borrowings outstanding 
capital expenditures our e d capital expenditures for totaled billion 
we drilled and completed gross net wells  primarily focused within our mid continent and permian basin regions 
approximately of our capital expenditures were for mid continent projects where we drilled and completed gross net wells as producers 
in the permian basin we drilled gross net wells  completing of the wells as producers 
approximately of our total capital expenditures were for permian basin projects 
we also had operations in the gulf coast region of southeast texas 
during we invested approximately of our total capital expenditures to drill gross net wells  with of the wells completed as producers 
in our e d expenditures were largely funded by cash flow provided by operating activities and sales of non strategic assets 
based on current market prices and service costs  our e d capital expenditures are presently projected to be in the range of billion 
we expect nearly all of our capital to be directed towards oil or liquids rich gas drilling in the permian basin and cana woodford shale play 
we expect our e d capital expenditures to be funded from cash flow  property sales and borrowings 
proved reserves our year end proved reserves grew to tcfe  up from tcfe at year end the increase in proved reserves is net of production of bcfe and sales of bcfe 
adjusted for the impact of property sales  proved reserves increased over reserve additions were comprised of oil and ngls and gas 
with our continued focus on liquids rich production  the amount of proved reserves comprised of liquids at year end increased to as compared to at year end proved reserves are developed at year end compared to at year end reserves added from e d totaled bcfe and bcfe were acquired via property purchases 
net negative revisions during were bcfe  which included positive bcfe driven by commodity prices 
the negative revisions relate primarily to increases in operating expenses  which shortened the economic lives of the properties 
overall  approximately of our proved reserves are in our mid continent region and are in the permian basin 
our onshore gulf coast and other onshore operations collectively make up another of total proved reserves 
less than of our total proved reserves are in the gulf of mexico 
the process of estimating quantities of oil  gas and ngl reserves is complex 
significant decisions are required in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but 
table of contents not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history  contractual arrangements and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that our reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  subjective decisions and available data for our various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in financial statement disclosures 
see note  unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures for more reserve information 
revenues all of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil  gas  and ngl production and do not include the effects of the settlements of our hedges 
while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  wide swings in commodity prices have had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
compared to  our average realized gas price decreased by and our average realized oil price increased by 
the ngl price we received also increased by 
since year end  gas prices have declined further and oil prices have remained stable 
like gas  ngl prices have also declined 
the following table presents our average realized commodity prices for the years ended  and the realized prices do not include settlements of our commodity hedging contracts 
years ended december  gas prices average henry hub price mcf average realized sales price mcf oil prices average wti cushing price bbl average realized sales price bbl ngl prices average realized sales price bbl on an energy equivalent basis  of our aggregate production was natural gas 
a per mcf change in our average realized gas sales price would have resulted in a million change in our gas revenues 
similarly  of our production was crude oil and ngl s 
a per barrel change in our average realized sales prices would have resulted in a million change in our oil and ngl revenues 
production and other operating expenses costs associated with finding and producing oil and gas are substantial 
some of these costs vary with commodity prices  some trend with the type and volume of production and others are a function of the number of wells we own 
at the end of  we owned interests in  gross wells 
production expense generally consists of the cost of water disposal  power and fuel  direct labor  third party field services  compression and certain maintenance activity workovers necessary to produce oil and gas from existing wells 
transportation expense is comprised of costs paid to move oil and gas from the wellhead to a specified sales point 
in some cases we receive a payment from purchasers which is net of transportation costs  and in other instances we separately pay for transportation 
if costs are netted in the proceeds received  both the gross revenues and gross costs are shown in sales and expenses  respectively 

table of contents depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a of our producing properties is computed using the units of production method 
the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for future sales of production 
therefore  fluctuations in oil and gas prices will impact the level of proved reserves used in the calculation 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves  which reduces depletion expense 
lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves  which increases depletion expense 
in addition  changes in estimates of reserve quantities  estimates of operating and future development costs  and reclassifications from unproved properties to proved properties will impact depletion expense 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  office rent  legal fees  consultants  systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our offices and not directly associated with exploration  development or production activities 
while we expect these costs to increase with our growth  we also expect such increases to be proportionately smaller than our production growth 
production taxes are assessed by state and local taxing authorities pertaining to production  revenues or the value of properties 
these typically include production severance  ad valorem  and excise taxes 
stock compensation expense consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock options 
in accordance with our stock incentive plan  such grants are periodically made to non employee directors  officers and other eligible employees 
the net gain or loss on derivative instruments is the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on derivative contracts  to which we did not apply hedge accounting treatment 
that amount will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of the underlying commodities 
hedging from time to time we attempt to mitigate a portion of our price risk through the use of hedging transactions 
management has been authorized to hedge up to of our anticipated and equivalent production 
in we entered into derivative contracts covering approximately of our anticipated oil and gas production volumes 
these contracts were settled in for a net gain of million 
during we entered into oil and gas contracts relative to our production which approximated to of our anticipated oil production and to of projected gas production 
those contracts were settled in for a net gain of million 
for we have hedged approximately of our anticipated oil production 
we do not have any of our gas or ngl production hedged 
as of december  we had entered into the following contracts relative to our production oil contracts weighted average price period type volume day index floor ceiling jan dec collar  bbls wti wti refers to west texas intermediate price as quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 

table of contents subsequent to december  we entered into additional oil contracts as follows weighted average price period type volume day index floor ceiling jan collar  bbls wti feb collar  bbls wti mar dec collar  bbls wti wti refers to west texas intermediate price as quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management s view of underlying supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
while the use of such instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price changes  their use may also limit future revenues from favorable price changes 
we have chosen not to apply hedge accounting treatment to any of the derivative contracts we have entered into since therefore  settlements on our derivative contracts do not impact our realized commodity prices during the periods they cover 
instead  any settlements on the contracts are shown as a component of operating costs and expenses as either a net gain or loss on derivative instruments 
see item a and note  derivative instruments hedging  to the consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
results of operations compared to net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share 
for we had net income of million  or per diluted share 
in  increased revenues from higher realized oil and ngl prices were more than offset by higher dd a and production expenses compared to these changes are discussed further in the analysis that follows 
for the years ended december  percent change between price volume analysis commodity sales price volume variance in thousands or as indicated gas sales oil sales ngl sales total commodity sales total gas volume mmcf gas volume mmcf per day average gas price per mcf total oil volume thousand barrels oil volume barrels per day average oil price per barrel total ngl volume thousand barrels ngl volume barrels per day average ngl price per barrel 
table of contents commodity sales during totaled billion  compared to billion in the increase was a result of higher realized prices for oil and ngl s 
in  our aggregate production volumes were mmcfe per day  down from mcfe per day in aggregate daily production volumes for the fourth quarter of were mmcfe  also down from mmcfe for the same period of our permian basin and mid continent production volumes continue to increase as a result of our successful drilling programs 
however  these increases are being offset by decreased gulf coast production 
the lower output from the gulf coast is a result of natural declines in the highly productive wells previously drilled near beaumont  texas combined with a lack of exploration success from our gulf coast drilling program 
our gas production averaged mmcf per day  compared to mmcf per day for the decline in year over year gas production resulted in a decrease in revenue of million 
during the fourth quarter of our daily gas production averaged mmcf per day  down from mmcf per day  for the same period of the decline in fourth quarter gas production resulted in million less revenue compared to the fourth quarter of oil production for averaged  barrels per day  down slightly from production of  barrels per day in the decrease in production resulted in million lower oil revenue for all of our fourth quarter oil production averaged  barrels per day  or a slight increase compared to daily oil production of  barrels for the fourth quarter of the higher production in the fourth quarter of increased oil sales by million 
in our average daily ngl production volume was  barrels per day compared to  barrels per day for the higher ngl production volumes in contributed million of additional revenue for during the fourth quarter of our average daily ngl production was  barrels per day  up from  barrels per day during the fourth quarter of this increase in ngl production provided an additional million of revenue in the fourth quarter of the increases in our ngl production reflect our continued focus on drilling in more liquids rich gas basins that produce more attractively priced ngl liquids such as ethane  propane and butane  rather than in gas basins that produce dry gas alone 
our average realized gas price for fell to per mcf  compared to per mcf in the decrease in prices received during resulted in lower gas sales of million in compared to gas revenue 
during the fourth quarter of our average realized gas price decreased by to per mcf 
for the same period of  we realized an average price per mcf of 
the decrease in prices received in the fourth quarter of resulted in million less in gas sales compared to the same period of realized oil prices during averaged per barrel  an increase of over the average price received for oil in of per barrel 
this increase resulted in an additional million of oil sales in for the fourth quarter of our average realized oil price was per barrel versus per barrel received in the fourth quarter of the increase in fourth quarter oil sales due to the increase in oil prices totaled million 
during our average realized price for ngls was per barrel  which was higher than the average realized price of per barrel received in the increase in realized price resulted in an additional million for ngl sales in in the fourth quarter of our average realized price for ngls was per barrel compared to an average realized price of per barrel received in the 
table of contents fourth quarter of the increase in the fourth quarter ngl realized price contributed million of additional revenue

in  third party gas gathering  processing and other contributed million of pre tax cash operating margin revenues less direct expenses versus million in our gas marketing margin revenues less purchases increased to thousand in up from thousand in changes in net margins from gas gathering  processing  marketing and other activities are the direct result of volumetric changes and overall market conditions 
for the years ended december  variance between operating costs and expenses in thousands depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a asset retirement obligation production transportation taxes other than income general and administrative stock compensation  net gain loss on derivative instruments  net other operating  net total operating costs and expenses not including gas gathering  marketing and processing costs  or income tax expense increased to million in compared to million in analyses of the year over year differences are discussed below 
for dd a was million  compared to million in the million increase in expense represents of the total increase in operating costs and expenses 
on a unit of production basis  the dd a rate for was per mcfe  up from per mcfe for the dd a rate in was lower as a result of impairments to the carrying value of our oil and gas properties recorded during the last half of and the first quarter of we expect the average dd a rate to continue to increase during asset retirement obligation expense increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to unforeseen modifications and or problems that occurred at the time of actual abandonment and site restoration  which resulted in our actual costs exceeding our estimated asset retirement obligation 

table of contents in our production costs were million per mcfe up from million per mcfe during the million increase accounted for of our total increase in operating costs and expenses 
our production costs consist of lease operating expense and workover expense as follows in thousands for the years ended december  variance between lease operating expense workover expense about half of the million increase in our lease operating expense resulted from higher water disposal costs associated with wells coming on line from our successful permian basin and mid continent drilling programs 
increased costs for equipment maintenance  rentals  labor  power and fuel also contributed to the increase in year over year lease operating expense 
workover expense for was million higher than  primarily as a result of more activity being necessary in transportation costs rose to million per mcfe for from million per mcfe in transportation costs will fluctuate based on increases or decreases in sales volumes  compression charges and fluctuation in the price of the fuel cost component 
also  in the latter part of and continuing throughout  our mid continent and permian basin wells have experienced increases in transportation rates due to higher contractual rates associated with new wells coming online and contracts for existing wells being renewed 
taxes other than income increased million from million in to million in the million increase in taxes resulted primarily from higher realized oil and ngl prices in our general and administrative expense was million in compared to million for the million decrease is mostly due to lower bonus expense in stock compensation expense  net consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock option awards  net of amounts capitalized 
we have recognized non cash stock based compensation cost as follows in thousands for the years ended december  variance between performance based restricted stock awards service based restricted stock awards restricted unit awards restricted stock and units stock option awards total stock compensation less amounts capitalized to oil and gas properties stock compensation  net expense associated with stock compensation will fluctuate based on the grant date market value of the award and the number of awards granted 
the million increase in total stock compensation  net compared to the total expense resulted primarily from the increased price per share of our common stock on the date of grants in compared to the grant date value of previous awards 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for a detailed discussion regarding our stock based compensation 

table of contents our net gain or loss on derivative instruments includes both realized gains and losses on settlements of our derivative contracts and unrealized gains and losses stemming from changes in the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments 
we estimate the fair values of these instruments based on published forward commodity price curves for the underlying commodity as of the date of the estimate 
for collars  we estimate the option value of the contract floors and ceilings using an option pricing model which takes into account market volatility  market prices and contract terms 
the fair value of our derivative instruments in an asset position include a measure of counterparty credit risk  and the fair value of instruments in a liability position include a measure of our own nonperformance risk 
these credit risks are based on current published credit default swap rates 
we did not elect hedge accounting treatment for derivative contracts outstanding in and therefore we recognized all realized settlements and unrealized changes in fair value in our operating costs and expenses 
the following table reflects our net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments for the years ended december  variance between in thousands realized gain on settlement of derivative instruments unrealized gain from changes to the fair value of the derivative instruments gain on derivative instruments  net realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts are a function of fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices and the monthly settlement of the instruments 
in we recorded million lower gains on our derivative instruments than in  primarily due to lower realized gas prices in the million of lower gains accounted for of our total increase in operating costs and expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report for a complete discussion of our derivative instruments 
other operating  net expense consists of costs related to various legal matters  most of which pertain to litigation and contract settlements and title and royalty issues 
other operating  net increased from million in to million for expenses for were significantly lower than in due to the favorable resolution of items in that had been accrued in prior years 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in this report for further information regarding litigation matters 
other income and expense interest expense for was million compared to million for our interest expense includes interest on outstanding borrowings  amortization of financing costs and miscellaneous interest expense 
our senior notes accounted for and of our and interest expense  respectively 
capitalized interest remained relatively flat at approximately million for both and components of other  net consist of miscellaneous income and expense items that will vary from period to period  including  gain or loss on the sale or value of oil and gas well equipment  other miscellaneous asset sales  income and expense from other non operating activities and interest income 
other  net increased from million of income in to million of income in the million increase in was mainly due to sales of oil and gas well equipment and supplies 

table of contents income tax for the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million  of which million is a current tax benefit 
this compares with income tax expense of million  which included million of current tax expense 
the combined federal and state effective income tax rates were for both and the effective tax rate of for differs from the statutory rate of due to the effects of state income taxes  the domestic production activities allowance and other permanent differences

results of operations compared to for the year ended december   net income totaled million  or per diluted share 
this compares to a net loss of million  or per share for the increase in net income results from increased production and the improvement of realized oil and gas prices 
in addition  in we recorded a million non cash full cost ceiling write down  which was the main reason for the net loss in these changes are discussed further in the analysis that follows

our fourth quarter oil production averaged  barrels per day  or an increase of compared to average daily production of  barrels for the 
table of contents fourth quarter of the higher production in the fourth quarter of increased oil sales by million 
during we began separately reporting ngl volumes 
the determination of whether to record and separately disclose ngl volumes is based on where title transfer occurs during processing of the well stream 
new gas processing contracts and certain contractual amendments resulted in title of ngl volumes transferring to the company 
our average daily ngl production volumes were  barrels per day 
this compares to average daily ngl volumes for all of of barrels per day 
the higher production volumes in contributed an additional million of revenue 
for the fourth quarter of our average daily ngl production was  barrels per day  up from barrels per day during the fourth quarter of this increase provided an additional million of revenue in the fourth quarter of overall  increases in our production volumes primarily reflect positive drilling results in our western oklahoma cana woodford shale play  our permian basin oil programs and our yegua cook mountain play in southeast texas

this occurred because of hurricane damage to our offshore properties which caused additional expenses to be incurred during site restoration 
our production costs consist of lease operating expense and workover expense 
our aggregate costs for of million were higher than aggregate costs of million 
approximately of the aggregate increase relates to higher operating expense associated primarily with new wells we ve drilled in and our workover expenditures in accounted for the remainder of the increase 
our average cost per mcfe decreased  from per mcfe in to per mcfe in the decrease in rate resulted from our continued focus on efficiencies in production operations 
however  we expect to see our production cost per mcfe begin to trend upward  due to expected increases in certain service costs 

table of contents transportation costs rose to million per mcfe for from million per mcfe in transportation costs will fluctuate based on increases or decreases in sales volumes and fluctuation in the price of the fuel cost component

for further information on litigation matters please see contingencies under critical accounting policies and estimates in this report 
other income and expense our interest expense was million compared to million for the million decrease resulted from lower average bank debt outstanding during compared to during we only had bank borrowings outstanding in the first quarter of the year 
this resulted in average daily bank debt outstanding of million for during our average daily bank debt outstanding was million

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our liquidity is highly dependent on the commodity prices we receive 
oil and gas prices are market driven and historically have been very volatile 
we cannot predict future commodity prices 
the prices we receive for our production heavily influence our revenue  cash flow  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
the prices we receive for natural gas have significantly declined since year end  primarily as a result of an oversupply of natural gas and an exceptionally mild winter 
the prices we receive for oil and ngls may fluctuate during  depending on global supply and demand  seasonality and other economic factors 
we intend to deal with volatility in the current commodity price environment by maintaining flexibility in our planned capital investment program for based on current market prices and service costs  our e d capital expenditures are presently projected to be in the range of billion 
we expect nearly all of our capital to be directed towards oil or liquids rich gas drilling in the permian basin and cana woodford shale play 
historically our exploration and development expenditures have generally been funded by cash flow provided by operating activities operating cash flow 
during  our e d expenditures of billion were largely funded by operating cash flow and sales of non strategic assets 
we expect our e d capital expenditures to be funded by operating cash flow  property sales and long term debt 
we have hedged a portion of our oil production to protect our operating cash flow for reinvestment 
from time to time we consider acquisition opportunities 
however  the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
to stay prepared for potential acquisitions and possible declines in commodity prices  we have a revolving credit facility which provides for bank commitments of million 
our credit facility is described in more detail under long term debt below 
at december   our total debt outstanding was million  which is comprised of million of bank debt and million of our notes due our debt to total capitalization ratio at year end was 
the reconciliation of debt to total capitalization  which is a non gaap measure  is long term debt of million divided by long term debt of million plus stockholders equity of billion 
management believes that this non gaap measure is useful information and it is a common statistic referred to by the investment community 
we believe that our operating cash flow and other capital resources will be adequate to continue to meet our needs for our planned capital expenditures  working capital  debt servicing  and dividend payments for and beyond 
sources and uses of cash our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are operating cash flow  asset sales  borrowings under our bank credit facility and public offerings of debt securities

table of contents reconciliation of cash flow from operations for the year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities change in operating assets and liabilities cash flow from operations management believes that the non gaap measure of cash flow from operations is useful information for investors because it is used internally and is accepted by the investment community as a means of measuring the company s ability to fund its capital program 
it is also used by professional research analysts in providing investment recommendations pertaining to companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
capital expenditures the following table sets forth certain historical information regarding capitalized expenditures for our oil and gas acquisition  exploration and development activities and property sales in thousands for years ended december  acquisitions proved unproved exploration and development land seismic exploration development property sales the negative balance reflects purchase price adjustments related to an acreage acquisition in the fourth quarter of capital expenditures in the table above are presented on an accrual basis 
additions to property and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report reflect capital expenditures on a cash basis  when payments are made 
in our exploration and development expenditures were billion  compared to billion in and billion in during we drilled and completed gross net wells 
in we drilled and completed gross net wells  versus gross net wells drilled and completed in at year end we had operated rigs running  compared to at the end of and at the end of based on current market prices and service costs  our e d capital expenditures are presently projected to be in the range of billion 
we expect nearly all of our capital to be directed towards oil or liquids rich gas drilling in the permian basin and cana woodford shale play 
we expect our 
table of contents e d capital expenditures to be funded from cash flow  property sales and long term debt 
the timing of capital expenditures and the receipt of cash flows do not necessarily match 
for example  our planned capital expenditures are front end loaded and we may outspend cash flows for a period of time 
therefore  we may borrow and repay funds under our credit arrangement throughout the year 
as has been our historical practice  we regularly review our capital expenditures throughout the year and will adjust our investments based on changes in commodity prices  service costs and drilling success 
we have the flexibility to adjust our capital expenditures based upon market conditions 
during  we had property acquisitions of approximately million of which million was in our western oklahoma cana woodford shale play and million was in the permian basin 
in we had property acquisitions of million  primarily for additional interests in our cana woodford shale play 
of this total amount  million was for proved properties 
the remainder was for undeveloped acreage 
in we also had land and seismic purchases of million  of which was in the permian basin 
we made no significant property acquisitions in in august  we sold all of our interests in assets located in sublette county  wyoming for million including purchase price adjustments 
the assets sold principally consisted of a gas processing plant under construction and related assets million and bcf of proved undeveloped gas reserves million 
no gain or loss was recognized on the sale of proved reserves as the disposition did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
at june  the gas processing plant and related assets and liabilities were classified as assets held for sale 
we determined that the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities were equal to their fair value  therefore no gain or loss was recognized on the sale 
because the gas plant was still under construction we had not recognized any income or expense related to plant operations in our statements of operations 
the sales contract also provides for a maximum million contingent payment to be made to cimarex if certain operational and performance goals related to the start up of the gas processing plant are met 
the contingent payment is expected to be received in the second quarter of also during  we sold various non core interests in oil and gas properties for approximately million  including our assets in lea county  new mexico and willacy county  texas 
various interests in oil and gas properties were sold during for million  most of which were our non core mississippi assets 
during we sold various interests in non core oil and gas properties for million 
approximately of the sales were our westbrook field interests in our permian basin region 
we intend to continue to actively evaluate acquisitions and dispositions relative to our property holdings  particularly in our core areas of operation 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with environmental and safety regulations and requirements 
these costs are considered a normal recurring cost of our ongoing operations and not an extraordinary cost of compliance 
we do not anticipate that we will be required to expend amounts that will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations  nor are we aware of any pending regulatory changes that would have a material impact 
our exploration and development drilling program is discussed in more detail in exploration and development activity overview under item of this report 
financial condition future cash flows and the availability of financing will be subject to a number of variables  such as our success in locating and producing new reserves  the level of production from existing wells and realized commodity prices 
to meet our capital and liquidity requirements  we rely on certain resources  including 
table of contents cash flows from operating activities  bank borrowings and access to capital markets 
we anticipate periodically accessing our credit facility to finance our working capital needs and growth 
during our total assets increased by billion to billion  up from billion at december  the increase was primarily due to a billion increase in our net oil and gas properties which was partially offset by a decrease of million in our cash and cash equivalents 
our total liabilities at the end of had increased by million to billion  up from billion at year end year over year current liabilities increased by million  primarily as a result of increases in operations related accounts payable 
long term deferred income taxes increased during by million and long term debt outstanding increased by million 
at december   stockholders equity totaled billion  up from billion at december  the million increase is primarily the result of our net income 
dividends in a quarterly cash dividend of per share was paid 
the dividend was increased to per share in february and to per share in february future dividend payments will depend on our level of earnings  financial requirements and other factors considered relevant by the board of directors 
common stock repurchase program in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to four million shares of our common stock 
the authorization expired on december  through december   we repurchased and cancelled a total of  shares at an overall average price of 
no shares have been repurchased since the quarter ended september  working capital analysis our working capital balance fluctuates primarily as a result of our exploration and development activities  our realized commodity prices and our production operating activities 
working capital is also impacted by our current tax provisions  accrued g a and changes in the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments 
our working capital balance decreased million from million at year end to a deficit of million at december  working capital decreased primarily because of the following cash and cash equivalents decreased by million as cash was used primarily to fund our e d activity 
our operations related accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by million 
accrued liabilities related to our e d expenditures increased by million 
prepaid expenses decreased by million 
these working capital decreases were partially offset by our operations related accounts receivable increased by million 
income tax receivable increased by million 
our receivables are a major component of our working capital and are made up of a diverse group of companies including major energy companies  pipeline companies  local distribution companies and 
table of contents end users in various industries 
the collection of receivables during the period presented has been timely 
historically  losses associated with uncollectible receivables have not been significant 
long term debt debt at december  and consisted of the following in thousands bank debt notes due total long term debt bank debt in july  we entered into a new five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a borrowing base of billion with aggregate commitments of million from lenders 
the facility matures july  the borrowing base under the credit facility is determined at the discretion of lenders based on the value of our proved reserves 
the next regular annual redetermination date is on april  at cimarex s option  borrowings under the credit facility may bear interest at either a libor plus  based on our leverage ratio  or b the higher of i a prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus  or iii adjusted one month libor plus plus  in each case  an additional  based on our leverage ratio 
the credit facility also has financial covenants that include the maintenance of current assets including unused bank commitments to current liabilities of greater than to we also must maintain a leverage ratio of total debt to earnings before interest expense  income taxes and noncash items such as depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives  ceiling test write downs  and goodwill impairments of not more than to other covenants could limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase our common stock  or sell assets 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial and nonfinancial covenants 
at december   there were million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at a prime interest rate of 
we also had letters of credit outstanding of million leaving an unused borrowing availability of million 
during we had an average daily bank debt outstanding of million  compared to million for the same period of our largest amount of bank borrowings outstanding during was million occurring in mid july 
during our largest amount of outstanding bank borrowings was million in mid january 
notes due in may   we issued million of senior unsecured notes that mature may  at par 
interest on the notes is payable may and november of each year 
the notes are governed by an indenture containing covenants that could limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or repurchase our common stock  make investments and other restricted payments  incur liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  engage in transactions with affiliates  sell assets  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 

table of contents the notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at any time on and after may  at the following redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal amount plus accrued interest  if any  thereon to the date of redemption 
percentage and thereafter if a specified change of control occurs  subject to certain conditions  we must make an offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the purchase 
off balance sheet arrangements we may enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the material off balance sheet arrangements that we have entered into included operating lease agreements  all of which are customary in the oil and gas industry 
contractual obligations and material commitments at december   we had contractual obligations and material commitments as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands debt fixed rate interest payments operating leases drilling commitments gas facilities and pipelines asset retirement obligation other liabilities firm transportation see item a interest rate risk for more information regarding fixed and variable rate debt 
in we entered into a year lease agreement for new office space in tulsa  oklahoma  which increased our aggregate minimum lease commitments beginning december by approximately million over the term of this lease 
we have drilling commitments of approximately million consisting of obligations to finish drilling and completing wells in progress at december  we also have various commitments for drilling rigs as well as certain service contracts 
the total minimum expenditure commitments under these agreements are million to secure the use of drilling rigs and million to secure certain dedicated services associated with completion activities 
we have projects in oklahoma  new mexico  and texas where we are constructing gathering facilities and pipelines 
at december   we had commitments of million relating to this construction 

table of contents we have not included the long term asset retirement obligations because we are not able to precisely predict the timing of these amounts 
other liabilities include the fair value of our liabilities associated with our benefit obligations  derivative contracts and other miscellaneous commitments 
at december   we had firm sales contracts to deliver approximately bcf of natural gas over the next eight months 
if this gas is not delivered  our financial commitment would be approximately million 
this commitment will fluctuate due to price volatility and actual volumes delivered 
however  we believe no financial commitment will be due based on our current proved reserves and production levels 
in connection with gas gathering and processing agreements  we have commitments to deliver a minimum of bcf of gas over the next four years 
the production from certain wells is counted toward those commitments  these wells also have individual commitments for gas deliveries 
if no gas is delivered  the maximum amount that would be payable under these commitments would be approximately million  some of which would be reimbursed by working interest owners who are selling with us under our marketing agreements 
we do not expect to make significant payments relative to these commitments 
we have various other delivery commitments in the normal course of business  which are individually and in the aggregate not material 
all of the noted commitments were routine and were made in the normal course of business 
based on current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production  we believe that the estimated net cash generated from operations  amounts available under our existing bank credit facility and occasional sales of non strategic assets will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs  including satisfying our financial obligations and funding our operations and planned exploration  development and other capital expenditures 
outlook our exploration and development capital investment is presently expected to be in the range of billion 
we expect nearly all of our capital to be directed towards oil or liquids rich gas drilling in the permian and cana woodford shale play 
we have a large inventory of drilling opportunities  limited lease expirations and few service commitments 
actual amounts invested will depend on our calculated rate of return which is significantly influenced by commodity prices 
as has been our historical practice  we regularly review our capital expenditures throughout the year and will adjust our investments based on changes in commodity prices  service cost and drilling success 
operationally we have the flexibility to adjust our capital expenditures based upon market conditions 
though there are a variety of factors that could curtail  delay or even cancel some of our planned operations  we believe our projected program is likely to occur 
the majority of projects are in hand  drilling rigs are being scheduled  and the historical results of our drilling efforts warrant pursuit of the projects 
production for is projected to be in the range of to mmcfe per day  or a growth over revenues from production will be dependent not only on the level of oil and gas actually produced  but also the prices that will be realized 
during  our realized prices averaged per mcf of gas  per barrel of oil  and per barrel of ngl 
commodity prices can be very volatile and the possibility of realized prices varying from prices in is high 

table of contents certain expenses for on a per mcfe basis are currently estimated as follows production expense transportation expense dd a and asset retirement obligation general and administrative production taxes of oil and gas revenue critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
a complete list of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve significant judgments and discuss the selection and development of these policies and estimates with our audit committee 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that our reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  subjective decisions and available data for our various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in financial statement disclosures 
at year end  of our total proved reserves are categorized as proved undeveloped 
of these proved undeveloped reserves  is related to our western oklahoma  cana woodford shale play 
our reserve engineers review and revise our reserve estimates regularly  as new information becomes available 
we use the units of production method to amortize the cost of our oil and gas properties 
changes in our estimate of reserve quantities and commodity prices will cause corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to these changes  or in some cases  a full cost ceiling limitation charge in the period of the revision 
the following table presents information regarding reserve revisions largely resulting from items we do not control  such as revisions due to price  and other revisions resulting from better information about production history  well performance and production costs 

table of contents net negative revisions during of bcfe  which included a positive bcfe driven by commodity prices  relate primarily to increases in operating expenses which shortened the economic lives of the properties 
years ended december  bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves revisions resulting from price changes other changes in estimates total see note  unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures in this report for additional reserve data 
full cost accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities  and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of properties  as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration  and development activities  are also capitalized 
under the full cost method of accounting  no gain or loss is recognized upon the disposition of oil and gas properties unless such disposition would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
companies that follow the full cost accounting method are required to make quarterly ceiling test calculations 
this test ensures that total capitalized costs for oil and gas properties net of accumulated dd a and deferred income taxes do not exceed the sum of the present value discounted at of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  the cost of properties not being amortized  the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized  and all related tax effects 
we currently do not have any unproven properties that are being amortized 
revenue calculations in the reserves are based on the unweighted average first day of the month prices for the prior twelve months 
changes in proved reserve estimates whether based upon quantity revisions or commodity prices will cause corresponding changes to the full cost ceiling limitation 
if net capitalized costs subject to amortization exceed this limit  the excess would be charged to expense 
any recorded impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
our quarterly and annual ceiling tests are primarily impacted by commodity prices  reserve quantities added and produced  overall exploration and development costs and depletion expense 
holding all factors constant other than commodity prices  a decline in prices as of december  would not have resulted in a ceiling test impairment 
however  oil and gas prices are market driven and historically have been very volatile 
since year end  oil prices have been relatively stable while gas and ngl prices have declined 
further declines in prices could cause impairment of our oil and gas properties 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties of million million after tax as a result of declines in gas prices 
depletion of proved oil and gas properties is computed on the units of production method  whereby capitalized costs  including future development costs and asset retirement obligations  are amortized over total estimated proved reserves 
the capitalized costs of unproved properties  including those in wells in progress  are excluded from the costs being amortized 
we do not have major development projects that 
table of contents are excluded from costs being amortized 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate excluded costs for inclusion in the costs to be amortized resulting from the determination of proved reserves or impairments 
to the extent that the evaluation indicates these properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to production expense in the period incurred 
goodwill accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and intangible net assets acquired with any excess recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually 
the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units 
cimarex is one reporting unit 
the fair value is estimated and compared to the net book value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the net book value  including goodwill  then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense 
the annual impairment test  which we conduct during the fourth quarter  requires us to estimate the fair value of the company 
the most significant judgments involved in estimating our fair value relates to the valuation of our oil and gas assets 
we develop estimated fair value of our oil and gas assets by performing various discounted cash flow analyses 
due to volatility in the stock markets  management does not consider the market value of our shares to be an accurate reflection of the fair value of our net assets for goodwill impairment purposes 
based upon our assessment at december   no impairment of goodwill is required 
unfavorable changes in reserves or in our price forecast would increase the likelihood of a goodwill impairment charge 
a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or capital resources 
however  it would adversely affect our results of operations in that period 
contingencies a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes subjective judgment 
in many cases  this judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
we closely monitor known and potential legal  environmental  and other contingencies and periodically determine when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us 
in january  the tulsa county district court issued a judgment totaling million in the hb krug  et al versus h p case 
this lawsuit was originally filed in and addressed h p s conduct pertaining to a take or pay settlement  along with potential drainage issues and other related matters 
pursuant to the spin off transaction to shareholders of h p by which cimarex became a publicly traded entity  cimarex assumed the assets and liabilities of h p s exploration and production business 
in we recorded litigation expense of million for this lawsuit 
we have accrued additional expense for associated post judgment interest and costs that have accrued during the appeal of the district court s judgments 
on august   the oklahoma court of appeals issued an opinion regarding the krug litigation 
the oklahoma court of appeals reversed and remanded the million disgorgement of profits award  finding the district court erred in failing to make the required findings of fact and conclusions of law 
in all other respects  the court of appeals affirmed the judgment  including damages of million 
on october   cimarex filed a petition with the oklahoma supreme court requesting review of the affirmed portion of the judgment 
this case is subject to further appeal and the final outcome cannot be 
table of contents determined at this time 
if the district court s original judgment is ultimately affirmed in its entirety  the million  plus the then determined amount of post judgment interest and costs would become payable 
in the normal course of business  we have other various litigation related matters 
we assess the probability of estimable amounts related to litigation matters in accordance with guidance established by the fasb and adjust our accruals accordingly 
though some of the related claims may be significant  the resolution of them we believe  individually or in the aggregate  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
see note of this report for additional information regarding our contingencies 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
for example  as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment information  we may revise our estimates of current costs  the assumed annual inflation of these costs and or the assumed productive lives of our wells depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
see note of this report for additional information regarding our asset retirement obligations 
recently issued accounting standards the fasb has issued final guidance on goodwill impairment that permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it would not be required to perform the two step impairment test for that reporting unit 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
price fluctuations our major market risk is pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
the prices we receive for our production are based on prevailing market conditions and are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control 
pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable 
we periodically hedge a portion of our price risk associated with our future oil and gas production 

table of contents the following table details the contracts we have in place as of december  oil contracts weighted average price fair value period type volume day index floor ceiling s jan dec collar  bbls wti wti refers to west texas intermediate price as quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
while these contracts limit the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
for the contracts listed above  a hypothetical change in the price below or above the contracted price applied to the notional amounts would cause a change in our gain loss on mark to market derivatives in of  subsequent to december  we entered into additional oil collars 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
in spite of the recent turmoil in the financial markets  counterparty credit risk did not have a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and commodity derivative valuations 
this is primarily the result of two factors 
first  we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties 
second  our derivative contracts are held with investment grade counterparties that are a part of our credit facility 
interest rate risk at december   our debt was comprised of the following in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt bank debt notes due total long term debt as of december   the amounts outstanding under our five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility bears interest at either a libor plus  based on our leverage ratio  or b the higher of i a prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus  or iii adjusted one month libor plus plus  in each case  an additional  based on our leverage ratio 
our senior unsecured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and will mature on may  we consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because approximately of our long term debt obligations were at fixed rates 
an increase of basis points in the interest rate of our variable rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by  this sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments
