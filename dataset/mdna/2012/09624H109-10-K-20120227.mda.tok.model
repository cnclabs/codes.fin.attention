in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this form k contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties

overview company background bluelinx is a leading distributor of building products in the united states 
as of december   we distributed approximately  products from over suppliers to service approximately  customers nationwide  including dealers  industrial manufacturers  manufactured housing producers and home improvement retailers 
we operate our distribution business from sales centers in atlanta and denver  and our network of approximately distribution centers 
we distribute products in two principal categories structural products and specialty products 
structural products include plywood  osb  rebar and remesh  lumber and other wood products primarily used for structural support  walls and flooring in construction projects 
structural products represented approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 
specialty products include roofing  insulation  moulding  engineered wood  vinyl products used primarily in siding  outdoor living and metal products excluding rebar and remesh 
specialty products accounted for approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 

table of contents industry conditions a number of factors cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
many of these factors are seasonal or cyclical in nature 
conditions in the united states housing market are at historically low levels 
our operating results are closely tied to united states housing starts  and therefore have declined during the past several years 
additionally  the mortgage markets have experienced substantial disruption due to a rising number of defaults and historically high levels of foreclosures 
this disruption and the related defaults have increased the inventory of homes for sale and also have caused lenders to tighten mortgage qualification criteria which further reduces demand for new homes 
we expect the downturn in new housing activity will continue to negatively impact our operating results for the foreseeable future 
we continue to prudently manage our inventories  receivables and spending in this environment 
along with many forecasters  however  we believe united states housing demand will improve in the long term based on population demographics and a variety of other factors 
stock rights offering on july   we concluded an offering of our common stock to our stockholders the rights offering  pursuant to which we distributed to our common stockholders transferable rights to subscribe for and purchase up to million of our common stock 
the rights offering was fully subscribed and resulted in gross proceeds of approximately million 
the majority of the proceeds from the rights offering of approximately million were used to pay down the us revolving credit facility 
we accounted for the rights issued as a component of additional paid in capital as they were indexed to the company s equity and there were no net cash settlement provisions 
the amendment to our us revolving credit facility  which was a condition to the rights offering  became effective upon the successful completion of the rights offering 
in addition  as a condition to the rights offering  we entered into an amendment to our mortgage 
tender offer on july   our board of directors our board received notice from our largest stockholder  cerberus abp investor llc cai that it intended to make a tender offer for the shares of our stock it did not own for in cash per share 
our board formed a special committee the special committee consisting of our three independent directors  to evaluate the tender offer 
the special committee was granted full power and authority to evaluate the proposal to determine our recommendation to our stockholders with respect to any tender offer commenced by cai and to take any other action it determined to be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders 
completion of the tender offer was subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions  including that as result of the tender offer  cai would own of our issued and outstanding shares  which we refer to as the condition 
on september   cai and cerberus increased the purchase price to be paid in their cash tender offer to per share for all our outstanding publicly held shares not owned by cai or its affiliates 
on september   the special committee unanimously determined  by all members participating in the deliberations  that the tender offer was fair  from a financial point of view  to our stockholders other than cai and cerberus capital 
additionally  the special committee recommended  on behalf of us and the board  that our stockholders accept the tender offer and tender their shares 
on october   cai announced that the condition had not been satisfied and  as a result  the tender offer expired without cai purchasing any shares 
during fiscal  we incurred charges relating to stock valuation and legal fees of million as a result of the tender offer 
these charges were included in selling  general  and administrative expenses in our statements of operations 
supply agreement with g p on april   we entered into a modification agreement related to our supply agreement with g p 
the modification agreement effectively terminated the existing supply agreement with respect to our distribution of g p plywood  osb and lumber 
as a result of terminating this agreement  we are no longer contractually obligated to make minimum purchases of products from g p 
we continue to distribute a variety of g p building products 

table of contents g p agreed to pay us million in exchange for our agreement to terminate the supply agreement one year earlier than the may  termination date previously agreed upon 
under the terms of the modification agreement  we received four quarterly cash payments of million  which began on may  and ended on february  as a result of the termination  we recognized a net gain of million in  as a reduction to operating expense 
the gain was net of a million write off of an intangible asset associated with the supply agreement 
we believe the early termination of the supply agreement contributed to the decline in our structural panel sales volume during fiscal  and however  because the majority of these sales are through the direct sales channel  the lower structural panel sales volume had an insignificant impact on our gross profit during these periods 
to the extent we are unable to replace these volumes with structural product from g p or other suppliers  the early termination of the supply agreement may continue to negatively impact our sales of structural products which could impact our net sales and our costs  which in turn could impact our gross profit  net income  and cash flows 
on february   our three year purchase agreement with g p for engineered lumber expired in accordance with its terms 
in february of  we launched our own privately branded engineered product line for all geographic markets other than new england 
in addition  on february  we entered into a supply agreement with weyerhaeuser company for the sale of certain engineered wood products in the new england region 
at this time we cannot predict what impact this product change will have on our gross profit  net income and cash flows 
osb litigation settlement until the third quarter of fiscal  we were a claimant in a class action lawsuit pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging that the following manufacturers of oriented strand board osb conspired in violation of federal antitrust law to restrict the supply of osb structural panel products and raise prices louisiana pacific corporation  weyerhaeuser company  g p llc f k a georgia pacific corporation  ainsworth lumber co 
ltd  potlatch corporation  norbord industries inc  tolko industries ltd  grant forest products inc and grant forest products sales inc  and jm huber corporation or huber engineered woods llc collectively  the defendants 
on september   we received a cash settlement in the amount of million in satisfaction of our claims under the class action lawsuit 
this million was recognized as a gain in selling  general  and administrative expenses in our statements of operations for fiscal year defined benefit pension plans we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our hourly employees 
our estimates of the amount and timing of our future funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans are based upon various assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  projected return on plan assets  compensation increase rates  mortality rates  retirement patterns  and turnover rates 
in addition  the amount and timing of our pension funding obligations can be influenced by funding requirements that are established by the employee retirement income and security act of erisa  the pension protection act  congressional acts  or other governing bodies 
during fiscal and  we met our required contribution to our defined benefit pension plans 
we recognize the unfunded status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of our pension plan in our consolidated balance sheets  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax  offset by a valuation allowance 
on december   we measured the fair value of our plan assets and benefit obligations 
as of december  and january   the net unfunded status of our benefit plan was million and million  respectively 
these amounts were included in other non current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the net adjustment to other comprehensive loss for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal was million loss million net of tax offset by a valuation allowance  million loss million loss  net of tax  and million gain million gain  net of tax  respectively  which represents the net unrecognized actuarial loss gain and unrecognized prior service cost 
the company s required cash contribution to the pension plan in is approximately million 
this contribution is comprised of approximately million related to our minimum required contribution and approximately million related to our minimum required contribution 
the company s minimum required contribution for plan 
table of contents year is million 
the company will fund the million related to its minimum required contribution with cash in however  in an effort to preserve additional cash for operations  we intend to seek a waiver from the irs for our minimum required contribution 
if we are granted the requested waiver  our contributions for will be deferred and amortized over the following five years  increasing our future minimum required contributions 
we used a discount rate of to compute pension expense  which was determined by matching of plan liability cash flows to a portfolio of bonds 
a decrease in the discount rate of basis points  from to  while holding all other assumptions constant  would have resulted in an increase in the company s pension expense of approximately million in we used a long term rate of return of to compute pension expense 
a decrease in the long term rate of return of basis points  from to  while holding all other assumptions constant  would have resulted in an increase in the company s pension expense of approximately million in we used an estimated rate of future compensation increases of to compute pension expense 
an increase in the rate of basis points  from to  while holding all other assumptions constant  would have resulted in an increase in the company s pension expense of less than million in plan assets are managed as a balanced portfolio comprised of two major components an equity portion and a fixed income portion 
the expected role of plan equity investments will be to maximize the long term real growth of fund assets  while the role of fixed income investments will be to generate current income  provide for more stable periodic returns  and provide some downside protection against the possibility of a prolonged decline in the market value of equity investments 
we review this investment policy statement at least once per year 
in addition  the portfolio will be reviewed quarterly with our investment consultant to determine whether the current target allocations and or investments are appropriate for meeting our long term financial objectives 
if it is concluded that changes are needed to either the target allocations or current investments in order to meet current target allocations  we adjust as needed based on these discussions 
target allocations for fiscal are domestic and international equity investments  fixed income investments  and cash 
the expected long term rate of return for the plan s total assets is based on the expected return of each of the above categories  weighted based on the target allocation for each class 
restructuring charges during fiscal  we announced a plan to adjust our cost structure in order to manage our costs more effectively 
the plan included the consolidation of our corporate headquarters and sales center to one building from two buildings which resulted in charges of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an amendment to our corporate headquarters lease in atlanta  ga related to the unoccupied building 
this amendment released us from our obligations with respect to this unoccupied space as of january   in exchange for a million space remittance fee  due on or before that date 
in addition  we are obligated to pay million on or before december  to be used for tenant improvements 
the provisions relating to the occupied building remain unchanged 
under the existing provisions  the current term of the lease ends on january  the amendment resulted in a reduction of our restructuring reserve of approximately million  with the credit recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value for all share based payment awards that are expected to vest 
this expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award  unless the awards are subject to market or performance conditions  in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche to the extent market and performance conditions are considered probable 
the calculation of fair value related to stock compensation is subject to certain assumptions discussed in more detail in note management updates such estimates when circumstances warrant 
all compensation expense related to our share based payment awards is recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations

seasonality we are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors 
these seasonal factors are common in the building products distribution industry 
the first and fourth quarters are typically our slowest quarters due to the impact of poor weather on the construction market 
our second and third quarters are typically our strongest quarters  reflecting a substantial increase in construction due to more favorable weather conditions 
our working capital generally peaks in the third quarter  related to the building season 
during fiscal year we experienced significant business disruption  in excess of normal seasonal fluctuations  due to the record snow fall in the northeast in the winter months 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facilities to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures 
we had approximately million of excess availability under our us revolving credit facility the us revolving credit facility and million under our canadian revolving credit facility  described further below  as of december  as of the period ended december   under our amended us revolving credit facility  we were required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of to in the event our excess availability falls below the greater of million or the amount equal to of the lesser of the borrowing base or million 
if we fail to maintain this minimum excess availability  the amended us revolving credit facility requires us to i maintain certain financial ratios  which we would not meet with current operating results  and ii limit our capital expenditures  which would have a negative impact on our ability to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures 
as of december   we had excess availability above the minimum required under the us revolving credit facility 
for additional information regarding our financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities  see the risk factors the instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business set forth under item a risk factors

excess liquidity likely will continue to decrease while our industry and our company begins its recovery from this historic housing market downturn 
however  we believe that the amounts available from our revolving credit facilities and other sources will be sufficient to fund our routine operations and capital requirements for the next months 
in addition  we continue to take steps to reduce expenses and preserve cash for working capital 
notwithstanding these activities  if economic conditions  especially those related to the housing market  do not improve  we will need to seek additional sources of capital to support our operations 
the credit markets have experienced adverse conditions for the past few years  which may adversely affect our lenders ability to fulfill their commitment under our revolving credit facilities 
based on information available to us as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  we have no indications that the financial institutions included in our revolving credit facilities would be unable to fulfill their commitments 
we may elect to selectively pursue acquisitions

our cash requirements may significantly increase and incremental cash expenditures will be required in connection with the integration of the acquired company s business and to pay fees and expenses in connection with any acquisitions 
to the extent that significant amounts of cash are expended in connection with acquisitions  our liquidity position may be adversely impacted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing acquisitions in the future 
for a discussion of the risks associated with our acquisition strategy  see the risk factor integrating acquisitions may be time consuming and create costs that could reduce our net income and cash flows set forth under item a risk factors

the change in inventory is attributable to our continued focus on managing our inventory levels 
the increase in the current maturities of our long term debt relates primarily to upcoming principle payments on the mortgage 
we did not begin making principal payments on the mortgage until july of fiscal the decrease in cash is due to the movement discussed above coupled with our operating loss adjusted for non cash items 
these reductions were offset by an increase in other current assets of million primarily related to an increase in restricted cash from the sales of properties in the fourth quarter of fiscal and an increase in accounts receivable of million related to increased revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to fiscal as well as changes in customer mix affecting overall payment terms

on july   we reached an agreement with wells fargo bank  national association  successor by merger to wachovia bank  national association  and the other signatories to our existing us revolving credit facility  dated august   as amended  to amend the terms thereof 
this amendment extended the date of final maturity of the facility to january  and decreased the maximum availability under the agreement from million to million

under the amended us revolving credit facility agreement  the applicable percentage of the net liquidation value of our eligible inventory included in the calculation of the borrowing base is for the periods january to march and january to march  subject to specified ebitda targets 
the percentage of the net liquidation value of our eligible inventory included in the borrowing remains the same as under the original agreement outside of the time period just specified 
also included in the calculation of our excess availability is certain cash on the balance sheet  which is subject to a deposit account control agreement 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated as ebitda divided by the sum of cash payments for income taxes  interest expense  cash dividends  principal payments on debt  and capital expenditures 
ebitda is defined as bluelinx corporation s net income before interest and tax expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and other non cash charges 
the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement only applies to us when excess availability under our amended us revolving credit facility is less than the excess availability threshold on any date 
as of december  and through the time of the filing of this form k  we were in compliance with all covenants 
we had million and million of availability as of december  and january   respectively 
our lowest level of fiscal month end availability in the last three years as of december  was million 
we do not anticipate our excess availability in fiscal will drop below the excess availability threshold 
should our excess availability fall below the excess availability threshold on any date  however  we would not meet the required fixed charge coverage ratio covenant with our current operating results 
in addition  we must maintain a springing lock box arrangement where customer remittances go directly to a lock box maintained by our lenders and then are forwarded to our general bank accounts 
our outstanding borrowings are not reduced by these payments unless our excess availability falls below the greater of million or the amount equal to of the lesser of the borrowing base or million on any date or in the event of default 
our amended us revolving credit facility does not contain a subjective acceleration clause which would allow our lenders to accelerate the scheduled maturities of our debt or to cancel our agreement

this interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge 
during fiscal  our debt levels decreased below the interest rate swap notional  at which point the hedge became ineffective in offsetting future changes in expected cash flows during the remaining term of the interest rate swap

as of december   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our management believes that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any differences between these judgments and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and financial position 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that 
table of contents are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates include those regarding revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves  inventory valuation  fair value measurements  impairment of long lived assets  and income taxes 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated as fob free on board shipping point 
for sales transactions designated fob destination  revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer s delivery site 
all revenues are recorded at gross 
the key indicators used to determine when and how revenue is recorded are as follows we are the primary obligor responsible for fulfillment and all other aspects of the customer relationship 
title passes to bluelinx  and we carry all risk of loss related to warehouse  reload inventory and inventory shipped directly from vendors to our customers 
we are responsible for all product returns 
we control the selling price for all channels 
we select the supplier 
we bear all credit risk 
in addition  we provide inventory to certain customers through pre arranged agreements on a consignment basis 
customer consigned inventory is maintained and stored by certain customers  however  ownership and risk of loss remains with us 
when the inventory is sold by the customer  we recognize revenue on a gross basis 
all revenues recognized are net of trade allowances  cash discounts and sales returns 
cash discounts and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
trade allowances are based on the estimated obligations and historical experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on discounts and returns have been insignificant for each of the reported periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers and their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for each aging category on our aged trial balance based on our historical loss experience 
this estimate is periodically adjusted when we become aware of specific customers inability to meet their financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or other evidence of liquidity problems 
as we determine that specific balances will ultimately be uncollectible  we remove them from our aged trial balance 
additionally  we maintain reserves for cash discounts that we expect customers to earn as well as expected returns 
inventory valuation inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of all inventories is determined by the moving average cost method 
we include all charges directly or indirectly incurred in bringing inventory to its existing condition and location 
we evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that first quality  actively moving inventory  when viewed by category  is carried at the lower of cost or market 
additionally  we maintain a reserve for the estimated value impairment associated with damaged  excess and obsolete inventory 
the damaged  excess and obsolete reserve generally includes discontinued items or inventory that has turn days in excess of days  excluding new items during their product launch 

table of contents fair value measurements we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  which may affect our operating results and financial position 
when deemed appropriate  we minimize our risks from interest rate fluctuations through the use of an interest rate swap 
this derivative financial instrument is used to manage risk and is not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap  which terminated in march of  was valued using a valuation model that had inputs other than quoted market prices that were both observable and unobservable 
we endeavored to utilize the best available information in measuring the fair value of the interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap was classified in its entirety based on the lowest level of input that was significant to the fair value measurement 
to determine fair value of the interest rate swap we used the discounted estimated future cash flows methodology 
assumptions critical to our fair value were i the present value factors used in determining fair value ii projected libor  and iii the risk of counterparty non performance risk 
these and other assumptions were impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management 
we determined that the fair value of our interest rate swap was a level measurement in the fair value hierarchy as defined in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the level measurement is the risk of counterparty non performance on the interest rate swap liability that is not secured by cash collateral 
the affect of counterparty non performance was immaterial during fiscal and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives  are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we consider whether there were indicators of potential impairment on a quarterly basis 
indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses  management s decision to exit a facility  reductions in the fair market value of real properties and changes in other circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation of long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows  which is generally the individual distribution facility 
in the event of indicators of impairment  the assets of the distribution facility are evaluated by comparing the facility s undiscounted cash flows over the estimated useful life of the asset  which ranges between years  to its carrying value 
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the estimated fair market value 
impairment losses are recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
our estimate of undiscounted cash flows is subject to assumptions that affect estimated operating income at a distribution facility level 
these assumptions are related to future sales  margin growth rates  economic conditions  market competition and inflation 
in the event that undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of a facility  our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals and our experience with related market transactions 
we use a two year average of cash flows based on ebitda and projected ebitda  which includes a small growth factor assumption  to estimate undiscounted cash flows 
these assumptions used to determine impairment are considered to be level measurements in the fair value hierarchy as defined in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our operating results continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing downturn in the housing market 
to the extent that reductions in volume and operating income have resulted in impairment indicators  in all cases our carrying values continue to be less than our projected undiscounted cash flows 
as such  we have not identified significant known trends impacting the fair value of long lived assets to an extent that would indicate impairment 
during the first quarter of fiscal our newtown  ct facility was damaged due to severe winter weather 
as a result of the damage to the facility and its contents we have received approximately million in proceeds from the insurance company comprised of million related to the damaged building  million related to damaged and destroyed inventory and million related to the recovery of additional expenses incurred as a result of the damage 
cash received related to the damaged building was classified as an investing cash inflow in our consolidated statement of cash flows and used to reduce the principal of our mortgage 
all other cash inflows related to the insurance settlement were classified as operating cash flows in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
the majority of the remaining cash inflows were used to fund costs incurred related to the newtown loss 
we recognized a million gain in fiscal of which million related to the damaged building and million related to the recovery of gross margin on the inventory 
we recorded the gain at the time that the recovery of the minimum expected proceeds under our insurance policy became probable and was estimable 
this gain was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents income taxes the federal statutory income tax rate was 
our provision for benefit from income taxes is reconciled to the federal statutory amount as follows september  september  september  fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  in thousands benefit from income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rate benefit from state income taxes  net of federal benefit valuation allowance change other provision for benefit from income taxes our income before provision for income taxes for our canadian operations was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  we recognized tax expense of million 
the expense recognized for the year is primarily comprised of million for current state income tax expense related to earnings generated on a separate company basis and million of current income tax expense resulting from foreign income taxes 
for fiscal  we recognized tax benefit of million 
the benefit recognized for the year is primarily comprised of million of deferred income tax benefit resulting from the allocation of income tax expense to other comprehensive income  million of current income tax benefit resulting from a net operating loss carryback and million of current income tax expense resulting from foreign income taxes 
in accordance with the intraperiod tax allocation provisions of us gaap  we are required to consider all items including items recorded in other comprehensive income in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations that should be allocated to continuing operations 
in fiscal  there was no intraperiod tax allocation due to the fact that there was a loss in other comprehensive income for the period 
in fiscal  in addition to our federal income tax benefit  we recorded a non cash tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations of million  which was offset in full by income tax expense recorded in other comprehensive income 
while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported in our consolidated statements of operations  the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is a component of stockholders equity 
as of december   our deferred income tax assets were million  which are offset by a full valuation allowance 
deferred income tax assets and income tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
our financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of tax benefits associated with the loss before income taxes incurred during fiscal and fiscal  as well as net deferred income tax assets resulting from other temporary differences related to certain reserves  pension obligations and differences between book and tax depreciation and amortization 
we record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets when we determine that based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not our net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we considered the four sources of taxable income that should be considered when determining whether a valuation allowance is required including from least to most subjective taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the tax law  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 

table of contents in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating and non operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income 
substantial changes in these assumptions could result in changes in our judgments around our ability to realize future tax benefit 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb amended fair value measurement guidance to require a number of additional disclosures regarding fair value measurement  including the amount of transfers between levels and of the fair value hierarchy  the reasons for transfers in or out of level of the fair value hierarchy and activity for recurring level measures 
in addition the amendments clarify certain existing disclosure requirements related to the level at which fair value disclosures should be disaggregated  and the requirement to provide disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of assets or liabilities classified as levels or this guidance is effective for periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in level fair value measurements 
these disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
in may  the fasb issued guidance which amends existing us gaap fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to converge us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs requirements for measuring amounts at fair value as well as disclosures about these measurements 
this guidance is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not anticipate this guidance having a significant impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued guidance which eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the update also requires the presentation of a single statement of comprehensive income or consecutive presentation of the statement of income and the statement of comprehensive income  if a company elects to present two separate statements 
finally  reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income are required to be presented on the face of the financial statements 
there has been an amendment which defers the section of the new guidance related to the reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the new guidance and subsequent amendment are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  formal adoption of this guidance will not significantly impact our presentation of these items as we have historically presented the total of comprehensive loss  the components of net loss and the components of other comprehensive loss in a single continuous statement on the face of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
in september  the fasb issued guidance which provides the option of first assessing the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we had goodwill recorded and were completing an impairment analysis  this would allow us to skip the two step impairment test if it s determined not to be more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value 
we do not have goodwill recorded on the balance sheet and therefore this guidance does not currently impact us 
in september  the fasb issued guidance which requires quantitative and qualitative disclosures for multiemployer pension plans and current and future commitments 
these disclosures include providing additional information regarding the nature of the plan  level of participation in the multiemployer pension plan  the financial health of the plan  and the nature of commitments to the plan 
these disclosures are effective for annual periods for fiscal years ending after december  this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
we are exposed to risks such as changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we employ a variety of practices to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading  and are not used to address risks related to foreign currency exchange rates 
we record derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding our market risk exposure 

table of contents interest rates 
our revolving credit facilities accrue interest based on a floating benchmark rate the prime rate or libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
a change in interest rates under the revolving credit facility would have an impact on our results of operations 
however  a change of basis points in the market rate of interest would have an immaterial impact based on borrowings outstanding at december  additionally  to the extent changes in interest rates impact the housing market  we would be impacted by such changes 
we have a million mortgage loan with the german american capital corporation 
the mortgage has a term of ten years and a fixed interest rate of 
by entering into this fixed rate mortgage  we insulated ourselves from changes in market interest rates on a portion of our indebtedness 
this mortgage replaced our previously existing million floating rate mortgage  which had a interest rate when it was terminated 
foreign exchange rates 
less than of our net sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and we do not believe our total exposure to currency fluctuations to be significant 
commodity prices 
we believe that general inflation did not significantly affect our operating results or markets in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal as discussed above  our results of operations were both favorably and unfavorably impacted by increases and decreases in the pricing of certain commodity based products 
commodity price fluctuations have from time to time created cyclicality in our financial performance and may do so in the future
