overview we are a leading global provider of vertically integrated advanced design  manufacturing and services to original equipment manufacturers oems of a broad range of electronics products in the following markets high reliability solutions hrs  which is comprised of our medical  automotive  and defense and aerospace businesses  high velocity solutions hvs  which includes our mobile smart phone business  consumer electronics  including game consoles and printers  enterprise pc business and our odm personal computing business which we exited in the third quarter of fiscal  industrial and emerging industries iei  which is comprised of our industrial  semiconductor capital equipment and clean technology businesses  and integrated network solutions ins  which includes our telecommunications infrastructure  data networking  connected home  and server and storage businesses 
historically  our industry experienced significant change and growth as an increasing number of companies elected to outsource some or all of their design and manufacturing requirements 
we have seen an increase in the penetration of the global oem manufacturing requirements since the technology downturn as more and more oems pursued the benefits of outsourcing rather than internal manufacturing 
in the second half of fiscal  we experienced dramatically deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and demand for our customers products slowed in all of the industries we serve 
this global economic crisis  and related decline in demand for our customers products  put pressure on certain of our oem customers cost structures and caused them to reduce their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing requirements 
beginning in the second half of fiscal year  we began seeing some positive signs that demand for our oem customers end products was improving  and this trend continued through the end of our fiscal year 
we use a portfolio management approach to manage our extensive service offering 
as our oem customers change in the way they go to market  we reorganize and rebalance our business portfolio in order to align with our customers and to optimize our operating results 
as part of our portfolio management strategy  we expect to decrease the percentage of our revenue from our hvs businesses  which has lower margins  and increase the percentage of our revenue from our more complex and higher margin non hvs businesses 
our target is to achieve a mix whereby approximately of our revenue is derived from our non hvs businesses and of our revenue is derived from our hvs businesses 
we believe this is an optimal portfolio position for the company which will result in expanded margins  though resulting in lower overall revenue in the near term as we rebalance 
we continue to experience increased revenue in our non hvs markets through new business opportunities 
table of contents and have accelerated the reduction in our hvs market  a trend that we expect to continue in to fiscal we also expect to fully reposition assets and capacity in the hvs business in our non hvs businesses 
the objective of our operating model is to allow us to redeploy and reposition our assets and resources across all the markets we serve 
in may  due to negative operating margins and performance metrics on certain of our larger customer contracts  we announced that we would be phasing out of our odm personal computing pc business 
by the end of fiscal year we ceased all odm pc manufacturing operations and certain design activities of odm related businesses 
these businesses generated billion in sales and sustained operating losses of approximately million in fiscal we have redeployed the majority of the associated manufacturing and design assets into other parts of our business  which will benefit our future cash flows through reduced capital expenditure requirements 
additionally  as a result of the challenges faced by our camera modules business  this business has been performing at below optimal levels for the past several years 
on march   the company entered into a definitive agreement with tessera technologies  inc  and digitaloptics corporation doc  a wholly owned subsidiary of tessera technologies  in which doc will acquire certain assets of flextronics vista point technologies camera module business  including intellectual property and the china based manufacturing operations 
this transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal subject to certain closing conditions 
the results of operations and financial position of the divested camera modules business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented  and include a million charge in fiscal for the impairment of fixed assets to be disposed in the transaction based on the expected proceeds from the sale 
with respect to our remaining components businesses  our manufacturing efficiencies and production yields continued to improve and during fiscal year our component product solution services made progress reducing their aggregate operating losses 
we are encouraged by the increased demand for these product solutions and the successful achievement of acceptance in the market  and we remain intensely focused on further improving our manufacturing efficiencies and thus our future margins and profitability 
we are one of the world s largest manufacturing service providers  with revenues of billion in fiscal we design  build  ship  and service electronics products for our customers through a network of facilities in over countries across four continents 
we have established an extensive network of manufacturing facilities in the world s major electronics markets asia  the americas and europe in order to serve the growing outsourcing needs of both multinational and regional oems 
as of march   our total manufacturing capacity was approximately million square feet 
in fiscal  our net sales in asia  the americas and europe represented approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales  based on the location of the manufacturing site 
the following tables set forth net sales and net property and equipment  by country  based on the location of our manufacturing sites fiscal year ended march  net sales in thousands china mexico u 
s malaysia hungary other 
table of contents fiscal year ended march  property and equipment  net in thousands china mexico malaysia u 
s hungary other we believe that the combination of our extensive design and engineering services  significant scale and global presence  vertically integrated end to end services  advanced supply chain management  industrial campuses in low cost geographic areas and operational track record provide us with a competitive advantage in the market for designing  manufacturing and servicing electronics products for leading multinational and regional oems 
through these services and facilities  we offer our oem customers the ability to simplify their global product development  manufacturing process  and after sales services  and enable them to achieve meaningful time to market and cost savings 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors  including the following changes in the macroeconomic environment and related changes in consumer demand  the mix of the manufacturing services we are providing  the number and size of new manufacturing programs  the degree to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity  seasonal demand  shortages of components and other factors  the effects on our business when our customers are not successful in marketing their products  or when their products do not gain widespread commercial acceptance  our increased components offerings which have required that we make substantial investments in the resources necessary to design and develop these products  our ability to achieve commercially viable production yields and to manufacture components in commercial quantities to the performance specifications demanded by our oem customers  the effects on our business due to our customers products having short product life cycles  our customers ability to cancel or delay orders or change production quantities  our customers decision to choose internal manufacturing instead of outsourcing for their product requirements  our exposure to financially troubled customers  and integration of acquired businesses and facilities 
we also are subject to other risks as outlined in item a  risk factors 
net revenues for fiscal increased or billion to billion as we grew in all the major markets we serve except for hvs  which was impacted by decreased sales of mobile handsets to one of our significant customers as we rebalanced our portfolio and our planned exit of its odm pc business 
however  we believe that we finished the year in a healthy financial and competitive position driven in part by the success in our diversified business model 
the overall improvement in the macroeconomic environment during fiscal and the success in booking new product orders for our array of key customers led to increased demand for our oem customers end products 
the vast 
table of contents majority of our sales growth during the year was organic  as the impact from acquisitions was minimal 
our fiscal gross profit totaled billion  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to fiscal driven primarily by an increase in sales of low margin products in the odm personal computing business that we exited in the third quarter of fiscal our income from continuing operations of million was lower than the million realized in fiscal primarily reflecting the operating losses sustained from the odm personal computing business and the million we recognized for a financially distressed customer as discussed further below 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company identified certain accounting errors in the statutory to us gaap adjustments at one of its foreign sites that originated in prior interim and annual periods 
management conducted additional procedures and concluded that these errors were isolated to that location 
these errors  which primarily understated cost of sales  totaled million in the first nine months of fiscal and million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  and were corrected by the company as an out of period adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal this fourth quarter adjustment was partially offset by the correction of an error identified in the fourth quarter fiscal amounting to million related to the provisions for income taxes in the prior fiscal interim periods 
management believes the impact of these items  both individually and in the aggregate  to the fiscal year ended march  and to prior fiscal and interim periods presented was not material 
as a result of recording these adjustments in the fourth quarter  net income for the quarter and year ended march  were reduced by million per share and million per share  respectively 
subsequent to march   the company became aware that one of its customers in the concentrated solar photovoltaic market was experiencing significant financial and liquidity difficulties 
the company has been in good faith negotiations with the customer and its primary stakeholders on various out of court restructuring alternatives 
based on an evaluation of this customer s specific circumstances through may   including but not limited to  its financing alternatives  business prospects  proposed restructuring alternatives and the possibility of insolvency  the company determined that its best estimate was that all accounts receivable and inventory related to this customer were unrecoverable and recorded a charge of million as of march  related to this customer 
of this charge  the company classified million in cost of sales related to the write down of inventory and million as selling  general and administrative expenses for provisions for doubtful accounts 
based on all information available through march   the company believed that payment of receivables was reasonably assured at the time of shipment  and accordingly  the company recorded revenues on sales to the customer 
cash provided by operations decreased approximately million to million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year working capital increased million in fiscal primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts payable and to a lesser extent from an increase in accounts receivable 
our average net working capital  defined as accounts receivable plus the deferred purchase price receivable from our asset backed securitization programs plus inventory less accounts payable  as a percentage of annual sales was approximately  and for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage for the year ended march  is primarily attributable to the change in our overall portfolio as our mix of business shifted to a lesser percentage of hvs  which historically carries significantly higher inventory turns and customers with contractually faster payment terms 
our free cash flow  which we define as cash from operating activities less net purchases of property and equipment  was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to lesser cash flows from operations partially off set by lower capital expenditures as we continue to reposition assets from the odm personal computing business we exited in the december quarter 
cash used in financing activities amounted to million during fiscal and included repurchases of approximately million ordinary shares at an aggregate purchase price of million 

table of contents fiscal was a transformational year and one in which we took further steps to achieve a more diversified portfolio  as evidenced by our exit of the odm pc business 
we continue our focus on diversifying our product portfolio from the high volume low margin hvs market to other markets with a view to improving profitability and we expect these actions to take further effect over the course of fiscal we believe that this diversified portfolio provides our investors with a more stable and predictable portfolio with longer product lifecycles 
we believe that the long term  future growth prospects for outsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities  design and engineering services and after market services are and will remain strong 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap or gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements
