richards  our office products group office  were billion in  up from office revenues began to stabilize in relative to prior year trends  and this group was able to make further progress in we were pleased to report growth for this business  despite the ongoing difficult environment for the office products industry  which we attribute to the generally slow recovery of white collar employment levels in the us sales increased approximately  and in the first  second and third quarters  respectively  and were down in the fourth quarter of net sales for office were billion in  up slightly compared to the prior year 
office revenues stabilized in  although the office products industry continued to experience soft market conditions throughout the year as a result of reduced business spending and the ongoing impact of elevated unemployment levels 
sales decreased approximately in the first and second quarters  were flat in the third quarter and were up by in the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter increase was significant  as the industry wide slowdown in office products consumption had pressured this group for several years and the fourth quarter of marked the first positive sales comparison for office since the second quarter of electrical group net sales for eis  our electrical and electronic group electrical  increased to million in  up from our sales initiatives and the continued manufacturing expansion during the year  as measured by the institute for supply management s purchasing managers index  were the primary sales drivers in in addition  acquisitions in contributed approximately to electrical s sales growth  and the effect of copper pricing had a positive sales impact for the year 
electrical sales increased by in the first quarter  and this was followed by increases of in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
net sales for electrical increased to million in  up from electrical sales increased by in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter

the increase in cost of goods sold from to is directly related to the sales increase for the same period 
cost of goods sold represented of net sales in  of net sales in and of net sales in the increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for and relative to reflects the impact of certain pricing adjustments implemented in automotive as well as ongoing competitive pricing pressures in industrial and office 
these factors more than offset our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies  promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs  hence the lower gross margin levels over the last two years 
in  all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases for the second consecutive year  although  in  the automotive and office increases were relatively immaterial 
in  our office and electrical business segments experienced vendor price increases  while industrial was flat and automotive pricing was down for the year 
in any year where we experience price increases  we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them

office group office s operating margin decreased slightly to in from in the decrease in operating margin in primarily reflects the continued pressures on gross margin in this industry  due to the slower pace of the economic recovery and office employment 
these pressures were partially offset by the positive impact of office s cost savings initiatives 
office s operating margin increased to in from in and reflects the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives combined with the benefit of higher volume incentives from suppliers 
the increase in incentives was due to our fourth quarter sales growth and related increase in purchase volumes  which allowed us to achieve higher program growth tiers with suppliers 
electrical group electrical s operating margin increased to in from in the increase in operating margin in is due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a sales increase  its second straight year of strong double digit sales growth  and the ongoing benefits of effective cost controls

electrical s operating margin decreased to in from in the decrease in operating margin was mainly due to escalating copper prices during the year  which generally do not affect profit dollars  but negatively impact margins as copper is generally billed to customers at cost 
the margin pressures associated with this industry standard pricing practice for copper more than offset the benefits of a stronger manufacturing sector in and greater expense leverage associated with a sales increase

goodwill and other intangible assets increased by million or from december  due to the company s acquisitions during the year 
the change in our december  balances for deferred taxes  up million or  as well as pension and other post retirement benefits liabilities  up million or approximately from december   is primarily due to a change in funded status of the company s pension and other post retirement plans in  net of million in pension contributions during the year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations  supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings 
we have million of total debt outstanding at december   of which million matures in november and million matures in november in addition  the company has available a million unsecured revolving line of credit 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at december  and the capital and credit markets were volatile over the last few years  although these conditions did not materially impact our access to these markets 
currently  we believe that our cash on hand and available short term and long term sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company s operations  including working capital requirements  scheduled debt payments  interest payments  capital expenditures  benefit plan contributions  income tax obligations  dividends  share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december   and this compares to to at december  before consideration of current debt outstanding at december   the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to our liquidity position remains solid

contractual and other obligations the following table shows the company s approximate obligations and commitments  including interest due on credit facilities  to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payment due by period total less than year years years over years in thousands credit facilities operating leases total contractual cash obligations due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company s unrecognized tax benefits at december   the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates 
the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company s guarantee 
to date  the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents and affiliates borrowings 
the following table shows the company s approximate commercial commitments as of december  other commercial commitments total amounts committed amount of commitment expiration per period less than year years years over years in thousands line of credit standby letters of credit guaranteed borrowings of independents and affiliates total commercial commitments in addition  the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
contributions in were million 
we expect to make a million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in  and contributions required for and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations 
share repurchases in  the company repurchased approximately million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately million shares at december  critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
for further information on the critical accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
inventories provisions for slow moving and obsolescence the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs 
while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future  its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
initially  the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience 
this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed  a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and  therefore  the need to revise estimates for bad debts 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million  and million  respectively 
consideration received from vendors the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives 
generally  the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria 
the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year 
while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in and beyond  there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 
impairment of property  plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually  the company evaluates property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
the company s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance  among other factors 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
employee benefit plans the company s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company s pension plan assets 
the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company s management is to achieve long term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada  as well as fiduciary standards 
the long term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk  protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan s actuarially assumed long term rate of return 
the company s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark s p index  russell mid cap index  russell index  msci eafe index  and barcap us govt credit 
we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense 
we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 
other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases  mortality rates  retirement patterns and turnover rates 
based on the investment policy for the pension plans  as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company s asset allocations and future expectations  the company s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring pension expense or income is for the plans 
the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company s benefit obligations  using capital market data and historical relationships 
the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date 
we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate 
based upon this cash flow matching analysis  we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of at december  net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in pension cost in from reflects the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases 
the increase in pension cost in from was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent remeasurement of the us defined benefit pension plan in and the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases 
the curtailment and subsequent remeasurement decreased benefit costs in and are discussed further below 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 
in april  the company recorded a million non cash curtailment adjustment in connection with a plan reorganization  which reduced the expected years of future service of employees covered by the us defined benefit pension plan 
in july  the company announced changes to the us postretirement benefit plan 
effective january   future retirees no longer receive employer provided medical benefits and current pre retirees no longer receive employer provided post benefits beyond an access only arrangement 
quarterly results of operations the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and three months ended march  june  sept 
 dec 
 in thousands except per share data net sales gross profit net income earnings per share basic diluted net sales gross profit net income earnings per share basic diluted we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period 
as a result  the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 
the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements 
specifically  the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts  inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned  among others 
bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales  and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels 
inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual september and october book to physical inventory adjustments 
the methodology and practices used in deriving estimates and assumptions for interim reporting typically result in adjustments upon accurate determination at year end 
the effect of these adjustments in and was not significant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although the company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices  the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
foreign currency the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes 
the company s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar  which is the functional currency of our canadian operations 
foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian dollar and  to a lesser extent  the mexican peso  positively impacted our results for the year ended december  during and  it was estimated that a shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately million and million  respectively
