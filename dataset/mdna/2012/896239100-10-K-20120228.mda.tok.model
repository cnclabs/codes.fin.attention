executive level overview trimble s focus is on combining positioning technology with wireless communication and application capabilities to create system level solutions that enhance productivity and accuracy for our customers 
the majority of our markets are end user markets  including engineering and construction firms  governmental organizations  public safety workers  farmers  and companies who must manage fleets of mobile workers and assets 
we also provide components to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their products 
in the end user markets  we provide a system that includes a hardware platform that may contain software and customer support 
some examples of our solutions include products that automate and simplify the process of surveying land  products that automate the utilization of equipment such as tractors and bulldozers  products that enable a company to manage its mobile workforce and assets  and products that allow municipalities to manage their fixed assets 
in addition  we also provide software applications on a stand alone basis 
for example  we provide software for project management on construction sites 
to achieve distribution  marketing  production  and technology advantages in our targeted markets  we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction  field solutions  mobile solutions  and advanced devices 
solutions targeted at the end user make up a significant majority of our revenue 
to create compelling products  we must attain an understanding of the end users needs and work flow  and how location based technology can enable that end user to work faster  more efficiently  and more accurately 
we use this knowledge to create highly innovative products that change the way work is done by the end user 
with the exception of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments  our products are generally sold through a dealer channel  and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient  global  third party distribution channel 
we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in three categories 
reinforcing our position in existing markets we believe these markets continue to be underpenetrated and provide us with additional  substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods 
we are continuing to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels in order to expand our market

our efforts also continue to be focused in africa  china  india  the middle east  russia  and south america 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we elected to early adopt new revenue accounting guidance related to arrangements with multiple deliverables at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after fiscal we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
contracts and or customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses  as well as the customer s payment history 
revenue for orders is generally not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer 
we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point 
our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point 
if no precise point is indicated by the buyer  delivery is deemed to occur when the carrier takes the goods into its charge from the place determined by us 
other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
revenue from sales to distributors and resellers is recognized upon shipment  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 
revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support pcs agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period 
we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 
our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs 
we generally have established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate 
the 
table of contents remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method 
license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements 
some of our subscription product offerings include hardware  subscription services and extended warranty 
under our hosted arrangements  the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a third party s hardware 
upfront fees related to our hosted solutions typically consist of amounts for the in vehicle enabling hardware device and peripherals 
our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware  extended warranty and pcs services  which are considered separate units of accounting 
for certain of our products  software and non software components function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality 
in evaluating the revenue recognition for agreements which contain multiple deliverable arrangements  under the new accounting guidance  we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis  did not price products within a narrow range  or had a limited sales history 
when vsoe cannot be established  we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant third party evidence tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of competitors  and offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology  customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
therefore  we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use our best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  geographies and gross margin 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management  taking into consideration our go to market strategy 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserve  was million at the end of fiscal  as compared with million at the end of fiscal the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
we evaluate ongoing collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances  credit quality  historical experience  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
inventory valuation our inventories  net balance were million at the end of fiscal as compared with million at the end of fiscal our inventory allowances at the end of fiscal were million  as compared with million at the end of fiscal our inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which 
table of contents approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  are made for estimated excess  or obsolescence balances 
factors influencing these adjustments include decline in demand  technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration  and quality issues 
if actual factors are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 
relative to uncertain tax positions  we only recognize the tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our practice is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to acquired net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards 
management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets  and  accordingly  a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts 
valuation allowance adjustments associated with an acquisition after the measurement period are recorded through income tax expense 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
intangible assets acquired individually  with a group of other assets  or in a business combination  are recorded at fair value 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights  patents  licenses  technology  acquired backlog  trademarks  and in process research and development 
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight line method  reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets  and have estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years with a weighted average useful life of years 
goodwill is not subject to amortization  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment  applying a fair value based test 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a two step process 
first  impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in step two  the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
at the end of fiscal  for each reporting unit  our estimated fair values exceeded the carry values by substantial margins 
depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these 
table of contents assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model  or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other long lived assets differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised  the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value we will depreciate over its revised remaining useful life 
these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 
warranty costs the liability for product warranties was million at the end of fiscal  as compared with million at the end of fiscal we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs  technical support labor costs  and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf 
our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from days to three years  and in some instances  up to years 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the grate date fair value for options is estimated using a binomial valuation model 
the fair value of rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
in addition  the binomial model incorporates actual option pricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option s contractual term 
we base the expected stock price volatility for stock purchase rights on implied volatilities of traded options on our stock and our expected stock price volatility for stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock price volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option and the implied volatility of traded options 
the use of implied volatilities was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock with terms similar to our awards and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
however  because the expected life of our stock options is greater than the terms of our traded options  we used a combination of our historical stock price volatility commensurate with the expected life of our stock options and implied volatility of traded options 
we estimated the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 

table of contents we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our expected dividend yield is zero 
because stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal  and is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the stock based compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our share based payment awards granted in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  valuation models  including the black scholes and binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination  or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements

in the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products  we indemnify other parties  including customers  lessors  and parties to other transactions with us  with respect to certain matters 
we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants  or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties 
these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  together with our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs  debt service  planned capital expenditures  and stock purchases under the stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents we anticipate that planned capital expenditures primarily for the building of a facility in westminster  colorado expected to begin in  as well as computer equipment  software  manufacturing tools and test equipment  and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion  will constitute a partial use of our cash resources 
decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the increase of million was due to an increase in net income before non cash depreciation and amortization  primarily attributable to engineering and construction and field solutions segments increased revenue  offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenue from engineering and construction and field solutions segments  additionally  fiscal included the payment of income taxes payable associated with the irs tax settlement which is not applicable in fiscal cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the decrease of million was driven by an increase in inventory spending  a million payment associated with an irs settlement  partially offset by an increase in net income before non cash depreciation and amortization  accounts payable  and accrued compensation and benefits 
the increase in inventories during fiscal was primarily attributable to our engineering and construction segment and was due to an increase in revenue 
investing activities cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the increase of million was primarily due to higher cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions in fiscal  with the largest cash requirement due to the tekla acquisition 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the increase of million was primarily due to higher cash used for business and intangible asset acquisitions in fiscal financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  as compared to cash used of million during fiscal the increase of million was primarily due to proceeds from long term debt and revolving credit lines for business acquisitions  an increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises  the repurchase of common stock during fiscal  offset by payments on long term debt and debt issuance costs during fiscal cash used by financing activities was million for fiscal  as compared to cash provided of million during fiscal the decrease of million was primarily due to the stock repurchases in the first nine months of fiscal  partially offset by common stock issued upon the exercise of stock options 
accounts receivable and inventory metrics at the end of fiscal year accounts receivable days sales outstanding inventory turns per year accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down at days at the end of fiscal  as compared to days at the end of fiscal our accounts receivable days sales outstanding are calculated based on ending 
table of contents accounts receivable  net  divided by revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter  times a quarterly average of days 
our inventory turns were both at the end of fiscal and our inventory turnover is based on the total cost of sales for the fiscal period over the average inventory for the corresponding fiscal period 
repatriation of foreign earnings and income taxes a significant portion of our foreign earnings continue to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries  and it is anticipated this reinvestment will not impede cash needs at the parent company level 
in our determination of which foreign earnings are permanently reinvested  we consider numerous factors  including the financial requirements of the us parent company  the financial requirements of the foreign subsidiaries  and the tax consequences of remitting the foreign earnings back to the us there are no other material impediments to our ability to access sources of liquidity and our resulting ability to meet short and long term liquidity needs  other than in the event we are not in compliance with the covenants under our credit facility or the tax costs of remitting foreign earnings back to the us debt on may   we entered into a new credit agreement  or credit facility  with a group of lenders 
this credit facility provides for unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of billion  comprised of a five year revolving loan facility of million and a five year million term loan facility 
subject to the terms of the credit facility  the revolving loan facility and the term loan facility may be increased by up to million in the aggregate but we may no longer draw down on the term loan facility 
additionally  on july   we entered into a million uncommitted revolving loan facility  which we call our uncommitted facility 
this facility is callable by the bank at any time and has no covenants 
the interest rate on the uncommitted facility is plus either libor  or the bank s cost of funds or as otherwise agreed upon by the bank and us 
at the end of fiscal  our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of million and a revolving credit line of million under the credit facility and a revolving credit line of million under the uncommitted facility 
of the total outstanding balance  million of the term loan and million of the revolving credit line are classified as long term in the consolidated balance sheet 
at the end of fiscal  we had promissory notes and other notes payable totaling approximately million consisted primarily of notes payable of million to noncontrolling interest holders of one of our consolidated subsidiaries 
the notes bear interest at and have undefined payment terms  but are callable with a six month notification 
for additional discussion of our debt  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the funds available under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes  the financing of acquisitions and the payment of transaction fees and expenses related to such acquisitions 
under the credit facility  we may borrow  repay and reborrow funds under the revolving loan facility until its maturity on may   at which time the revolving facility will terminate  and all outstanding loans  together with all accrued and unpaid interest  must be repaid 
amounts not borrowed under the revolving facility will be subject to a commitment fee  to be paid in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter  ranging from to per annum depending on our leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter 
the term loan will be repaid in quarterly installments  with the last quarterly payment to be made at april  on an annualized basis  the amortization of the term loan is as follows     and for years one through five respectively 
the term loan may be prepaid in whole or in part  subject to certain minimum thresholds  without penalty or premium

our obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by several of our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains various customary representations and warranties by us 
the credit facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including  among other requirements  negative covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets  create liens  incur indebtedness  repurchase stock  pay dividends  make acquisitions and make investments 
further  the credit facility contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios 
specifically  we must maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of a ebitda as defined in the credit facility to b interest expenses for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not less than to we must also maintain  at the end of each fiscal quarter  a ratio of x total indebtedness to y ebitda as defined in the credit facility for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters of not greater than the applicable ratio set forth in the table below  provided  that on the completion of a material acquisition  we may increase the applicable ratio in the table below by for the fiscal quarter during which such acquisition occurred and each of the three subsequent fiscal quarters 
fiscal quarter ending maximum leverage ratio prior to march  to on and after march  and prior to june  to on and after june  to we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants at the end of fiscal the credit facility contains events of default that include  among others  non payment of principal  interest or fees  breach of covenants  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  cross defaults to certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency events  material judgments  and events constituting a change of control 
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default  interest on the obligations will accrue at an increased rate and the lenders may accelerate our obligations under the credit facility  however that acceleration will be automatic in the case of bankruptcy and insolvency events of default 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands principal payments on debt interest payments on debt operating leases other purchase obligations and commitments total amount represents principal payments over the life of the debt obligations

interest was estimated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
interest was estimated to be per annum  based upon recent trends  and is not included in our consolidated balance sheets 
other purchase obligations and commitments primarily represent open non cancelable purchase orders for material purchases with our vendors  and also include estimated payments due for acquisition related earn outs and holdbacks 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
at the end of fiscal we had unrecognized tax benefits included in other non current liabilities of million  including interest and penalties 
at this time  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability  and therefore  such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above

reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures our non gaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures 
the non gaap financial measures included in the following table are set forth below non gaap gross margin we believe our investors benefit by understanding our non gaap gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix  pricing decisions and manufacturing costs influence our business 
non gaap gross margin excludes restructuring costs  amortization of purchased intangibles  stock based compensation and amortization of acquisition related inventory step up from gaap gross margin 
we believe that these exclusions offer investors additional information that may be useful to view trends in our gross margin performance 
non gaap operating expenses we believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our non gaap spending in relation to revenue 
non gaap operating expenses exclude restructuring costs  amortization of purchased intangibles  stock based compensation and acquisition costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal  due diligence and integration costs from gaap operating expenses 
we believe that these exclusions offer investors supplemental information to facilitate comparison of our operating expenses to our prior results 
non gaap operating income we believe our investors benefit by understanding our non gaap operating income trends which are driven by revenue  gross margin  and spending 
non gaap operating income excludes restructuring costs  amortization of purchased intangibles  stock based compensation  amortization of acquisition related inventory step up and acquisition costs associated with external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal  due diligence and integration costs 
we believe that these exclusions offer an alternative means for our investors to evaluate current operating performance compared to results of other periods 
non gaap non operating income  net we believe this measure helps investors evaluate our non operating income trends 
non gaap non operating income  net excludes acquisition gains or costs associated with unusual acquisition related items such as a gain 
table of contents on bargain purchase resulting from the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired exceeding the consideration transferred  adjustments to the fair value of earn out liabilities and payments made or received to settle earn out and holdback disputes 
these costs are specific to particular acquisitions and vary significantly in amount and timing 
non gaap non operating income  net also excludes the write off of debt issuance costs associated with a terminated credit facility as well as a foreign exchange gain specifically associated with two of our larger acquisitions 
we believe that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of our ongoing financial results 
non gaap income tax provision investors benefit from the exclusion of an irs settlement because it facilitates comparisons to our past income tax provision 
non gaap income tax provision excludes an irs settlement and a valuation allowance release from gaap income tax provision and includes non gaap items tax effected 
non gaap items tax effected adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of certain non gaap items on non gaap net income 
we believe this information is useful to investors because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in our non gaap presentation 
non gaap net income this measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends which are driven by non gaap income before taxes and our non gaap tax rate 
non gaap net income excludes restructuring costs  amortization of purchased intangibles  stock based compensation  amortization of acquisition related inventory step up  acquisition costs  the write off of debt issuance costs  a foreign exchange gain associated with two of our larger acquisitions  and non gaap tax adjustments from gaap net income 
we believe our investors benefit from understanding these exclusions and from an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to our past net income performance 
non gaap diluted net income per share we believe our investors benefit by understanding our non gaap operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring non gaap operating performance by ownership in the company 
non gaap diluted net income per share excludes restructuring costs  amortization of purchased intangibles  stock based compensation  amortization of acquisition related inventory step up  acquisition costs  the write off of debt issuance costs  a foreign exchange gain associated with two acquisitions  and non gaap tax adjustments from gaap diluted net income per share 
we believe that these exclusions offer investors a useful view of our diluted net income per share as compared to our past diluted net income per share 
non gaap operating leverage we believe this information is beneficial to investors as a measure of how much incremental revenue is contributed to our operating income 
non gaap operating leverage is the increase in non gaap operating income as a percentage of the increase in revenue 
we believe that this information offers investors supplemental information to evaluate our current performance and to compare to our past non gaap operating leverage 
non gaap segment operating income non gaap segment operating income excludes stock based compensation from gaap segment operating income 
we believe this information is useful to investors because some may exclude stock based compensation as an alternative view when assessing trends in the operating income of our segments 

table of contents these non gaap measures can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance  as well as our performance relative to competitors 
we believe some of our investors track our core operating performance as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary  ongoing  and customary course of our operations 
core operating performance excludes items that are non cash  not expected to recur or not reflective of ongoing financial results 
management also believes that looking at our core operating performance provides a supplemental way to provide consistency in period to period comparisons 
accordingly  management excludes from non gaap those items relating to restructuring  amortization of purchased intangibles  stock based compensation  amortization of acquisition related inventory step up  acquisition costs  the write off of debt issuance costs  a foreign exchange gain associated with two acquisitions  and certain tax charges benefits of which million is associated with the irs settlement and million is associated with valuation allowance release benefit

restructuring 
included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses  restructuring costs recorded are primarily for employee compensation resulting from reductions in employee headcount in connection with our company restructurings 
we exclude restructuring costs from our non gaap measures because we believe they do not reflect expected future operating expenses  they are not indicative of our core operating performance  and they are not meaningful in comparisons to our past operating performance 
b 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
included in our gaap presentation of gross margin  operating expenses  operating income  and net income is amortization of purchased intangibles 
us gaap accounting requires that intangible assets are recorded at fair value and amortized over their useful lives 
consequently  the timing and size of our acquisitions will cause our operating results to vary from period to period making a comparison to past performance difficult for investors 
this accounting treatment may cause differences when comparing our results to companies that grow internally because the fair value assigned to the intangible assets acquired through acquisition may significantly exceed the equivalent expenses that a company may incur for similar efforts when performed internally 
furthermore  the useful life that we expense our intangible assets over may be substantially different from the time period that an internal growth company incurs and recognizes such expenses 
we believe that by excluding purchased intangibles which primarily represents technology and or customer relationships already developed  it enhances comparability by allowing investors to compare our operations pre acquisition to those post acquisitions and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies 

table of contents c 
stock based compensation 
included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses  stock based compensation consists of expenses for employee stock options and awards and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan 
we exclude stock based compensation expense from our non gaap measures because some investors may view it as not reflective of our core operating performance as it is a non cash expense 
for fiscal years  and  stock based compensation was allocated as follows fiscal years in thousands cost of sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative d 
amortization of acquisition related inventory step up 
the purchase accounting entries associated with our business acquisitions require us to record inventory at its fair value  which is sometimes greater than the previous book value of the inventory 
included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales  the increase in inventory value is amortized to cost of sales over the period that the related product is sold 
we exclude inventory step up amortization from our non gaap measures because it is a non cash expense that we do not believe is indicative of our ongoing operating results 
we further believe that excluding this item from our non gaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for period over period comparability 
e 
acquisition costs 
included in our gaap presentation of operating expenses  acquisition costs consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal  due diligence and integration costs 
included in our gaap presentation of non operating income  net  acquisition gain includes unusual acquisition related items such as a gain on bargain purchase resulting from the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired exceeding the consideration transferred  adjustments to the fair value of earn out liabilities and payments made or received to settle earn out and holdback disputes 
although we do numerous acquisitions  the costs that have been excluded from the non gaap measures are costs specific to particular acquisitions 
these are one time costs that vary significantly in amount and timing and are not indicative of our core operating performance 
f 
debt issuance cost write off 
included in our non operating income  net this amount represents a write off of debt issuance cost for a terminated credit facility 
we excluded the debt issuance cost write off from our non gaap measures 
we believe that investors benefit from excluding this item from our non operating income to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our non operating income trends 
g 
foreign exchange gain associated with acquisitions 
this amount represents the net gain on foreign exchange hedges associated with two of our larger acquisitions 
we excluded the foreign exchange from our non gaap measures because we believe that the exclusion of this item provides investors an enhanced view of the cost structure of our operations and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods 
h 
non gaap items tax effected 
this amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the non gaap items a g on non gaap net income 
we believe this information is useful to investors because it provides for consistent treatment of the excluded items in this non gaap presentation 
i 
irs settlement 
this amount represents a net charge of million in the second quarter of resulting from the irs audit settlement 
we excluded this because it is not indicative of our future operating results 
we believe that investors benefit from excluding this charge from our operating results to facilitate comparisons to past operating performance 
j 
valuation allowance release 
this amount represents a benefit of million in the fourth quarter of resulting from a valuation allowance release 
we excluded this from our non gaap results to enhance comparability of results across periods 
k 
gaap and non gaap tax rate 
these percentages are defined as gaap income tax provision as a percentage of gaap income before taxes and non gaap income tax provision as a percentage of non gaap income before taxes 
we believe that investors benefit from a presentation of non gaap tax rate percentage as a way of facilitating a comparison to non gaap tax rates in prior periods 
l 
stock based compensation 
the amounts consist of expenses for employee stock options and awards and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan 
as referred to above we exclude stock based compensation here because investors may view it as not reflective of our core operating performance as it is a non cash expense 
however  management does include stock based compensation for budgeting and incentive plans as well as for reviewing internal financial reporting 
we discuss our operating results by segment with and without stock based compensation expense  as we believe it is useful to investors 
stock based compensation not allocated to the reportable segments was approximately million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 

table of contents non gaap operating income non gaap operating income increased by million for fiscal as compared to fiscal  and increased by million for fiscal as compared to fiscal non gaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in operating income and operating income percentage during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated operating leverage in engineering and construction and field solutions 
the increase in operating income and operating income percentage during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated operating leverage in engineering and construction and field solutions  partially offset by mobile solutions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 
market interest rate risk our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds  treasury bills  interest and non interest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits 
the main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return  without significantly increasing risk 
due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents  we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities 
our credit facility is comprised of an unsecured term loan and a revolving credit agreement with maturity dates of may  and also an unsecured uncommitted revolving credit agreement that is callable by the bank at any time 
we may borrow funds these facilities in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at the end of fiscal  our total debt was comprised primarily of a term loan of million and a revolving credit line of million under the credit facility and a revolving credit line of million under the uncommitted facility 
a hypothetical increase in the one month libor rates could result in approximately  annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future 
furthermore  the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time 
as a result  actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate in international markets  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which is the euro 
historically  the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars  with the most significant exception being europe  where we invoice primarily in euros 
additionally  a portion of our operating expenses  primarily the cost to manufacture  cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional 
table of contents services  sales and sales support and research and development  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  swedish krona  new zealand dollar and canadian dollar 
revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income 
as exchange rates vary  operating income may differ from expectations 
in fiscal and  the impact to operating income was immaterial 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on cash  certain trade and inter company receivables and payables  primarily denominated in australian  canadian and new zealand dollars  japanese yen  indian rupee  south african rand  swedish krona  euro  and british pound 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts 
these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 
we occasionally enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions 
foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at the end of fiscal and are summarized as follows in thousands at the end of fiscal at the end of fiscal nominal amount fair value nominal amount fair value forward contracts purchased sold we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy
