item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion addresses the principal factors affecting the company s financial condition and operations during the past three years and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the five year financial summary found in item and item of this report 
overview the company is a diversified communications company located primarily in the southeastern united states 
it is focused on providing high quality local content in growth markets over multiple platforms and continuing to develop new products and initiatives tailored to customer preferences 
the company values traditional media audience viewership  but also understands the importance of garnering an increased share of digital audiences and monetizing online and mobile content 
regardless of the delivery platform  content and information remain the primary products that the company provides 
each marketplace has its own specific needs  which are being addressed through a variety of targeted means  including niche publications  digital subscriptions for online content  customized broadcast programs and segments  centralized content resulting from pooled resources within a region  and additional newscasts that resulted from partnering with other affiliates and tv stations 
by focusing on specific opportunities within a geographic market  the company remains close to its customers advertisers and consumers and as a result  its products evolve to meet the needs of the marketplace 
the company s strategic objective is to drive profitable growth across multiple platforms by engaging with communities on their own terms and by developing effective marketing opportunities that connect advertisers to their prospective targeted customers 
the company continues to build upon this digital first approach to news reporting and content gathering  leveraging mobile and the internet as the immediate platforms for distribution of breaking news and positioning digital media in each of its markets for strong  long term audience growth 
the company has expanded certain key strategic partnerships with yahoo and zillow to include its television markets 
in early  the company transitioned from yahoo hot jobs and began selling recruitment advertising co branded with monster 
the company has also forged partnerships with several other fast growing online businesses in the shopping  coupon  mobile and social media categories 
these relationships with both emerging and established online brands present promising new revenue growth opportunities 
additionally  the company is a founding member of a group of local and national broadcasters that are working to develop a mobile dtv model including content and technology 
over time  this technology has the potential to expand the company s broadcast audience and provide new revenue streams from both subscription packages and advertising 
a component of accelerating the company s digital strategy includes a renewed focus on regaining a larger share of classified advertising by exploiting all relationships and platforms available and utilizing all of its resources in tandem while making continued progress towards that goal 
the company recently joined forces with the associated press and other news organizations to launch a company that will monetize the currently unpaid online use of their original content by converting unauthorized websites  blogs and other newsgathering services into licensed paying customers 
the years through were laden with economic turmoil 
in  the economic climate remained daunting with only small signs of recovery as the year progressed 
the economy in could be described as precariously stabilized  but this was in comparison to several tumultuous prior years 
the sputtering economy continued into  and many companies  and particularly those in the media industry  were directly impacted by reduced consumer confidence and lower advertiser spending levels 
the company s florida market was the first and most significantly affected of the company s markets  as a housing induced recession in florida which began in late served as an indicator of what was to follow throughout the country  unfortunately  the company s other markets ultimately felt the economic reverberations 
while most markets have begun to moderate  if not recover  the florida market has been slow to rebound as real estate values continue to struggle due to a high level of foreclosure activity 
over the past five years  the company has heeded the economic indicators and has responded with aggressive cost reductions 
these cost reductions included a major restructuring at the tampa tribune and its associated print operations toward the end of  which resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately of employees at the company s print and online operations in tampa 
through substantial cost reductions and by capturing new synergies across the multiple newsrooms and bureaus that produce the various print publications and tbo 
com content  the company expects a markedly improved financial performance within the florida market as the newspaper s cost structure now better aligns with its current revenue expectations 
advertising sales comprise the majority of the company s revenues 
the distribution of advertising revenues in the united states continues to shift among numerous established media  as well as many relatively new contenders  
table of contents resulting in intense competition 
the company faces challenges from increasing digital competition  from structural changes in industries that have historically been major purchasers of print advertising  from cautious advertisers  and from the cyclical nature of certain advertising which translates into the relative absence of political and olympics advertising for television stations in odd numbered years 
the company recognizes that it is part of an industry in transition  particularly regarding the packaging and delivery of information 
while the company is aware of the pace and depth of an underlying shift away from traditional print advertising  it also recognizes that this migration presents numerous potential revenue streams and prospective new customers 
the role of digital media continues to evolve at a rapid pace  and the company believes it is well positioned both strategically and structurally to capitalize on the emerging opportunities 
certain pending climate change and other environmental laws and regulations could impact the company if enacted or adopted by potentially increasing its operating costs through higher electricity and other expenses associated with its facilities and  possibly  by increasing the cost of newsprint  the company s most significant raw material 
climate change effects could include more intense tropical storms  tornadoes and hurricanes potentially causing lost revenue and higher expenses associated with storms because of the concentration of the company s operations in the southeastern united states  as discussed in item a of this form k 
on march   the company amended its existing bank credit agreement 
the amendments include covenant modifications that provide the company more flexibility to operate in the current uncertain economic environment 
additionally  the amended agreement provides for an extension of the maturity date of the million of bank debt from march to march if certain criteria are met 
the trigger for this extension will be raising at least million prior to may  to prepay a portion of the outstanding term loan and to establish certain liquidity reserves 
the terms of the agreement permit the incurrence of additional debt financing to fund the prepayment and liquidity reserves 
for a more detailed discussion surrounding this amendment  see the liquidity section of this management s discussion analysis md a 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires that management make various estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses reported 
the company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if that estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and if changes in the estimate which are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the audit committee of the board of directors has reviewed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates 
while actual results could differ from accounting estimates  the company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas intangible assets the company reviews the carrying values of both goodwill and other identified intangible assets  including fcc licenses  as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year  or earlier if events indicate an impairment may have arisen  utilizing discounted cash flow models and market based models 
the preparation of discounted cash flow models requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue growth  compensation levels  newsprint prices  capital expenditures  discount rates and long term growth rates for broadcast and newspaper assets 
the preparation of market based models requires the collection of estimated peer company data as to revenues and ebitda  as well as an assessment of enterprise values by looking at stock prices and debt levels 
these key assumptions for both the discounted cash flow and market based models work in concert with one another 
changes to one variable may necessitate changes to other variables 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level 
all reporting units are one level below the operating segment  with the exception of the florida and ohio rhode island markets which are operating segments 
the company early adopted asu  intangibles goodwill and other  and applied the guidance when it conducted its annual impairment testing as of the first day of the fourth quarter in this standard allows companies the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
as a result  impairment testing for three reporting units  principally broadcast reporting units  was not required 
all other reporting units were tested on an interim basis in august and or annually in september as described below 

table of contents as a result of a third quarter interim impairment test  there was a partial write off of goodwill at one reporting unit within the virginia tennessee market which reduced its carrying value by a substantial margin in relation to its fair value 
the company tested five other reporting units for impairment during the third quarter of  including one reporting unit in the virginia tennessee market  one each in the north carolina and mid south markets  and the company s blockdot and dealtaker 
com operations 
while each of these reporting units passed the impairment test  one reporting unit in the virginia tennessee market and one reporting unit in the mid south market  with million and million of goodwill  respectively  had fair values that exceeded their respective carrying values by less than as of the date of the test 
as a result of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of  there was an additional impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets at dealtaker 
com  consequently  after the impairment  the carrying value of this reporting unit was substantially equivalent to its fair value 
the company has million of remaining goodwill at dealtaker 
com 
the company also retested the company s blockdot reporting unit in the fourth quarter with no impairment indicated 
the key assumptions for all reporting units with goodwill include those relating to revenue growth  compensation levels  benefit costs  newsprint prices  capital expenditures  discount rates and market trading multiples for broadcast and newspaper assets 
as of the end of  the company s carrying value of fcc licenses was million and no impairment was noted based on the annual impairment test 
the models the company uses to value fcc licenses are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
since the estimated fair values that arise in both the discounted cash flow and market based models are subject to change based on the company s performance and stock prices  peer company performance and stock prices  overall market conditions  and the state of the credit markets  future impairment charges of both goodwill and fcc licenses are possible 
pension plans and postretirement benefits the determination of the liabilities and cost of the company s pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension and postretirement reporting are reviewed annually with independent actuaries and are compared with external benchmarks  historical trends  and the company s own experience to determine that its assumptions are reasonable 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates health care cost trends retirement rates expected contributions a one percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a change in pension expense for of approximately million 
a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have raised or lowered the plans expense by less than thousand and would have changed the plans projected obligations by approximately million to million as of the end of in  the company took the final steps to fully freeze all benefits under its retirement plans 
self insurance liabilities the company self insures for certain medical and disability benefits  workers compensation costs  and automobile and general liability claims with specified stop loss provisions for high dollar claims 
the company estimates the liabilities for these items approximately million at december  based on historical experience and advice from actuaries and claim administrators 
actual claims experience as well as changes in health care cost trends could result in the company s eventual cost differing from this estimate 
income taxes the company files income tax returns with various state tax jurisdictions in addition to the internal revenue service and is regularly audited by both federal and state tax agencies 
from time to time  those audits may result in 
table of contents proposed adjustments 
the company has considered alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various tax agencies and does not anticipate any material impact on its earnings as a result of these audits 
the company maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions  where the probability exceeds a more likely than not standard 
the reserve for uncertain tax positions was million at the end of and the company records income tax expense using the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the differing treatments of various items for financial reporting versus tax reporting purposes 
the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the company ordinarily bases its estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates as well as expected future income 
however  the company was in a net deferred tax asset position at the end of both and and  although the company fully expects to utilize the underlying tax benefits  it could not assume future taxable income due to a cumulative book loss in recent years the direct result of non cash intangible asset impairment charges 
the company therefore established a valuation allowance 
due to the requirements of accounting interpretations related to the company s amortization of intangible assets for income tax purposes  the company anticipates recording an additional deferred tax valuation allowance of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the additional valuation allowance will be recorded as a non cash charge to income tax expense 
an explanation of this additional valuation allowance as well as a description of the situation and events that would alter it are described more fully in note and note of item of this form k 
significant changes in enacted federal and state tax laws or in expected future earnings could impact income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the valuation allowance 
summary management believes  given current facts and circumstances  supplemented by the expertise and concurrence of external resources  including actuaries  that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable and in accordance with gaap 
management further believes that the assumptions and estimates actually used in the financial statements  taken as a whole  represent the most appropriate choices from among reasonably possible alternatives and fairly present the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
management will continue to discuss key estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
results of operations net income the company recorded net losses of million per share  million per share and million per share in  and  respectively 
in and  these results included non cash goodwill impairment charges totaling million and million  respectively  as a result of challenging business conditions  the faltering economy and market perception of the value of media companies 
for a complete discussion of these impairment charges  see the impairment section in this md a and note in item of this form k 
in  the company completed the sale of a fifth and final held for sale television station as well as a small business magazine and recorded an after tax gain of million related to these divestitures 
results of the sold television station and the business magazine and their related websites have been reported as discontinued operations 
see note of item in this form k for a detailed discussion of the company s divestitures 
as the economy continued to deteriorate over the last several years  the company implemented various cost curtailment plans  which included reducing its workforce in an effort to better align its costs with the declining business environment 
these workforce reductions were in response to a general economic downturn  and particularly to the deep housing induced recession in the florida market 
over the past four years  full time equivalent employees have been reduced by approximately to approximately  employees 
as the company trimmed its workforce  severance costs of million  million and million were included in operating expenses for  and  respectively 
additionally  the company implemented mandatory employee furlough programs in both and  whereby most employees had days of unpaid leave in each of those years 
in  the company s improved operating performance prompted reimbursement of the equivalent of days of furlough to participating employees 

table of contents the company had a loss from continuing operations of million  million and million in  and however  these year over year comparisons included the ramifications of a complicated tax situation as well as pretax impairment charges of million in and million in  as discussed earlier 
the company recorded income tax expense related to continuing operations of million and million in and  respectively  as compared to an income tax benefit of million in in and  the company s tax provision had an unusual relationship to its pretax income from continuing operations due primarily to the existence of a full deferred tax valuation allowance and a deferred tax liability that could not be used to offset deferred tax assets termed a naked credit 
for a more detailed discussion of the events and circumstances surrounding this non cash naked credit  see the income taxes section of this md a and note in item of this form k 
the company s loss from continuing operations before income taxes was million excluding the million pretax impairment charge  compared to income from continuing operations before income taxes of million in this deterioration in performance was caused by a decrease in revenues  and led to a decline in segment operating profits in from the prior year 
significantly reduced political advertising in this odd numbered year comprised more than half of the year over year revenue shortfall 
as the economic recovery struggled in  advertising revenues suffered  particularly in print 
in a concerted effort to mitigate the revenue weakness  discretionary spending was reduced as evidenced by a decrease in operating costs excluding impairment in from the prior year despite a million year over year increase in severance expense 
interest expense was down in due primarily to the absence of million of expense as a result of debt issuance costs that were expensed immediately upon entering into the revised financing structure in february  maturity of the remaining interest rate swaps and a small decline in average debt outstanding was responsible for the remaining decrease 
the company recorded income from continuing operations before income taxes of million in as compared to income from continuing operations before income taxes of million in excluding the million pretax impairment charge 
the largest factors in these year over year results were a increase in interest expense reflecting the revised financing structure put into place in february  which was virtually offset by an equally significant improvement in segment operating results 
this million increase in segment operating profits in from the prior year was principally attributable to a increase in revenues driven in large part by strong political advertising combined with a decrease in segment operating costs 
segment expenses were held in check primarily due to lower costs in the areas of newsprint  benefits  and depreciation and amortization 
however  corporate expense was up due principally to the impact of employee furlough days which did not recur from and the absence of a million gain from resulting from the final freeze of retirement plans 
additionally  total operating costs in were favorably impacted by substantially higher fixed asset sale gains 
segment results the geographically managed segments are virginia tennessee  florida  mid south  north carolina  and ohio rhode island 
a sixth segment includes the company s interactive advertising services and certain other operations 
geographic markets revenues revenues are grouped primarily into five major categories local  national  political  classified  and subscription content circulation which includes newspaper circulation  broadcast retransmission revenues  and interactive subscription and content revenues 
the following chart summarizes the year over year changes in these select revenue categories change in market revenue by major category versus versus in thousands amount percent amount percent local national classified political   nm subs content circulation nm is not meaningful 

table of contents as illustrated in the previous chart  broadcast political advertising time sales are typically higher in even numbered years as a result of the national and statewide political races which generate additional advertising dollars 
political advertising  or its absence in a given year  cause a certain cyclicality which is demonstrated in the following graph showing political advertising as a percentage of total television time sales 
accordingly  yielded higher political advertising revenues  which were in sharp contrast to and with little deviation from historical trend  political time sales in exceeded six and one half times the prior year level due to strong spending associated with us congressional races and issue spending in certain states 
logo in  revenues were down across all major categories 
a general weakness in advertising at the company s print operations contributed to the year over year revenue decline in and to shrinking classified revenues across the last several years 
additionally  the absence of several items in were factors in the current year revenue decline  including million in olympic revenues  nearly million in super bowl revenues which aired on fox in  and approximately million of bp image advertising related to the gulf oil spill 
at the opposite end of the spectrum  these items bolstered revenue comparisons to the prior year 
as expected  political advertising revenues dropped dramatically in and made the strongest contribution to the company s improved year over year revenues in despite signs of firming in national broadcast transactional business in  national advertising revenues in reflected the absence of last year s bp advertising as well as advertiser uncertainty in reaction to a sputtering economic recovery 
over the past three years  local and classified revenues were down year over year due to lower newspaper advertising 
in  local advertising fell just short of the prior year amount  reflecting a solid broadcast performance despite some displacement of transactional advertising by political issue and candidate spending 
classified advertising continued to struggle and had a greater impact in markets where there was a heavier mix of newspapers 
subscription content circulation revenues were down less than in from the prior year due to lower newspaper circulation which more than offset a rise in cable and satellite retransmission revenues and remained flat in while not yet a major revenue category  the company s printing distribution operations have continued to expand and are becoming an increasingly important contributor to overall revenues as evidenced by year over year increases of million and million in and  respectively  over the prior year equivalent periods 
revenues in the virginia tennessee market fell in and in compared to the prior years 
with the exception of political in  advertising dollars were down across all categories in both years 
in and  classified advertising fell by approximately and  respectively  and was the largest contributor to the 
table of contents year over year declines as legal advertising rates began to drop towards the end of and throughout due to regulatory changes in this area 
national and local advertising fell a combined in and in from the equivalent prior year periods 
conversely  revenues from third party printing and distribution produced double digit growth in both years 
revenues in the florida market were down in and almost in from the equivalent prior year periods 
similar to the virginia tennessee market  advertising revenues were down across all categories in both years with the exception of political advertising 
in  political advertising was robust as a result of florida s hotly contested gubernatorial  congressional  and attorney general races  combined with issue spending 
however  the continued soft housing market and high unemployment in the tampa bay area remained detrimental factors to the market s overall revenue performance in and in  national advertising suffered the largest decline down as the absence of revenues from both the winter olympics and bp image advertising had a considerable impact 
in  local advertising was also negatively impacted down by the lack of olympic revenue  classified advertising fell 
despite the presence of olympic advertising and bp advertising in  classified  local and national advertising were down  and  respectively  from  reflecting some displacement of transactional advertising by political spending as well as a weakened advertising environment across all sources of advertising dollars at that time 
revenues in the mid south market fell in but rose in compared to prior years 
with of the company s network affiliated television stations  the mid south market is significantly influenced by political advertising 
the decreased political advertising in s off election year freed up additional advertising inventory and allowed for solid gains in local advertising up and national advertising up 
partially mitigating the decline in political advertising and a moderate decrease in classified advertising  was an approximate increase in printing and distribution revenues  as well as a rise in subscription content circulation revenues in over strong political advertising in resulting from both primary and general election spending provided the lion s share of the year over year improvement  however  an approximate increase in both local and national advertising contributed as well 
success was also achieved from new printing and distribution arrangements which grew in from the prior year 
revenues in the north carolina market decreased in and in from the comparable periods in and while both years suffered declines in local and classified advertising  national advertising regained its footing in and improved over  only to recede in from the prior year 
in  local down and classified down advertising declines compared to decreases of local and classified in from classified advertising struggled due to lower legal and real estate advertising in and weak automotive advertising in political advertising almost tripled in over the prior year due primarily to congressional races and higher issue spending 
with the addition of usa today as a third party customer towards the end of  printing and distribution revenues nearly doubled in over revenues in the ohio rhode island market decreased in but increased in  from the prior year 
this is the company s only geographic market which does not include any newspaper operations and is consequently less influenced by classified advertising  but more affected by the ebb and flow of political and olympics revenues in corresponding odd and even numbered years 
both of this market s television stations are nbc affiliates and  consequently  reaped the full benefit of winter olympics advertising 
increased local advertising in was unable to offset the lack of olympic revenues and significantly diminished political revenues 
local advertising revenues improved in over due to increased spending in the automotive category combined with the success of new local business development 
in  advertising revenues were up across all categories 
strong national advertising up and solid local advertising up in this broadcast intensive market supported signs of an overall strengthening in broadcast transactional business 
political advertising advances in were the result of gubernatorial and congressional elections  combined with intense issue spending 
operating expenses excluding impairment  total operating costs dropped in and less than in the company manages its expenses  to the extent possible  based on the revenue opportunities in each market 
over the past few years in particular  the company has reacted to the challenging advertising environment by aggressively reducing costs across all markets and modifying its operations to achieve greater efficiencies 
several factors have exacerbated the slow pace of economic recovery including a lack of clarity in the global financial markets and a prevailing uncertainty 
table of contents regarding the federal government s domestic plan of action 
the resultant soft advertising market prompted the company to reduce discretionary spending and to implement both targeted reductions in force and furlough programs which mandated most employees take unpaid days in and 
workforce reductions were necessary to align expenses with the prevailing economic conditions and  as discussed previously  resulted in pretax severance costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
after several years of virtually freezing all merit increases as well as suspending the company s k match  the company reinstated modest merit increases and a k match of up to of the employee s salary as of the beginning of despite these increased costs in  employee compensation was down from due to lower employee counts  furlough savings and decreased stock based compensation expense 
in  total employee compensation expense decreased less than from the prior year due to reductions in force  lower medical spending  and a full year of suspended k match versus nine months in  which were virtually offset by costs associated with the absence of furlough days in and new or promoted employees 
newsprint expense increased in from the prior year due to a increase in average cost per ton  and decreased in from the prior year due primarily to substantial reductions in consumption because of lower advertising linage  decreased circulation volumes  web width reductions and concerted conservation efforts 
the average cost per ton also decreased in depreciation and amortization expense was down in and in from the equivalent prior year periods as assets completing their depreciable lives outpaced new assets due to lower capital spending in recent years 
in the following discussion which addresses the details surrounding expense fluctuations across the markets  two factors remain constant within most of those markets year over year compensation costs were down in excluding severance cost and and generally had the largest impact on reducing each market s operating expenses  and newsprint costs rose in due to price  but declined in primarily as a result of reduced consumption 
operating expenses in the virginia tennessee market decreased in and in from the prior years 
lower compensation costs made up the largest portion of the operating expense decrease in both years 
higher newsprint costs up were more than offset by lower compensation expense 
in  newsprint costs shrunk and contributed to the overall year over year operating expense decrease 
operating expenses in the florida market were down in and in in response to the continuing economic challenges in the florida market  the company implemented a workforce reduction at its florida print properties in late  the benefit of which will be evident in s performance 
compensation cost rose slightly in from the prior year due to a million increase in severance expense  but declined in savings from reduced departmental spending were achieved in in numerous areas  but most significantly in production costs and programming rights 
increased newsprint costs up in were more than offset by lower employee compensation costs excluding severance cost  reduced departmental spending and diminished depreciation and amortization costs 
in  newsprint costs declined from running counter to trend  operating expenses in the mid south market increased in and in as compared to the prior years 
in  lower salary costs played a smaller role than in other markets due to the moderating effect of increased commissions related to non political revenues 
additionally  costs related to sales incentives were up in due primarily to the market s strong performance in garnering local advertising revenues 
in  a increase in employee compensation expense was responsible for the market s increased year over year costs due not only to the absence of current year furlough days  but also to the market s strong performance which resulted in higher sales incentives and commissions 
this market has a heavier mix of broadcast stations than newspapers and therefore  while newsprint costs were up in and down in  they were less significant to the market s overall operating expense fluctuations than in other markets 
operating expenses decreased in and in in the north carolina market 
in  lower employee compensation accounted for the majority of the expense savings  in  compensation costs were down as compared to as was the case in most of the markets  a drop in depreciation and amortization expense aided the market s overall results in both years 
also following trend  newsprint costs rose in  but decreased to contribute to the expense savings in from the prior year 
operating expenses in the ohio rhode island market decreased in and increased in compared to the prior year 
in  careful management of discretionary spending manifested itself through lower departmental expense and drove the market s overall operating expense reduction 
savings in depreciation and amortization also contributed to the market s expense savings 
due to similar circumstances as those at the mid south market in  improved prior year performance in the ohio rhode island market led to higher sales incentives and commissions 
newsprint was not a factor as the company does not operate any newspapers in the ohio rhode island market 

table of contents advertising services other advertising services other aso primarily includes blockdot an advergaming business that also produces other forms of branded entertainment  dealtaker 
com an online social shopping portal  netinformer a provider of mobile advertising and marketing services  and production services comprised primarily of a provider of broadcast equipment and studio design services 
revenues in the advertising services other segment decreased in from the comparative period of the market s revenue decline was due in large part to a million reduction in revenues at dealtaker 
com that was driven by a significant change in the way internet search results are delivered by google that affected many e commerce businesses 
also contributing to the market s decreased revenues was a million decline in revenues at blockdot due to the softness of the economy 
netinformer displayed modest revenue improvement and posted a 
million increase in revenues in the aso decreased in and were comprised of revenue declines of at blockdot attributable to fewer advergaming projects and at dealtaker 
com due to lower placement within search engine results  combined with the absence of certain products which are now either being managed in their respective geographic market or have been discontinued 
the revenue shortfall from was partially offset by an increase in revenues in the production services operations due to higher sales and installation of broadcast equipment and  to a lesser degree  a revenue improvement at netinformer 
operating costs were down approximately in and in in  lower compensation costs combined with targeted expense reductions at blockdot to produce the savings 
in  higher costs associated with investments to grow the mobile business were more than offset by the absence of expenses associated with the previously mentioned products which no longer reside in the aso segment 
operating profit loss the following chart shows the change in operating profit loss by market  the year over year movement in market operating profit was driven by the underlying fluctuations in revenue and expense as detailed in the previous discussion 
versus versus in millions amount percent amount percent virginia tennessee florida nm mid south north carolina ohio rhode island advertising services other nm nm is not meaningful 
with the exception of north carolina  all markets fell short in of achieving their operating profit performance 
the north carolina market was successful at outpacing lower revenues by reducing operating costs 
revenues were down in this off election year at all markets due to a lack of political advertising and to a soft advertising market  particularly at the company s print operations  lower revenues consequently drove the operating profit declines for most markets 
excluding the mid south market  all other markets successfully reduced operating 
table of contents costs 
in  the florida market fell farthest from its prior year mark  however  a course of action was put into motion in late that included a reduction in workforce at the print and online operations in tampa  a fresh leadership team and other cost saving measures that will continue to improve the florida market s performance as unfolds 
despite the continued challenges presented by a slow to recover economy  the company generated improved year over year total segment operating profits in for the first time since the company s broadcast intensive markets mid south and ohio rhode island made the largest contributions to the million increase in operating profits due in large part to vigorous political advertising 
the florida market also showed marked improvement which stemmed not only from robust political revenues which were unable to offset weakness in all other revenue categories  but also from a reduction in costs 
interest expense interest expense decreased million in from the prior year 
the prior year included million in debt issuance costs that were immediately expensed when the company entered into its revised financing structure in february absent this write off  interest expense would have decreased less than due primarily to a million reduction in average debt outstanding and the remaining interest rate swaps maturing in the third quarter of in the third quarter of  the company entered into three interest rate swaps where it paid a fixed rate and received a floating rate to manage interest cost and cash flows associated with variable interest rates  primarily short term changes in libor  not to trade such instruments for profit or loss 
the interest rate swaps were carried at fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis predicated on quoted libor prices of the estimated amounts the company would have received or paid to terminate the swaps 
these interest rate swaps were cash flow hedges with notional amounts originally totaling million  swaps with notional amounts of million matured in  and the remaining million matured in august of impairment in  the effects of the weakening economic recovery on certain of the company s geographic markets  combined with the stock market s perception of the value of media company stocks  including media general s  led the company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of it resulted in a non cash pretax goodwill impairment charge of million related to certain print properties in the virginia tennessee market 
later in  dealtaker 
com failed its annual impairment test  resulting in a pretax impairment charge totaling million comprised of million related to goodwill and million related to other intangibles 
for additional information on these impairment charges  see the intangible assets section under critical accounting estimates and assumptions in this md a and note of item in this form k 
income taxes the company s and tax rate had an unusual relationship to pretax income from continuing operations due primarily to the existence of a full deferred tax valuation allowance 
income tax expense in and was million and million  respectively  both periods were heavily impacted by the presence of additional valuation allowance of million and million  respectively in connection with the tax amortization of the company s indefinite lived intangible assets that is not available to offset existing deferred tax assets termed a naked credit 
in  this non cash tax expense was partially offset by the tax benefit related to the impairment charge and a benefit related to the maturity of the interest rate swaps and the resultant tax effect on other comprehensive income oci 
in  the expense related to the naked credit was partially offset by tax benefits related to an additional net operating loss nol carryback refund and a favorable settlement of a state income tax issue 
in contrast  the company reported an income tax benefit of million in  reflecting an effective tax rate on the loss from continuing operations of 
the rate reflects a normalized tax rate attributed to a nol carryback benefit of approximately million and a tax benefit related to a favorable outcome in a state income tax case  as well as the intraperiod tax allocation rules 
as of december  and december  the company had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against its net deferred tax asset because cumulative pretax income in recent years was in an overall loss position principally due to non cash impairment charges 
the year over year increase was primarily attributable to the additional valuation allowance required in connection with the naked credit  a significant increase in the unfunded pension liability recorded against oci  as well as the current year s taxable loss 
see note in item of this form k for a complete discussion of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 

table of contents other the company s network affiliation agreements with nbc were originally scheduled to expire on december  but were extended through june  as negotiations for a long term agreement continue 
these negotiations may result in an increase in network compensation payments to nbc  under which the broadcaster compensates the network for programming pursuant to affiliation agreements 
the company s network affiliation agreements for its abc and cbs stations are due for renewal in and  respectively 
the company currently expects that it will renew these network affiliation agreements prior to their expiration dates

as disclosed in note of item of this form k  the company had a non current liability for uncertain tax positions of approximately million at december  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or period in which the ultimate settlement of these uncertain tax positions will occur  therefore the contractual obligations table excludes this liability 
the bank term loan facility matures in march absent the occurrence of the extension event  however  there is an annual requirement to use excess cash flow to repay debt 
other factors such as the sale of assets and the issuance of new notes may also result in a mandatory prepayment 
the company made principal payments of million in interest obligations presented in the table above are based on the december libor plus a margin of and assume no prepayments of principal  actual interest payments could differ substantially due to the amendments described above

in addition  broadcast revenue drivers are strong and the company s highly ranked stations are positioned to garner the associated revenues from political  olympic and super bowl advertising both shown on the company s eight nbc stations  as well as higher retransmission fees 
retransmission revenues are expected to increase meaningfully in the coming years beginning in early as the company renegotiates rates upon renewing agreements 
despite an expectation of slightly higher operating costs  due partly to the absence of furlough savings and increased newsprint costs in  higher revenues are expected to generate increased operating profits 
while interest costs will be higher in  the company s recently amended credit agreement will provide the company with more flexibility to operate in an uncertain advertising environment  as well as expanded opportunities to reduce total debt through asset sales and pursue further refinancing options
