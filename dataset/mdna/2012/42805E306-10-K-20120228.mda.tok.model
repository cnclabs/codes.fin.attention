item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in items and of this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements  which include statements concerning future revenue sources and concentration  gross profit margins  selling and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  capital resources  additional financings or borrowings and additional losses  are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k  particularly in item a risk factors  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
the forward looking statements set forth in this form k are as of the close of business on february   and we undertake no duty and do not intend to update this information 
overview we develop  manufacture  market  sell and support veterinary products 
our business is comprised of two reportable segments  core companion animal health  which represented of our revenue  and other vaccines  pharmaceuticals and products which represented of our revenue 
the core companion animal health segment cca includes diagnostic and other instruments and supplies as well as single use diagnostic and other tests  pharmaceuticals and vaccines  primarily for canine and feline use 
diagnostic and other instruments and supplies represented approximately of our revenue 
many products in this area involve placing an instrument in the field and generating future revenue from consumables  including items such as supplies and service  as that instrument is used 
approximately of our revenue resulted from the sale of such consumables to an installed base of instruments and approximately of our revenue was from new hardware 
a loss of or disruption in supply of consumables we are selling to an installed base of instruments could substantially harm our business 
all of our diagnostic instruments and supplies are furnished to us by third parties  who typically own the product rights and sell the product to us under marketing and or distribution agreements 
in many cases  we have collaborated with a third party to adapt a human instrument for veterinary use 
major products in this area include our chemistry instruments  our hematology instruments and our blood gas instruments and their affiliated operating consumables 
revenue from products in these three areas  including revenue from consumables  represented approximately of our revenue 
other cca revenue  including single use diagnostic and other tests  pharmaceuticals and vaccines as well as research and development  licensing and royalty revenue  represented approximately of our revenue 
since items in this area are single use by their nature  our aim is to build customer satisfaction and loyalty for each product  generate repeat annual sales from existing customers and expand our customer base in the future 
products in this area are both supplied by third parties and provided by us 
major products in this area include our heartworm diagnostic tests  our heartworm preventive  our allergy test kits  our allergy immunotherapy and our allergy diagnostic tests 
combined revenue from heartworm related products and allergy related products represented approximately of our revenue 
we consider the cca segment to be our core business and devote most of our management time and other resources to improving the prospects for this segment 
maintaining a continuing  reliable and economic supply of products we currently obtain from third parties is critical to our success in this area 
virtually all of our sales and marketing expenses are in the core companion animal health segment 
the majority of our research and development spending is dedicated to this segment  as well 
we strive to provide high value products and advance the state of veterinary medicine 
all our cca products ultimately are sold primarily to or through veterinarians 
in many cases  veterinarians will mark up their costs to the end user 
the acceptance of our products by veterinarians is critical to our success 
cca products are sold directly by us as well as through distribution relationships  such as our corporate agreement with spah  the sale of kits to conduct blood testing to third party veterinary diagnostic laboratories and independent third party distributors 
revenue from direct sales and distribution relationships represented approximately and of core companion animal health revenue  respectively 
we intend to increase profitability through a combination of revenue growth  gross margin improvement and expense control 
accordingly  we closely monitor revenue growth trends in our cca segment 
revenue in this segment increased by million  or  in as compared to we believe poor economic conditions over the past several years have impacted our revenue as  for example  veterinarians have continued to delay or defer capital expenditures on new diagnostic instrumentation 
the other vaccines  pharmaceuticals and products segment ovp includes our  square foot usda and fda licensed production facility in des moines  iowa 
we view this facility as an asset which will allow us to control our cost of goods on any vaccines and pharmaceuticals that we may commercialize in the future 
virtually all our us inventory is now stored at this facility and most fulfillment logistics are managed there 
cca segment products manufactured at this facility are transferred at cost and are not recorded as revenue for our ovp segment 
we view ovp reported revenue as revenue primarily to cover the overhead costs of the facility and to generate incremental cash flow to fund our cca segment 
our ovp segment includes private label vaccine and pharmaceutical production  primarily for cattle but also for other animals such as small mammals 
all ovp products are sold by third parties under third party labels 
we have developed our own line of bovine vaccines that are licensed by the usda 
we have a long term  non exclusive agreement with a distributor  agri laboratories  ltd  agrilabs  for the marketing and sale of certain of these vaccines which are sold primarily under the titanium and masterguard brands which are registered trademarks of agrilabs 
this agreement generates a significant portion of our ovp segment s revenue 
our ovp segment also produces vaccines and pharmaceuticals for other third parties 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we have identified those critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial position and results of operations based upon a consideration of those accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessment 
we consider the following to be our critical policies 
revenue recognition we generate our revenue through the sale of products  as well as through licensing of technology product rights  royalties and sponsored research and development 
our policy is to recognize revenue when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  which generally include the following persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized after both the goods are shipped to the customer and acceptance has been received  if required  with an appropriate provision for estimated returns and allowances 
we do not permit general returns of products sold 
certain of our products have expiration dates 
our policy is to exchange certain outdated  expired product with the same product 
we record an accrual for the estimated cost of replacing the expired product expected to be returned in the future  based on our historical experience  adjusted for any known factors that reasonably could be expected to change historical patterns  such as regulatory actions which allow us to extend the shelf life of our products 
revenue from both direct sales to veterinarians and sales to independent third party distributors are generally recognized when goods are shipped 
our products are shipped complete and ready to use by the customer 
the terms of the customer arrangements generally pass title and risk of ownership to the customer at the time of shipment 
certain customer arrangements provide for acceptance provisions 
revenue for these arrangements is not recognized until the acceptance has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
we reduce our revenue by the estimated cost of any rebates  allowances or similar programs  which are used as promotional programs 
recording revenue from the sale of products involves the use of estimates and management judgment 
we must make a determination at the time of sale whether the customer has the ability to make payments in accordance with arrangements 
while we do utilize past payment history  and  to the extent available for new customers  public credit information in making our assessment  the determination of whether collectability is reasonably assured is ultimately a judgment decision that must be made by management 
we must also make estimates regarding our future obligation relating to returns  rebates  allowances and similar other programs 
license revenue under arrangements to sell or license product rights or technology rights is recognized as obligations under the agreement are satisfied  which generally occurs over a period of time 
generally  licensing revenue is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the related agreements  products  patents or technology 
nonrefundable licensing fees  marketing rights and milestone payments received under contractual arrangements are deferred and recognized over the remaining contractual term using the straight line method 
recording revenue from license arrangements involves the use of estimates 
the primary estimate made by management is determining the useful life of the related agreement  product  patent or technology 
we evaluate all of our licensing arrangements by estimating the useful life of either the product or the technology  the length of the agreement or the legal patent life and defer the revenue for recognition over the appropriate period 
occasionally we enter into arrangements that include multiple elements 
such arrangements may include the licensing of technology and manufacturing of product 
in these situations we must determine whether the various elements meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate elements 
if the elements cannot be separated  revenue is recognized once revenue recognition criteria for the entire arrangement have been met or over the period that the company s obligations to the customer are fulfilled  as appropriate 
if the elements are determined to be separable  the revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on relative fair value and recognized separately for each element when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in accounting for these multiple element arrangements  we must make determinations about whether elements can be accounted for separately and make estimates regarding their relative fair values 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on client specific allowances  as well as a general allowance 
specific allowances are maintained for clients which are determined to have a high degree of collectability risk based on such factors  among others  as i the aging of the accounts receivable balance  ii the client s past payment experience  iii a deterioration in the client s financial condition  evidenced by weak financial condition and or continued poor operating results  reduced credit ratings  and or a bankruptcy filing 
in addition to the specific allowance  the company maintains a general allowance for credit risk in its accounts receivable which is not covered by a specific allowance 
the general allowance is established based on such factors  among others  as i the total balance of the outstanding accounts receivable  including considerations of the aging categories of those accounts receivable  ii past history of uncollectable accounts receivable write offs  and iii the overall creditworthiness of the client base 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realizability of accounts receivable 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of the overall allowance change  an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts receivable may be necessary 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
inventories are written down if the estimated net realizable value of an inventory item is less than its recorded value 
we review the carrying cost of our inventories by product each quarter to determine the adequacy of our reserves for obsolescence 
in accounting for inventories we must make estimates regarding the estimated net realizable value of our inventory 
this estimate is based  in part  on our forecasts of future sales and shelf life of product 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance our deferred tax assets  such as an nol  are reduced by an offsetting valuation allowance based on judgmental assessment of available evidence if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all of the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
if we are able to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize a future benefit from a deferred tax asset  we will reduce the related valuation allowance by an amount equal to the estimated quantity of income taxes we would pay in cash if we were not to utilize the deferred tax asset in the future 
the first time this occurs in a given jurisdiction  it will result in a net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet and an income tax benefit of equal magnitude in our statement of operations in the period we make the determination 
in future periods  we will then recognize as income tax expense the estimated quantity of income taxes we would have paid in cash had we not utilized the related deferred tax asset 
the corresponding journal entry will be a reduction of our deferred tax asset 
if there is a change regarding our tax position in the future  we will make a corresponding adjustment to the related valuation allowance 
results of operations the following table summarizes our results of operations for the three most recent fiscal years september  september  september  year ended december  in thousands except per share amounts consolidated statement of income data revenue core companion animal health other vaccines  pharmaceuticals and products total revenue  net cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income interest and other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income basic net income per share diluted net income per share revenue total revenue increased to million in compared to million in total revenue decreased to million in compared to million in cca segment revenue increased to million in compared to million in key factors in the increase were greater sales of our instrument consumables  our canine heartworm preventive and international sales of our canine heartworm diagnostic tests  somewhat offset by lower revenue from our hematology instruments and our chemistry instruments 
cca segment revenue decreased to million in compared to million in the largest factor in this decline was lower sales of consumables for our handheld blood analysis instruments which declined by million in compared to  primarily due to the loss of supply following cancellation of the underlying contract by our supplier 
other factors in the decline were lower sales of our heartworm diagnostic tests internationally and lower sales of our iv pumps 
ovp segment revenue increased to million in compared to million in greater sales of cattle vaccines to new customers  greater sales of cattle vaccines under our contract with agrilabs and greater sales of other cattle vaccines  somewhat offset by lower sales of bulk bovine biologicals  were key factors in the increase 
ovp segment revenue increased to million in compared to million in greater sales of bulk bovine and other biologicals were key factors in the increase 
this was somewhat offset by lower sales of cattle vaccines under our contract with agrilabs 
we had issues producing cattle vaccines to appropriate specifications and  as a result  did not ship any related cattle vaccine products in the three months ended june  and replaced certain cattle vaccine inventory with new cattle vaccine inventory in the three months ended december  we expect total revenue to increase as compared with cost of revenue cost of revenue was million  an increase of compared to million in gross profit increased to million in from million in gross margin  ie gross profit divided by total revenue  increased to in from in the largest factor was approximately million in net costs for destroyed product  replacement product and related reserves in our ovp segment regarding regulatory issues with certain of our cattle vaccines which was recognized in  but not cost of revenue was million  a decrease of compared to million in gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross margin  ie gross profit divided by total revenue  increased to in from in a key factor in the increase was product mix  where the overall sales shift was toward higher margin products 
this was somewhat offset by approximately million in net costs for destroyed product  replacement product and related reserves in our ovp segment regarding regulatory issues with certain of our cattle vaccines 
we expect gross margin to increase in as compared to operating expenses selling and marketing expenses increased by to million in compared to million in greater recruiting and relocation costs related to the expansion of our sales force and increased spending related to product marketing programs were factors in the increase 
selling and marketing expenses increased by to million in compared to million in spending related to the full launch of our new blood gas analyzer in was a factor in the increase 
research and development expenses increased by thousand to million in from million in a factor in the increase was a payment to a third party related to a product line we are collaborating to develop with that company 
research and development expenses decreased by thousand to million in from million in a factor in the decline was lower spending on research and development resources  such as laboratory supplies 
general and administrative expenses were million in  a increase as compared to million in the largest factor in the increase was a management incentive plan mip expense in related to the achievement of certain objectives  which did not occur in general and administrative expenses were million in  a decline as compared to million in a factor in the decline was no mip payouts were earned in while there was an mip payout earned in we expect operating expenses will be higher than in interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net was income of thousand in  as compared to an expense of thousand in and an expense of thousand in this line item can be broken into two components net interest expense and net foreign currency gains and losses 
net interest was income of thousand in  as compared to expense of thousand in and expense of thousand in the largest factor in the improvement from to was thousand in interest income from an arbitration judgment which is described in greater detail below in liquidity  capital resources and financial condition 
the largest factor in the decrease in net interest expenses between as compared to was lower loan balances and lower market interest rates  somewhat offset by an increased interest rate spread negotiated with wells fargo in december net foreign currency losses were thousand in and thousand in and net foreign currency gains were thousand in we expect interest and other expense  net to be a net expense in as we have a thousand minimum interest expense under our agreement with wells fargo and we do not anticipate we will experience interest income at the same level as in  which resulted primarily from interest awarded in an arbitration judgment 
income tax expense benefit in  we had total income tax expense of million  including million in domestic deferred income tax expense  a non cash expense  and thousand in current income tax expense  the majority of which related to state income taxes 
in  we had thousand of current tax expense and thousand in deferred tax benefit  resulting in total income tax expense of thousand 
the largest component of current tax expense relates to the profitable operating performance of our swiss subsidiary 
domestically  the effect of permanent differences between tax and gaap accounting  such as incentive stock option amortization  at low profitability levels tends to raise the implied tax rate and contributed to our unusually high tax rate 
in  domestic deferred income tax expense  a non cash expense  represented million of our million total income tax expense and current tax expense of thousand represented the balance 
in  we expect higher income tax expense as compared to as we expect higher pre tax income in as compared to net income loss our net income was million as compared to net income of thousand and net income of million in increased revenue and improved gross margin  somewhat offset by higher operating expenses  were key factors in the improvement from to lower year over year revenue was the key factor in the decline in net income between and we expect net income will be higher in than in  primarily as a result of increased revenue and improved gross margin  somewhat offset by higher operating expenses 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition we have incurred net cumulative negative cash flow from operations since our inception in for the year ended december   we had net income of million 
in  net cash provided by operations was million 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  working capital of million and no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  discussed below 
in the fourth quarter of  we received an arbitration judgment in a dispute with one of our former distributors to whom we gave notice of contract termination in january the dispute was regarding matters including amounts past due and counterclaims by our former distributor 
we were awarded a net judgment in excess of million  which was received prior to year end included in the amount ordered by the arbiter were over thousand in principal  which was credited against the affiliated receivable  thousand in interest  which we recognized as interest income in the fourth quarter of and thousand in reimbursed legal and other expenses  which were credited against our general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of net cash flows from operating activities provided cash of million in as compared to million in key factors in the change were an improvement of million in net income  a million increase in cash provided by deferred tax expense  which is a non cash charge  and a thousand improvement in cash provided by accounts receivable  with the payment resulting from arbitration in the fourth quarter of as a key factor in this change 
these were somewhat offset by thousand greater cash used by accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other  related to the timing of payments  and thousand in lower depreciation and amortization expense  primarily related to lower depreciation on instrument units available for customer rental 
net cash flows from operating activities provided cash of million in as compared to providing cash of million in the largest factor in the change was a million decrease in cash provided from inventory as we did not lower our inventory level at year end compared to year end as much as in compared to  and we had a greater non cash transfer of inventory to property and equipment in as compared to other major factors in the change were a million decrease in cash provided by net income resulting from our operating performance and a million decrease in cash provided by deferred tax benefit resulting from our lower level of profitability in this was somewhat offset by a million decline in cash used by deferred revenue and other  primarily relating to lower contractual prepayments near year end and lower upfront payment amortization scheduled for versus net cash flows from investing activities used cash of million in as compared to using cash of thousand in and using cash of thousand in purchases of property and equipment increased thousand in as compared to and thousand in as compared to  primarily due to greater property and equipment purchases in our ovp segment 
net cash flows from financing activities used cash of million in  used cash of million in and used cash of million in in  we used cash to fully repay our remaining million in line of credit borrowings  which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and upon option exercises 
in  we used cash to reduce our borrowings under our line of credit by million and repay the remaining principal on term debt of thousand  which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and upon option exercises 
in  we used cash to reduce our borrowings under our line of credit by million and repay principal on term debt of thousand  which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we repaid more debt under our revolving line of credit in and as compared to primarily because we had greater cash provided by operating activities in and as compared to at december   we had a million asset based revolving line of credit with wells fargo which has a maturity date of december  at december   there were no borrowings outstanding on this line of credit 
our ability to borrow under this line of credit varies based upon available cash  eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory 
as a result of an amendment to our agreement with wells fargo signed in december  on december   any interest on borrowings due was to be charged at a stated rate of three month libor plus and was to be payable monthly 
we expect any interest on borrowings due after february to be charged at a stated rate of three month libor plus based on the terms of our agreement with wells fargo 
we are required to comply with various financial and non financial covenants  and we have made various representations and warranties under our agreement with wells fargo 
among the financial covenants is a requirement to maintain a minimum liquidity cash plus excess borrowing base of million 
additional requirements include covenants for minimum capital monthly and minimum net income quarterly 
failure to comply with any of the covenants  representations or warranties could result in our being in default on the loan and could cause all outstanding amounts payable to wells fargo to become immediately due and payable or impact our ability to borrow under the agreement 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  at december   our available borrowing capacity based upon eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory under our revolving line of credit was approximately million 
in the first quarter of  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share to the holders of record of our public common stock on march   payable on april  we intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend of per share of outstanding public common stock for the foreseeable future at the discretion of our board of directors considering available cash  anticipated cash needs  overall financial condition  loan agreement restrictions  future prospects for earnings and cash flows  anticipated tax treatment as well as other relevant factors 
we would consider strategic acquisitions if we felt they were consistent with our strategic direction 
our board of directors has considered  and may consider in the future  a stock buyback as an alternative use of our cash 
our primary short term need for capital  which is subject to change  is to fund our operations  which consist of continued sales and marketing  general and administrative and research and development efforts  working capital associated with increased product sales and capital expenditures relating to maintaining and developing our manufacturing operations 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which our marketing and selling efforts  as well as those of third parties who market  sell and distribute our products  are successful in increasing our revenue  competition  the extent to which currently planned products and or technologies under development are successfully developed  launched and sold  any changes required by regulatory bodies to maintain our operations and other factors 
our financial plan for indicates that our available cash and cash equivalents  together with cash from operations and borrowings expected to be available under our revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to fund our operations through and into however  our actual results may differ from this plan  and we may be required to consider alternative strategies 
we may be required to raise additional capital in the future 
if necessary  we expect to raise these additional funds through the sale of equity securities or the issuance of new term debt secured by the same assets as the term loans which were fully repaid in there is no guarantee that additional capital will be available from these sources on acceptable terms  if at all  and certain of these sources may require approval by existing lenders 
if we cannot raise the additional funds through these options on acceptable terms or with the necessary timing  management could also reduce discretionary spending to decrease our cash burn rate through actions such as delaying or canceling budgeted hiring activities or marketing plans 
these actions would likely extend the then available cash and cash equivalents  and then available borrowings to some degree 
see risk factors in item a of this form k for a discussion of some of the factors that affect our capital raising alternatives 
a summary of our contractual obligations at december  is shown below september  september  september  september  september  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations in addition to those agreements considered above where our contractual obligation is fixed  we are party to commercial agreements which may require us to make milestone payments under certain circumstances 
any milestone obligations which we believe are likely to be triggered but are not yet paid are included in unconditional purchase obligations in the table above 
we do not believe other potential milestone obligations  some of which we consider to be of remote likelihood of ever being triggered  will have a material impact on our liquidity  capital resources or financial condition in the foreseeable future 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had a net domestic operating loss carryforward  or nol  of approximately million  a domestic alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately thousand and a domestic research and development tax credit carryforward of approximately thousand for federal tax purposes 
our federal nol is expected to expire as follows if unused million at the end of  million in through  million in and and thousand in the nol and tax credit carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities 
in addition  we had a change of ownership as defined under the provisions of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended an ownership change 
we believe the latest ownership change occurred at the time of our initial public offering in july we do not believe this ownership change will place a significant restriction on our ability to utilize our nols in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in the fasb amended the provisions of the fair value measurement topic of the fasb codification 
this amendment provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this topic changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements 
these provisions are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after december   applied prospectively 
the adoption of this amendment will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in the fasb amended the provisions of the comprehensive income topic of the fasb codification 
the amended provisions were issued to enhance comparability between entities that report under gaap and ifrs and to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions that affect an entity s equity 
this topic eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in shareholders equity and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
these amended provisions are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption of the new guidance is permitted and full retrospective application is required 
the adoption of this amendment will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as the amendment impacts presentation only 
in the fasb amended the provisions of the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb codification 
the provision will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
these amended provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we have elected to enact early adoption of this amendment  which did not affect our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and foreign interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
interest rate risk at december   there was no debt outstanding on our line of credit with wells fargo 
at december   we had no borrowings on our line of credit 
we also had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents at december   the majority of which was invested in liquid interest bearing accounts 
we had no interest rate hedge transactions in place on december  we completed an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis based on the above and an assumed one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates 
if market rates increase decrease by one percentage point  we would experience a decrease increase in annual net interest expense of approximately thousand based on our outstanding balances as of december  foreign currency risk our investment in foreign assets consists primarily of our investment in our swiss subsidiary 
foreign currency risk may impact our results of operations 
in cases where we purchase inventory in one currency and sell corresponding products in another  our gross margin percentage is typically at risk based on foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  in cases where we may be generating operating income in foreign currencies  the magnitude of such operating income when translated into us dollars will be at risk based on foreign currency exchange rates 
our agreements with suppliers and customers vary significantly in regard to the existence and extent of currency adjustment and other currency risk sharing provisions 
we had no foreign currency hedge transactions in place on december  we have a wholly owned subsidiary in switzerland which uses the swiss franc as its functional currency 
we purchase inventory in foreign currencies  primarily euros and japanese yen  and sell corresponding products in us dollars 
we also sell products in foreign currencies  primarily euros and japanese yen  where our inventory costs are largely in us dollars 
based on our results of operations  if foreign currency exchange rates were to strengthen weaken by against the dollar  we would expect a resulting pre tax loss gain of approximately thousand
