business environment the nation s engagement in combating threats to us national security around the world  coupled with the need to equip and modernize us military forces  drives department of defense dod funding requirements 
as a defense contractor  our financial performance is impacted by the allocation and prioritization of us defense spending 
procurement and research and development r d budgets  also known as investment accounts  provide the majority of our us defense revenues 
for fiscal year fy  the dod received funding of billion  including approximately billion for procurement and r d 
this funding was approximately billion less than the president s fy request due to the budget control act bca of the bca  which became law in august  has two primary parts 
the first mandates a billion reduction to previously planned defense spending over the next decade 
the second part is a sequester mechanism that would impose an additional billion of cuts on defense funding between fy and fy if the congress does not identify a means to reduce the us deficit by trillion 
as of february   the congress has not identified these required savings 
if the congress does not identify the required reduction  defense spending would likely sustain further cuts 
for fy  the president has requested total defense funding of billion  including billion for investment accounts 
in accordance with the first part of the bca  the dod s five year spending plan submitted with the fy funding request incorporates billion of cuts when compared with the previous five year plan 
however  the spending plan does not include the impact of sequestration  the second part of the bca 
despite these additional cuts  investment accounts are projected to display modest growth throughout the five year period  with procurement funding for mature programs growing and r d funding for development programs declining over the period 
budget expenditures lag congressional funding  with appropriated money generally awarded over several years 
a series of continuing resolutions over the past year has resulted in a protracted customer acquisition cycle that negatively impacted the flow of contract awards  particularly in our shorter cycle information systems and technology business group 
the threat of further defense spending cuts and the potential for a fourth quarter continuing resolution due to budget approval delays may further impact contract awards 
logo while the us budget deficit will continue to influence government spending decisions  we expect defense funding requirements to continue to be driven by the following support for the warfighter in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment  including the dod s increased emphasis on the asia pacific region  the number of troops deployed globally  coupled with the overall size of the us military  the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in iraq and afghanistan since  and the need to modernize defense infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern day warfare 
with these budget uncertainties  the long term success of our us defense business is enhanced by the relevance of our programs to the military s funding priorities  the diversity of our programs and customers within the budget  our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs  our ability to evolve our products to address a fast changing threat environment  and our proven track record of successful contract execution 
in addition  the continuing tenuous geopolitical landscape requires governments around the world to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs  leading to diverse defense opportunities 
we continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military equipment and information technologies from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our us businesses 
while the revenue potential can be significant  international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing  changing priorities and overall spending pressures 
as we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world  we expect our international sales and exports to grow 
in our aerospace group  business jet market conditions showed further improvement in  particularly in the large cabin market 
the group benefitted from increased flying hours across the installed base  improved new aircraft order interest and declining customer contract defaults 
continued investment in new aircraft products is expected to drive aerospace s long term growth  particularly as the group remains on track to deliver its newest aircraft offerings  the g and the g  in mid similarly  we believe that general dynamics annual report 
table of contents aircraft service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business jet fleet 
we are committed to creating shareholder value through innovative product development  disciplined program execution and continuous improvement initiatives 
our performance is measured in our sustained revenue growth  solid earnings and margins and efficient conversion of earnings into cash 
our record of excellent cash flow conversion has enabled us to execute our operational strategy while providing us the flexibility to deploy our capital to further enhance shareholder returns through acquisitions  payment of dividends and share repurchases 
results of operations introduction we recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in the aerospace and defense business groups 
an understanding of these methods is important to the evaluation of our operating results 
in the aerospace group  sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft s outfitting  which includes exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors 
we record revenues on these contracts at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer  and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft 
revenues in the aerospace group s other original equipment manufacturers oems completions and service businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of the service 
changes in revenues result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries green and outfitted  progress on aircraft completions and the level of service activity during the period 
the majority of the group s operating costs relate to new aircraft production for firm orders and consist of labor  material and overhead costs 
the costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot 
thus  the level of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered 
to a much lesser extent  the level of operating costs is impacted by changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot 
operating costs in the aerospace group s other oems completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred 
for new aircraft  operating earnings and margins in the aerospace group are a function of the prices of our aircraft  our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the higher margin large cabin and lower margin mid cabin aircraft 
additional factors affecting the group s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of completions and services work performed  the amount and type of pre owned aircraft sold and the level of general and administrative g a costs incurred by the group  which also include selling expenses and r d costs 
in the defense groups  revenue on long term government contracts is recognized as work progresses  either as products are produced or as services are rendered 
as a result  changes in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume  typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts 
year over year variances attributed to volume indicate increases or decreases in revenues due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules 
operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor  material  subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally recognized as incurred 
variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and  therefore  result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues 
operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume  performance or contract mix 
performance refers to changes in profitability during the period of performance based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts 
these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated contract value or the estimated costs required to complete the contract 
therefore  changes in costs incurred in the period do not necessarily impact profitability 
it is only when total estimated costs at completion change that profitability may be impacted 
contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher vs 
lower margin work on individual contracts and when aggregated across the contract portfolio 
on an individual contract  higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type eg  fixed price cost reimbursable or type of work eg  development production

gulfstream aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased in due to additional large cabin green and outfitted deliveries  primarily initial green deliveries of the first g aircraft in the fourth quarter 
offsetting this increase were lower completions revenues as a result of manufacturing delays on narrow and wide body commercial aircraft contracts and continued lower volume in business jet aircraft manufactured by other oems 
aircraft services revenues  which include maintenance and repair work  fixed base operations and aircraft management services  increased percent in  reflecting the growing global installed base and increased flying hours of business jet aircraft 
revenues from sales of pre owned aircraft were down slightly from  and the group ended with no pre owned aircraft in inventory

table of contents earnings from the manufacture and outfitting of gulfstream aircraft increased approximately  or more than percent  in compared with primarily due to initial green deliveries of the g aircraft 
earnings from other oems completions at jet aviation were down approximately in primarily as a result of cost growth and penalties associated with delivery delays on several narrow and wide body completions projects  including of contract losses in the fourth quarter 
as a result of losses and lower revenues on other oems business jet aircraft  we reviewed the related long lived assets of the completions business in the fourth quarter of and recognized a impairment charge on the contract and program intangible asset 
we believe that major initiatives to reduce overhead and increase production efficiency undertaken by management beginning in will stabilize performance in the completions business in despite the increase in revenues  aircraft services earnings were steady in due to competitive market pricing and an unfavorable mix of service work 
jet aviation s aircraft services earnings were also negatively impacted by the strength of the swiss franc as compared to the broader market 
the group s operating earnings in were negatively impacted by higher r d expenses and selling expenses associated with increased order activity

combat systems review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin the combat systems group s revenues were down slightly in compared with the decrease in the group s revenues consisted of the following us military vehicles weapons systems and munitions european military vehicles total decrease in the group s us military vehicle business  volume was down due to less refurbishment and upgrade work for the abrams main battle tank  fewer survivability enhancement kits for the stryker wheeled combat vehicle and a decline in activity on the expeditionary fighting vehicle efv program as the system design and development neared completion 
increased volume on the group s contracts to provide light armored vehicles lavs for several international customers partially offset these decreases 
revenues were up slightly in the group s weapons systems and munitions businesses 
increased sales of axles in the commercial and military markets were partially offset by the timing of munitions deliveries to the canadian government and the sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of revenues in the group s european military vehicles business increased in largely due to higher volume of duro and eagle wheeled vehicles to a variety of european customers  including the swiss and german governments 
offsetting this increase was lower activity on the group s pandur and piranha vehicle contracts for various international customers 
the group s operating earnings and margins were up slightly in  following a basis point margin improvement in the basis point increase in was primarily due to higher profitability on several major programs in our us military vehicles business 
general dynamics annual report

year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin in  the combat systems group s revenues decreased compared with due to reduced volume in the group s us and european military vehicles businesses 
in the group s us military vehicles business  lower mrap vehicle production and reduced engineering work  primarily related to the cancellation of the manned ground vehicle portion of the future combat systems fcs program  represented the majority of the decline in revenues 
revenues in the group s european military vehicles business decreased due to the ramp down of the leopard tank program for the spanish government and lower activity on the group s pandur and piranha contracts 
despite the decline in revenues  the combat systems group s operating earnings increased slightly in  resulting in a basis point increase in operating margins compared with productivity improvements across the group  particularly in the us military vehicles business  and a favorable contract mix that included reduced engineering and development work resulted in significant margin expansion 
outlook we expect the combat systems group s revenues to decrease to approximately billion in a reduction in our us military vehicles business primarily due to lower volume on the stryker and mrap programs will be partially offset by growth in international vehicle contracts and revenues from the december acquisition of force protection  inc we expect the group s operating margins to approximate in the low to mid percent range 
marine systems review of vs

revenues were down slightly in on the virginia class submarine program from timing of construction activity as we transitioned from the block ii to the block iii contract 
in  the group delivered the eighth boat while construction continued on the next six boats 
deliveries of the remaining boats under contract are scheduled through in our surface combatant business  the group received an award for construction of the second and third ships in the ddg destroyer program in the third quarter of due to a delay in the award  revenues were down on the program in deliveries of the three ddg ships under contract are scheduled for  and on the ddg program  volume was also lower as the legacy multi ship contract neared completion with the remaining destroyer scheduled for delivery in in the third quarter of  in connection with the navy s restart of the ddg program  the group was awarded a construction contract for a ddg destroyer scheduled for delivery in and won a competitively awarded option for an additional destroyer

volume increased in on the group s engineering work associated with the ssbn x 
the group currently is performing initial concept studies  including design of a common missile compartment for the us navy and the royal navy of the united kingdom  and reactor plant planning yard services 
the group s repair work increased in following significant growth in  particularly on surface ship repair programs 
this growth was aided by the acquisition of metro machine corp  a surface ship repair operation located in norfolk  virginia 
this addition  coupled with our existing capabilities  enables us to deliver maintenance and repair services to the atlantic and pacific fleets 
in  the group completed construction of a five ship commercial product carrier program  resulting in a decrease in commercial shipbuilding revenues in given the success of this program  the age of jones act ships and other factors  we anticipate additional commercial shipbuilding opportunities 
despite the decrease in revenues  the marine systems group s operating earnings were up in compared with  resulting in a basis point increase in operating margins 
on the t ake contract  a modification negotiated during the year and favorable cost performance resulted in revisions in contract estimates that contributed basis points to the general dynamics annual report 
table of contents group s operating margin expansion 
this operating margin growth was offset by the absence of commercial ship construction revenues and operating margin compression as we transition to several new shipbuilding contracts and lower margin service and design work increases 
review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin revenues in the marine systems group were up in primarily due to increased activity on the virginia class program as the group continued to ramp toward construction of two submarines per year and higher volume on the group s ssbn x engineering program 
lower activity on the ddg and t ake programs and the completion of the five ship commercial product carrier program slightly offset other volume increases in the group in the marine systems group s operating earnings increased in consistent with the increase in revenues as favorable performance on the t ake and commercial product carrier programs offset a shift in program mix to new shipbuilding contracts and design work 
outlook we expect the marine systems group s revenues in to decrease slightly from due to the timing of several ship construction programs  with operating margins approximating in the low to mid percent range 
information systems and technology review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin the information systems and technology group s revenues decreased in compared with the decrease in revenues consisted of the following tactical communication systems information technology it services intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance isr systems total decrease revenues in the tactical communication systems business were impacted unfavorably by recent continuing resolutions and a protracted customer acquisition cycle that slowed orders 
this resulted in lower revenues in on ruggedized computing products  including the common hardware software iii chs program  and other products with shorter term delivery timeframes 
additionally  revenues on the canadian maritime helicopter project mhp were down in as the group transitioned from production to the training and support phase of the program 
revenues were up in the group s united kingdom based operation due to higher volume on the initial phase of the uk ministry of defence specialist vehicle sv program

we expect corporate operating expenses of approximately backlog and estimated potential contract value logo our total backlog  including funded and unfunded portions  was billion at the end of compared with billion at year end strong orders on major programs across our defense groups resulted in a book to bill ratio orders divided by revenues slightly higher than  while our aerospace group generated a book to bill ratio greater than one to one 
our backlog also increased nearly billion due to our acquisitions 
our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts  which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value 
customers use idiq contracts for several reasons  including expanding the field of available contractors to maximize competition under a given program or when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed 
the estimated contract value includes multiple award idiq contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders as well as contracts where we have been designated as the sole source supplier 
we include our estimate of the remaining value we will receive under these arrangements 
contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work at the election of the customer 
these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may procure additional units or services at a future date 
contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and long term agreements with fleet customers 
we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 
on december   the estimated potential contract value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately billion  up significantly from billion at the end of this represents our estimate of the potential value we will receive 
the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower 
the estimated potential contract value increased in in our marine systems and information systems and technology groups largely due to the ddg option and common hardware systems chs idiq contract awards 
the acquisition of vangent  inc  in also added approximately billion to the information systems and technology group s estimated potential contract value 
we expect to realize this value primarily over the next several years  reflecting continued demand for our products and services well into the future 
aerospace aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer 
funded backlog includes the group s newest aircraft models  the g and the g  which are expected to receive full type certification and enter service in mid aerospace unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 
the aerospace group finished with a total backlog of billion  up slightly from billion at year end in  the group booked the highest number of orders for new aircraft since the introduction of the g in customer defaults were down more than percent from we balance aircraft production rates with customer demand to maximize profitability and level load production over time 
this has enabled us to maintain an to month period between customer order and delivery of legacy large cabin aircraft  while the g has accumulated approximately five years of backlog prior to initial deliveries 
although we expect order activity to remain strong and customer defaults to remain at low levels  backlog will likely decrease over the next several years as we deliver on our g backlog and the time period between customer order and delivery of the aircraft normalizes 
over the past few years  the group s customer base has become increasingly diverse in customer type and geographic region 
approximately two thirds of the group s year end backlog is composed of private companies and individual buyers 
while the installed base of aircraft is predominately in north america  international customers represent nearly percent of the group s backlog

at year end  there were no options to purchase new aircraft or long term agreements with fleet customers included in estimated potential contract value 
defense groups the total backlog for our defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts 
the funded portion of the defense backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer  as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments 
while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program  we have included in backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding

marine systems logo the marine systems group s backlog consists of long term submarine and ship construction programs  as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts 
the group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years 
for example  in  the group received a billion contract for the construction of eight virginia class submarines to be delivered through  increasing backlog to an all time high of billion at the end of consistent with this historical pattern  as the group has performed on these multi year contracts  the backlog has decreased to billion at year end compared to billion at the end of while backlog decreased in our submarine business  backlog increased in both of our surface shipyards from major contract awards in the virginia class submarine program was the company s largest program in and is the largest contract in the group s backlog 
the group s backlog at year end included billion for ten virginia class submarines 
as the prime contractor on the virginia class program  we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings with our teaming partner 
plans published by the navy include a request for proposals in for nine submarines under a fourth block of the program 
navy destroyer programs represent another significant component of the group s backlog 
these include the arleigh burke class ddg and zumwalt class ddg destroyer programs 
in  the group received approximately billion in orders under the ddg program  bringing the value in backlog to billion for the construction of three ships  including two awarded in  and continued engineering and support services 
at year end  the backlog also included for ddg destroyers 
the final destroyer under the navy s legacy multi ship contract is scheduled for delivery in additionally  in connection with the navy s restart of the ddg program  the group was awarded in a construction contract for a ddg destroyer and won a competitively awarded option for an additional destroyer 
the marine systems group s backlog at year end included for the mlp program 
in  the group was awarded construction contracts for the first two ships in the program and long lead funding for the third ship 
the year end backlog also included approximately for the last two ships under the navy s t ake combat logistics ship program and for the group s second ship under the navy s littoral combat ship lcs program  scheduled for delivery in in addition  the marine systems group s backlog at year end included approximately billion for engineering  repair  overhaul and other services 
this includes billion in design and engineering efforts for the ssbn x 
the group received several significant contract awards in totaling to continue development work 
additionally  the acquisition of metro machine corp 
in added to the group s backlog for maintenance and repair services to be performed in norfolk  virginia 
the group also received a award in for the outfitting of the san antonio class amphibious assault dock ship lpd uss san diego  with an option for work on two additional ships 
information systems and technology logo the information systems and technology group s total backlog was billion at the end of  down slightly from billion at year end backlog was impacted in part by award delays stemming from recent continuing resolutions 
the group s backlog does not include approximately billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options 
in  funding under idiq contracts and options contributed over billion to the group s backlog  or over percent of the group s orders 
the estimated potential contract value in the information systems and technology group increased nearly percent from year end  most notably due to the billion chs contract award and the acquisition of vangent  inc  that added billion 
when combined  the group s backlog and estimated potential contract value increased by percent over to billion

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation 
this focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources to generate shareholder value while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities 
in  cash flows from operations exceeded net earnings for the th consecutive year 
the billion of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  repurchase our common stock  pay dividends and repay maturing debt 
our net debt  defined as debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities  was billion at year end  up by from at the end of largely due to the issuance of fixed rate notes in and continued capital deployment activities 
our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks  commercial paper rated a p or higher and short term repurchase agreements with direct obligations of the spanish government as collateral 
our marketable securities balances are invested primarily in term deposits and high quality corporate  municipal and us government sponsored debt securities 
the marketable securities have an average duration of one year and an average credit rating of aa 
we have not incurred any material losses associated with these investments 
on december   of our cash was held by international operations and is therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated 
while we do not intend to do so  should this amount be repatriated  it would be subject to us federal income tax but would generate partially offsetting foreign tax credits

we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and long term liquidity needs 
we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy 
the following is a discussion of our major operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three years  as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
operating activities we generated cash from operating activities of billion in  billion in and billion in in all three years  the operating cash flow was attributed primarily to net earnings 
in  operating cash flow also benefitted from customer deposits due upon receipt of provisional type certification of the g cash from operating activities reflects contributions to our pension plans  which have grown in recent years from in to in  with contributions of expected in termination of a program 
as discussed further in note n to the consolidated financial statements  litigation on the a program termination has been ongoing since if  contrary to our expectations  the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories  we  along with the boeing company  could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as billion for progress payments received for the a contract  plus interest  which was approximately billion on december  if this were the outcome  we would owe half of the total  or approximately billion pretax 
our after tax cash obligation would be approximately we believe we have sufficient resources  including access to capital markets  to pay such an obligation  if required 
investing activities we used billion in  in and billion in for investing activities 
the primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions  capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities 
investing activities also include proceeds received from the sale of assets and marketable securities 
business acquisitions 
in  we completed two acquisitions for in  we completed three acquisitions for in  we completed six acquisitions for billion 
we used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of acquisition activity 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were in  in and in the increase in compared with and is due largely to gulfstream s  seven year savannah  georgia  facilities expansion project announced in we expect capital expenditures of approximately in  or percent of anticipated revenues  as work on gulfstream s facilities project increases 
marketable securities 
as a result of lower market interest rates  we expanded our investment strategy several years ago to take advantage of the additional return generated by available for sale and held to maturity securities

table of contents dividends 
our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share on march   the th consecutive annual increase 
the board had previously approved a quarterly dividend of per share in march and per share in march share repurchases 
our board of directors has historically supported management s tactical repurchase of our shares  typically in repurchase authorizations of million share increments 
we repurchased million shares on the open market in  million shares in and million shares in as a result  we reduced our shares outstanding by percent in and nearly percent since on october   with no shares remaining under a prior authorization  the board authorized management to repurchase up to million shares  about percent of our total shares outstanding 
non gaap management metrics we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns 
as described below  we use free cash flow and return on invested capital roic to measure our ability to efficiently convert net earnings into cash and earn a return on the deployment of that capital 
free cash flow 
we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors  because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our operations for purposes such as repaying maturing debt  funding business acquisitions  repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends 
we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management 
over the past five years  we have generated free cash flow from operations in excess of our earnings from continuing operations during the period at an average percent conversion rate 
the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities  as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows year ended december net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow from operations cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities free cash flow from operations return on invested capital 
we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations 
we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management 
we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year 
net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after tax interest and amortization expense 
over the past five years  our roic has averaged percent 
roic is calculated as follows year ended december earnings from continuing operations after tax interest expense after tax amortization expense net operating profit after taxes average debt and equity return on invested capital general dynamics annual report

contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december  payments due by period contractual obligations total amount committed less than year years years more than years long term debt a capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations b other long term liabilities c a includes scheduled interest payments 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of long term debt 
b includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity  price and timing of delivery 
this amount includes billion of purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we have full recourse under normal contract termination clauses 
c represents other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  including the current portion of these liabilities 
the projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management s estimates  which are based largely on historical experience 
this amount also includes all liabilities under our defined benefit retirement plans  as discussed in note p 
see note p for information regarding the plan assets available to satisfy these liabilities 
amount of commitment expiration by period commercial commitments total amount committed less than year years years more than years letters of credit see note n to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of letters of credit 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our long term contracts and programs 
other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  workers compensation  warranty obligations  pre owned aircraft inventory  and commitments and contingencies 
we make our best estimates on historical and current experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 
we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application revenue recognition 
we account for revenues and earnings using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses  either as products are produced or as services are rendered 
we determine progress using either input measures general dynamics annual report 
table of contents eg  costs incurred or output measures eg  contract milestones or units delivered  as appropriate to the circumstances 
an input measure is used unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion 
we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract 
if at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract  we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified 
we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion input measure 
for our contracts for the manufacture of business jet aircraft we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered to  and accepted by  the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft output measure 
we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless a contract has been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors 
accounting for long term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs 
contract estimates are based on various assumptions that utilize the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers  program and operations managers and finance and accounting personnel to project the outcome of future events 
these events often span several years  including labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials  the performance of subcontractors  and the availability and timing of funding from the customer 
we include in our contract estimates claims against the customer for changes in specifications or other disputes when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable 
in evaluating these criteria  we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim  the cause of any additional costs incurred  the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim 
we include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee 
estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance 
these estimates are based on our best judgment at the time 
as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts  we review our performance monthly and update our contract estimates at least annually and often quarterly as well as when required by specific events or circumstances 
we recognize changes in estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method 
under the reallocation method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term 
we use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our long term contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods 
these changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and  therefore  the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned 
alternatively  most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catch up method 
as a result  the impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catch up method 
the net increase in our operating earnings from the quarterly impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled in and in  reflecting favorable operational performance across our contract portfolio 
other than revisions discussed in the aerospace and marine systems business groups results of operations  no revisions on any one contract were material 
goodwill and intangible assets 
since  we have acquired over businesses at a total cost of approximately billion  including six in in connection with these acquisitions  we have recognized billion and billion of goodwill and intangible assets  respectively 
goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management  particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
these estimates require the use of judgment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations 
this requires numerous assumptions  including the timing of work embedded in our backlog  our performance and profitability under our contracts  our success in securing future business and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows 
this discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by top down analyses  including a market assessment of our enterprise value 
we have recorded no goodwill impairment to date nor do we anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to impairment in the foreseeable future 
the fair value of each of our reporting units on december   exceeded its carrying value under the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
impairment losses  where identified  are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the long lived asset 
we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows 
we recorded an impairment loss in related to our completions business as discussed in the aerospace group s results of operations 
commitments and contingencies 
we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment 
we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is general dynamics annual report 
table of contents probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable 
the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
deferred contract costs 
certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not allocable currently to contracts 
such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation obligations  other insurance related assessments  pension and other post retirement benefits  and environmental expenses 
these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid 
we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts 
we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business  including existing backlog and probable follow on contracts 
our business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long term defense programs 
we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow on contracts 
this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs  the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity 
these estimates are based on our best judgment 
if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs  the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 
retirement plans 
our defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates 
the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long term rates of return on plan assets 
we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period 
we determine the long term rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy 
these estimates are based on our best judgment  including consideration of current and future market conditions 
in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted  pension and post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease 
for the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post retirement benefit plans  see note p to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed under deferred contract costs  our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans 
we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses 
accordingly  the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings either positively or negatively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and investments 
see note m to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item  of this annual report on form k for a discussion of these risks 
the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
we had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of billion on december   and billion on december  a percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax gains and losses gain loss recognized unrecognized this exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollar canadian dollar  euro canadian dollar and us dollar euro exchange rates 
we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments  when taken together  do not create material market risk 
interest rate risk 
our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate long term debt obligations and variable rate commercial paper 
on december   we had billion par value of fixed rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding 
our fixed rate debt obligations are not putable  and we do not trade these securities in the market 
a percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 
our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed income securities with an investment grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years 
on december   we held billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities  which had an aggregate weighted average maturity of less than two months on december  our marketable securities have an average duration of one year and an average credit rating of aa 
a percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the value of the holdings 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values
