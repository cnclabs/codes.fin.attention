you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis will help you understand who we are and the environment in which we operate  our operating highlights and recent developments  our critical accounting policies and estimates  our results of operations for the last three years  how we manage our assets and liabilities  our liquidity and capital resources  our cash flows  and our future contractual obligations 
corporate and operating environment we are a real estate investment trust reit with a geographically diverse portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare properties throughout the united states and canada 
as of december  
table of contents we owned  properties located in states  the district of columbia and two canadian provinces  consisting of seniors housing communities  skilled nursing facilities  hospitals  medical office buildings mobs  and eight personal care facilities 
we also were in the process of developing three properties as of december  we are headquartered in chicago  illinois and have been a constituent member of the s p index  a leading indicator of the large cap us equities market  since march our primary business focuses on acquiring and owning seniors housing and healthcare properties and leasing those properties to unaffiliated tenants or operating those properties through independent third party managers 
through our lillibridge healthcare services  inc lillibridge subsidiary and our ownership interest in pmb real estate services llc pmbres  which we acquired in july in connection with our acquisition of nationwide health properties  inc together with its subsidiaries  nhp  we also provide mob management  leasing  marketing  facility development and advisory services to highly rated hospitals and health systems throughout the united states 
in addition  from time to time  we make mortgage loan and other investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare companies or properties 
we currently operate through three reportable business segments triple net leased properties  senior living operations and mob operations 
see note segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
as of december   we had ownership interests in  properties  controlling interests in eleven mobs and eighteen seniors housing communities owned through joint ventures with third parties  and noncontrolling interests ranging between and in mobs  seniors housing communities and fourteen skilled nursing facilities owned through joint ventures with third parties 
through lillibridge and pmbres  we also provided management and leasing services to third parties with respect to mobs as of december  as of december   we leased properties excluding mobs to healthcare operating companies under triple net or absolute net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property related expenses  including maintenance  utilities  repairs  taxes  insurance and capital expenditures  and we engaged independent third parties  such as atria senior living  inc atria and sunrise senior living  inc together with its subsidiaries  sunrise  to manage seniors housing communities pursuant to long term management agreements 
kindred healthcare  inc together with its subsidiaries  kindred and brookdale senior living inc brookdale senior living leased and of our properties  respectively  as of december  excluding six properties included in investments in unconsolidated entities 
our business strategy focuses on three principal objectives generating consistent  reliable and growing cash flows  maintaining a well diversified portfolio  and preserving our financial strength  flexibility and liquidity

our access to and cost of capital depend on various factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on our securities  perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our common stock 
generally  we attempt to match the long term duration of our investments in senior housing and healthcare properties with long term financing through the issuance of shares of our common stock or the incurrence of fixed rate debt 
at december   only of our consolidated debt was variable rate debt excluding debt related to real estate assets classified as held for sale

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap set forth in the accounting standards codification asc  as published by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different  we may have applied a different accounting treatment  resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
we periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions  and in the event they prove to be different from actual results  we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the critical accounting policies described below  among others  affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for more information regarding our critical accounting policies  see note accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in 
table of contents consolidation  and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 
we apply fasb guidance for arrangements with variable interest entities vies  which requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
a vie is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics a the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support  b as a group  the holders of the equity investment at risk lack i the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting or similar rights  ii the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity  or iii the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity  or c the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests  and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve  or are conducted on behalf of  an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights 
we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
we may change our original assessment of a vie due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity s equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary 
we identify the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could be significant to the entity 
we perform this analysis on an ongoing basis 
we also apply fasb guidance related to investments in joint ventures based on the type of rights held by the limited partner s that may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances in which the general partner would otherwise consolidate the joint venture 
we assess limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner when an investor becomes the sole general partner  and we reassess if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners  ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests  or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests 
we also apply this guidance to managing member interests in limited liability companies 
business combinations we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method and allocate the cost of the properties acquired among tangible and recognized intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
recognized intangibles primarily include the value of in place leases  acquired lease contracts  tenant and customer relationships  trade names trademarks and goodwill 
we do not amortize goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business and is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
our method for allocating the purchase price to acquired investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this includes determining the value of the buildings  land and improvements  ground leases  tenant improvements  in place leases  above and or below market leases  purchase option intangible assets and or liabilities  and any debt assumed 
these estimates require significant judgment and in some cases involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments directly impact our results of operations  as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives 
in addition  we amortize the value assigned to above and or below market leases as a component of revenue  unlike in place leases and other intangibles  which we include in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents we estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building  not to exceed years 
we determine the allocated value of other fixed assets  such as site improvements and furniture  fixtures and equipment  based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over the assets estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the applicable acquisition date 
we determine the value of land by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions or based on a internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or b real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset 
the fair value of acquired lease intangibles  if any  reflects i the estimated value of any above and or below market leases  determined by discounting the difference between the estimated market rent and the in place rent  the resulting intangible asset or liability of which we amortize to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any bargain renewal periods  and ii the estimated value of in place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants  including leasing commissions  and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period as if the acquired space was vacant  which we amortize to amortization expense over the remaining life of the associated lease 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed  all unamortized amounts of lease intangibles would be recognized in operations at that time 
we estimate the fair value of purchase option intangible assets or liabilities by discounting the difference between the applicable property s acquisition date fair value and an estimate of the future option price 
we do not amortize the resulting intangible asset or liability over the term of the lease  but rather adjust the recognized value of the asset or liability upon exercise of the purchase option 
we estimate the fair value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired  if any  by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant or customer  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant or customer  the tenant s credit quality  expectations of lease renewals with the tenant  and the potential for significant  additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant and amortize that value over the expected life of the associated arrangements or leases  including the remaining terms of the related leases and any expected renewal periods 
we estimate the fair value of trade names trademarks using a royalty rate methodology and amortize that value over the estimated useful life of the trade name trademark 
in connection with a business combination  we may assume the rights and obligations under certain lease agreements pursuant to which we become the lessee of a given property 
we assume the lease classification previously determined by the prior lessee absent a modification in the assumed lease agreement 
in connection with our recent acquisitions  all capital leases acquired or assumed contain bargain purchase options that we intend to exercise 
therefore  we recognized an asset based on the acquisition date fair value of the underlying property and a liability based on the acquisition date fair value of the capital lease obligation 
we depreciate assets recognized under capital leases that contain bargain purchase options over the asset s useful life 
we assess assumed operating leases  including ground leases  to determine whether the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable given current market conditions on the acquisition date 
to the extent the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable relative to market conditions on the acquisition date  we recognize an intangible asset or liability  respectively  at fair value  and we amortize the recognized asset or liability excluding purchase option intangibles to interest or rental expense in our consolidated statements of income over the applicable lease term 
we include all lease related intangible assets and all lease related intangible liabilities within acquired lease intangibles and accounts payable and other liabilities  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents we determine fair value of loans receivable acquired in connection with a business combination by discounting the estimated future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with the same maturities and same terms would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings 
the estimated future cash flows reflect our judgment regarding the uncertainty of those cash flows  so we do not establish a valuation allowance at the acquisition date 
we recognize the difference between the acquisition date fair value and the total expected cash flows as interest income using an effective interest method over the life of the applicable loan 
subsequent to the acquisition date  we evaluate changes regarding the uncertainty of future cash flows and the need for a valuation allowance 
we estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests assumed using assumptions that are consistent with those used in valuing all of the underlying assets and liabilities 
we base the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities on the fair value of the assets at the time we acquired the joint venture interest 
we estimate fair values for our equity method investments based on discounted cash flow models that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and  where applicable  any estimated debt premiums or discounts 
the capitalization rates  discount rates and credit spreads we use in these models are based upon assumptions that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments 
we generally amortize any difference between our cost basis and the basis reflected at the joint venture level over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and include it in our share of income or loss from unconsolidated entities 
in other instances  net income or loss is allocated between the partners in the joint venture based on the hypothetical liquidation at book value method 
we calculate the fair value of long term debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings  which we approximate based on the rate we would expect to incur to replace the instrument on the date of acquisition  and recognize any fair value adjustments related to long term debt as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument 
we record a liability for contingent consideration included in accounts payable and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value as of the acquisition date and reassess the fair value at the end of each reporting period  with any changes being recognized in earnings 
increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration can result from changes in discount periods  discount rates and probabilities that contingencies will be met 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  primarily consisting of our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations 
in performing this evaluation  we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset 
we adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows  including sales proceeds  is less than book value 
we recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination 
if impairment indicators arise with respect to intangible assets with finite useful lives  we evaluate impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  then we estimate the fair value of the asset 
we determine the impairment loss by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value and recognize any shortfall from fair value as a loss in the current period 

table of contents we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture may exceed the fair value 
if it is determined that a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary  and if such reduced fair value is below its carrying value  an impairment is recorded 
the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment 
our estimates consider all available evidence  including  as appropriate  the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates  general economic conditions and trends and other relevant factors 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  but more frequently if indicators arise 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
qualitative factors we assess include current macroeconomic conditions  state of the equity and capital markets and our overall financial and operating performance 
if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we proceed with the two step approach to evaluating impairment 
in the first step of this approach  we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying value 
should the carrying value exceed fair value  we proceed with the second step 
the second step of this approach requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be assigned to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment 
we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value in the current period 
estimates of fair value used in this evaluation of goodwill  investments in real estate and intangibles are based upon discounted future cash flow projections  which are  in turn  based upon a number of estimates and assumptions  such as revenue and expense growth rates and discount rates 
our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 
loans receivable we record loans receivable  other than those acquired in connection with a business combination  on our consolidated balance sheets either in secured loans receivable  net or  with respect to unsecured loans receivable  other assets at the unpaid principal balance  net of any deferred origination fees  purchase discounts or premiums and valuation allowances 
we amortize net deferred origination fees  which are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs  and purchase discounts or premiums over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method and recognize any unamortized balances in income immediately if the loan is repaid before its contractual maturity 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of loans receivable based on several factors  including without limitation i corporate and facility level financial and operational reports  ii compliance with any financial covenants set forth in the applicable loan agreement  iii the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantor  iv the payment history of the borrower  and v current economic conditions 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the applicable loan agreement  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be collected 
fair value we follow fasb guidance that defines fair value and provides direction for measuring fair value and making the necessary related disclosures 
the guidance emphasizes that fair value is a market 
table of contents based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level three of the hierarchy 
level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access 
level two inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability 
level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as other inputs for the asset or liability  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates and yield curves  that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level three inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on the reporting entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
if the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the hierarchy  the level within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
if an entity determines there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability relative to the normal market activity for such asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities  then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value 
in addition  if there is evidence that the transaction for the asset or liability is not orderly  the entity shall place little  if any  weight on that transaction price as an indicator of fair value 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
revenue recognition triple net leased properties and mob operations certain of our triple net leases  including the majority of our leases with brookdale senior living and the majority of leases we acquired in connection with the nhp acquisition  and most of our mob leases provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent 
we recognize base rental revenues under these leases on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured 
recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenues during the first half of a lease term exceeding the cash amounts contractually due from our tenants  creating a straight line rent receivable that is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
our master lease agreements with kindred the kindred master leases and certain of our other leases provide for periodic increases in base rent only if certain revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met 
we recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases as the related parameters or contingencies are met  rather than on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term 
senior living operations we recognize resident fees and services  other than move in fees  monthly as services are provided 
we recognize move in fees on a straight line basis over the average resident stay 
our lease agreements with residents generally have a term of twelve to eighteen months and are cancelable by the resident upon days notice 

table of contents other we recognize interest income from loans  including discounts and premiums  using the effective interest method when collectibility is reasonably assured 
we apply the effective interest method on a loan by loan basis and recognize discounts and premiums as yield adjustments over the related loan term 
we recognize interest income on an impaired loan to the extent our estimate of the fair value of the collateral is sufficient to support the balance of the loan  other receivables and all related accrued interest 
when the balance of the loan  other receivables and all related accrued interest is equal to our estimate of the fair value of the collateral  we recognize interest income on a cash basis 
we provide a reserve against an impaired loan to the extent our total investment in the loan exceeds our estimate of the fair value of the loan collateral 
we recognize income from rent  lease termination fees  development services  management advisory services and all other income when all of the following criteria are met in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin i the applicable agreement has been fully executed and delivered  ii services have been rendered  iii the amount is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowances we assess the collectibility of our rent receivables  including straight line rent receivables  in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and our reserve policy  and we defer recognition of revenue if collectibility is not reasonably assured 
we base our assessment of the collectibility of rent receivables excluding straight line receivables on several factors  including  among other things  payment history  the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors  the value of the underlying collateral  if any  and current economic conditions 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to recover the full value of the receivable  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be recovered 
we base our assessment of the collectibility of straight line receivables on several factors  including  among other things  the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors  the historical operations and operating trends of the property  the historical payment pattern of the tenant  and the type of property 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to receive the rent payments due in the future  we defer recognition of the straight line rental income and  in certain circumstances  provide a reserve against the previously recognized straight line rent receivable asset for a portion  up to its full value  that we estimate may not be recovered 
if we change our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of future rent payments required by a lease  we may adjust our reserve to increase or reduce the rental revenue recognized and or to increase or reduce the reserve against the existing straight line rent receivable 
federal income tax we have elected to be treated as a reit under the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  for every year beginning with the year ended december  and made no provision for federal income tax purposes prior to our acquisition of the assets of sunrise senior living real estate investment trust sunrise reit in april as a result of the sunrise reit and subsequent acquisitions  we now record income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of our entities that are taxed as taxable reit subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the reit provisions 
we account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
table of contents using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances  and that causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events  is included in the tax provision when such changes occur 
deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances  and that causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset  is included in the tax provision when such changes occur 
recently issued or adopted accounting standards in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  derecognition of in substance real estate a scope clarification asu  which clarifies certain guidance for situations in which a reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is  in substance  real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary s nonrecourse debt 
in such situations  asu requires a company to apply the provisions of asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  in determining whether it should derecognize the real estate assets 
the provisions of asu will be effective for us beginning with fiscal year  and are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment asu  which permits companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing the current two step analysis 
if a company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the company must proceed with the two step approach to evaluating impairment 
we adopted the provisions of asu in  and the adoption did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
also  on january   we adopted asu  when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts asu 
asu states that if a reporting unit has a carrying amount that is equal to or less than zero and there are qualitative factors that indicate it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed 
the adoption of asu also did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income asu  which amends current guidance found in asc topic  comprehensive income 
asu requires entities to present comprehensive income in either i one continuous financial statement or ii two separate but consecutive statements that display net income and the components of other comprehensive income 
totals and individual components of both net income and other comprehensive income must be included in either presentation 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu 
the provisions of asu indefinitely defer portions of asu related to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the provisions of both asu and asu will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter of on january   we adopted asu  disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu  affecting public entities that enter into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
asu specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  it should disclose revenues and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the year had occurred at the beginning of the prior annual reporting period when preparing the pro forma financial information 
table of contents for both the current and prior reporting periods 
the guidance  which is effective for business combinations consummated in reporting periods beginning after december   also requires that pro forma disclosures be accompanied by a narrative description regarding the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination s included in reported pro forma revenues and earnings 
we have presented supplementary pro forma information related to our acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets and working capital of aslg in may and our acquisition of nhp in july in note acquisitions of real estate property included in item of this annual report on form k 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which expands required disclosures related to an entity s fair value measurements 
certain provisions of asu were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   and we adopted those provisions as of january  the remaining provisions  which were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   require additional disclosures related to purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in an entity s reconciliation of recurring level three investments 
we adopted those provisions of asu as of january  the adoption of asu did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations as of december   we operated through three reportable business segments triple net leased properties  senior living operations and mob operations 
our triple net leased properties segment consists of acquiring and owning seniors housing and healthcare properties in the united states and leasing those properties to healthcare operating companies under triple net or absolute net leases that require the tenants to pay all property related expenses 
our senior living operations segment primarily consists of investments in seniors housing communities located in the united states and canada for which we engage independent third parties  such as atria and sunrise  to manage the operations 
our mob operations segment primarily consists of acquiring  owning  developing  leasing and managing mobs 
information provided for all other includes revenues such as income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income and various corporate level expenses not directly attributable to our three reportable business segments

net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  net of tax primarily represents sunrise s share of net income from its previous ownership percentage in of our seniors housing communities during and of our seniors housing communities during most of non gaap financial measures we believe that net income  as defined by gaap  is the most appropriate earnings measurement 
however  we consider certain non gaap financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance 
a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows  but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable gaap measure 
set forth below are descriptions of the non gaap financial measures we consider most relevant to our business and useful to investors  as well as reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
the non gaap financial measures we present herein are not necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions 
these measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with gaap as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as measures of our liquidity  nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
funds from operations and normalized funds from operations historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values  instead  have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
to overcome this problem  we consider funds from operations ffo and normalized ffo appropriate measures of operating performance of an equity reit 
moreover  we believe that normalized ffo provides useful information because it allows investors  analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and other events such as transactions and litigation 
we use the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we define normalized ffo as ffo excluding the following income and expense items which may be recurring in nature a gains and losses on the sales of real property assets  b merger related costs and expenses  including amortization of intangibles and transition and integration expenses  and deal costs and expenses  including expenses and recoveries relating to our lawsuit against hcp and the issuance of preferred stock or bridge loan fees  c the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances  the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees  or additional costs  expenses  discounts  make whole payments

our ffo and normalized ffo for the five years ended december  are summarized in the following table 
our ffo for the year ended december  increased over the prior year primarily due to the nhp and aslg acquisitions  higher noi from our senior living operations and mob operations reportable business segments  net litigation proceeds and income tax benefit  partially offset by increased merger related expenses and deal costs  general  administrative and professional fees and interest expense due to our enterprise growth

table of contents another indication of our ability to service debt 
we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization including non cash stock based compensation expense  excluding loss on extinguishment of debt  net litigation proceeds  merger related expenses and deal costs  gains or losses on sales of real property assets and changes in the fair value of financial instruments including amounts in discontinued operations

table of contents asset liability management asset liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program 
the objective of asset liability management is to support the achievement of our business strategy  while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
our asset liability management process focuses on a variety of risks  including without limitation market risk primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of our ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and million term loan facility  floating rate mortgage debt and certain mortgage loans receivable 
these market risks result primarily from changes in libor or prime rates 
we continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including our assessment of the current and future economic environment 

table of contents the table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt  excluding premiums  discounts and capital lease obligations 
as of december  dollars in thousands balance fixed rate senior notes and other mortgage loans and other variable rate unsecured revolving credit facilities unsecured term loan facility mortgage loans and other total percent of total debt fixed rate senior notes and other mortgage loans and other variable rate unsecured revolving credit facilities unsecured term loan facility mortgage loans and other total weighted average interest rate at end of period fixed rate senior notes and other mortgage loans and other variable rate unsecured revolving credit facilities unsecured term loan facility n a n a mortgage loans and other total the amounts presented above exclude debt related to real estate assets classified as held for sale as of december  the total mortgage debt for these properties as of december  was million 
the variable rate debt in the table above reflects  in part  the effect of million notional amount of interest rate swaps with a maturity of february  that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
the increase in our outstanding variable rate debt from december  is primarily attributable to debt assumed in connection with the aslg and nhp acquisitions  borrowings under our variable rate term loan facility and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants  if interest rates increase on certain variable rate debt that we have totaling million as of december   our tenant is required to pay us additional rent on a dollar for dollar basis in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates 
therefore  the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant 
assuming a basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our variable rate debt excluding debt related to real estate assets classified as held for sale at december   and 
table of contents assuming no change in our variable rate debt outstanding as of december   interest expense for would increase  and our net income would decrease  by approximately million  or per diluted common share 
the fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate fluctuations generally affect the fair value  but do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
therefore  interest rate risk does not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt obligations until such obligations mature or we elect to prepay and refinance them 
if interest rates have risen at the time our fixed rate debt matures or is refinanced  our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs 
conversely  lower interest rates at the time of maturity or refinancing may lower our overall borrowing costs 
to highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  and as of december  in thousands gross book value fair value fair value reflecting change in interest rates bps bps the change in fair value of our fixed rate debt was due primarily to the overall change in interest rates and the assumption of debt in connection with the aslg and nhp acquisitions 
we earn interest from investments in marketable debt securities on a fixed rate basis 
we record these investments as available for sale at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
interest rate fluctuations and market conditions will cause the fair value of these investments to change 
as of december  and  the aggregate fair value of our marketable debt securities held at december   which had an aggregate original cost of million  was million and million  respectively 
during  we sold marketable debt securities and received proceeds of approximately million 
as of december   the fair value of our secured and unsecured loans receivable  based on our estimates of currently prevailing interest rates for comparable loans  was million 
see note loans receivable and note fair values of financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we are subject to fluctuations in us and canadian exchange rates that may  from time to time  affect our financial condition and results of operations 
increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our twelve seniors housing communities in canada 
based solely on our results  if the canadian dollar exchange rate were to increase or decrease by  our net income from these communities would decrease or increase  as applicable  by million per year 
if we increase our international presence through investments in  or acquisitions or development of  seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the united states  we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility in currencies other than us or canadian dollars 
although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives including additional borrowings in local currencies to protect against foreign currency fluctuations  we cannot provide any assurance that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity  on our ability to 
table of contents service our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders  as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit a material adverse effect 
we may engage in hedging strategies to manage our exposure to market risks in the future  depending on an analysis of the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate environments and the costs and risks of such strategies 
however  we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
concentration and credit risk we use concentration ratios to understand and evaluate the potential risks of economic downturns or other adverse events affecting our various asset types  geographic locations  business models  or tenants  operators and managers 
we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of investment mix  which measures the portion of our investments that consists of a certain asset type or that is operated or managed by a particular tenant  operator or manager  and operations mix  which measures the portion of our operating results that is attributed to a certain tenant or operator  geographic location or business model

we derive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
some of our triple net lease escalators are tied to the consumer price index cpi  with caps  floors or collars

our reliance on kindred and brookdale senior living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income creates credit risk 
our financial condition and results of operations could be weakened and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders could be limited if either kindred or brookdale senior living was unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations to us 
in addition  any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation or its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties  which could have a material adverse effect on us
