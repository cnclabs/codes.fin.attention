item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report 
the following discussion may contain forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed under the headings risk factors and forward looking statements 
overview we develop  manufacture and sell healthcare products for use in clinical and home settings 
our mission is to create and deliver innovative healthcare solutions  developed in ethical collaboration with medical professionals  which enhance the quality of life for patients and improve outcomes for our customers and our shareholders 
our three reportable segments are as follows medical devices includes the development  manufacture and sale of endomechanical instruments  energy devices  soft tissue repair products  vascular products  oximetry and monitoring products  airway and ventilation products and other medical products 
pharmaceuticals includes the development  manufacture and distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals  active pharmaceutical ingredients  contrast products and radiopharmaceuticals 
medical supplies includes the development  manufacture and sale of nursing care products  medical surgical products  sharpsafety products and original equipment manufacturer oem products 
effective june   covidien became the parent company owning the former healthcare businesses of tyco international ltd 
on june   tyco international distributed all of our shares  as well as the shares of its former electronics businesses te connectivity ltd  to tyco international shareholders 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in us dollars  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
separation of our pharmaceuticals business in december  we announced a plan to spin off our pharmaceuticals business into a stand alone public company 
we anticipate that the transaction will be in the form of a distribution that will be tax free to us shareholders of a new publicly traded stock in the new pharmaceuticals company 
completion of the transaction is expected to be subject to certain conditions  including  among others  receipt of regulatory approvals  assurance as to the tax free status of the spin off of the pharmaceuticals business to our us shareholders  the effectiveness of a form registration statement to be filed with the us securities and exchange commission and final approval by our board of directors 
we currently expect to complete the transaction in june  however  there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed transaction or that the transaction will be completed 
subsequent to the separation  the historical results of our pharmaceuticals segment will be presented as discontinued operations 
healthcare reform in march  the patient protection and affordable care act was enacted in the united states 
this legislation includes a provision that imposes a excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices by a manufacturer  producer or importer of such devices in the united states starting after december  the legislation also includes a billion fee on the branded pharmaceutical industry over nine years starting in and a billion annual fee on branded pharmaceuticals thereafter 
the amount of branded pharmaceutical fee payable by each company is based upon market share 
since our branded pharmaceutical sales currently represent a small portion of the total market  this annual assessment has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
we estimate that the medical devices tax  however  will increase our selling  general and administrative expenses by between and million annually  beginning in our second quarter of fiscal strategic acquisitions  licensing agreements and divestitures we regularly engage in strategic reviews of our businesses to improve operations  financial returns and alignment between our businesses and our strategy 
we have made strategic acquisitions and divestitures in the past and we will continue to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses  including licensing and distribution transactions and selective acquisitions  as well as divestitures of non strategic and or underperforming businesses

during fiscal  we issued billion of debt for net proceeds of billion  which we used to finance a portion of our acquisition of ev in addition  during fiscal  we received net proceeds of million under our commercial paper program 
share repurchases and option exercises we repurchased approximately million shares for million in fiscal  million shares for million in fiscal and million shares for million in fiscal under our share buyback programs 
we also repurchase shares from certain employees in order to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements in connection with the vesting of restricted shares and to settle certain option exercises 
we spent million  million and million to acquire shares in connection with these share based awards during fiscal  and  respectively 
share repurchases were somewhat offset by proceeds from options exercises of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
dividend payments dividend payments were million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect our cash dividend payments to increase in fiscal as a result of the increase in our quarterly dividend rate discussed in dividends 
we returned   and of our operating cash flow to shareholders during fiscal  and  respectively  through a combination of both dividend payments and share repurchases 
during fiscal  and  free cash flow returned to shareholders was   and  respectively 
free cash flow  a non gaap measure  represents the cash that we have available to pursue opportunities that we believe enhance shareholder value 
management uses this non gaap financial measure  in addition to gaap financial measures  to evaluate our operating results 
it is also one of the performance metrics that determines management incentive compensation 
this non gaap financial measure should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities the most comparable gaap measure and free cash flow is as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow capitalization shareholders equity was billion  or per share  at september   compared with billion  or per share  at september  the increase in shareholders equity was primarily due to net income of billion and share options exercised of million  partially offset by the repurchase of shares of million and dividends declared of million during fiscal 
table of contents the following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the end of each fiscal year dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents current maturities of long term debt long term debt total debt shareholders equity debt to total capital ratio on may   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due may and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by both covidien plc and covidien ltd 
the net proceeds of approximately billion were used to fund the redemption of all of our outstanding million senior notes due october and for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the redemption of our senior notes  we recorded a million loss on early retirement of debt in other income  net during fiscal we have a billion five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility  which expires in august in addition  we may increase this facility by up to million to a maximum of billion provided certain borrowing conditions are met 
we are required to maintain an available unused balance under our billion revolving credit facility sufficient to support amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program 
we had million and million of commercial paper outstanding at september  and september   respectively 
no amount was outstanding under our credit facility at the end of either period 
our credit facility agreement contains a covenant limiting our ratio of debt to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  the agreement contains other customary covenants  none of which we consider restrictive to our operations 
we are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
dividends on september   our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from per share to per share 
the dividend  which totaled million  was paid on november  to shareholders of record on october  the timing  declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our ordinary shares falls within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including the statutory requirements of irish law  our earnings and financial condition  the capital requirements of our businesses  industry practice and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant 
share repurchase programs we repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time based on market conditions  our cash flows and net debt level to offset dilution related to equity compensation plans or to utilize excess cash to enhance shareholder value 
during fiscal and  we completed our billion share repurchase program and our million share repurchase program  respectively 
in august  our board of directors authorized a billion share repurchase program 
as of september   million remained outstanding under this program 

table of contents commitments and contingencies contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt  minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at september  is presented in the following table 
dollars in millions total thereafter debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations contingent consideration total contractual cash obligations interest on debt and capital lease obligations are projected for future periods using interest rates in effect as of september  certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates 
purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements 
the table above does not include other liabilities of billion  primarily consisting of obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans  unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest and penalties  environmental liabilities  insurable liabilities and obligations under our deferred compensation plan  because the timing of their future cash outflow is uncertain 
the most significant of these liabilities are discussed below 
as of september   we had net unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations of million and million  respectively 
while the timing and amounts of long term funding requirements for pension and postretirement obligations are uncertain  in fiscal we expect to make contributions of million and million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding our retirement plans  including the related assumptions 
we have billion of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and million of related accrued interest and penalties 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes  including unrecognized tax benefits 
we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites 
these projects relate to a variety of activities  including decontamination and decommissioning of radioactive materials and removal of solvents  metals and other hazardous substances from soil and groundwater 
the ultimate cost of cleanup and timing of future cash flows is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 
as of september   we believe that it is probable that we will incur investigation and remedial costs  including asset retirement obligations  of approximately million  of which million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and million is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at september  note to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding environmental matters  including asset retirement obligations 
legal proceedings we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including patent infringement claims  product liability matters  environmental matters  employment disputes  disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes 
we believe that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time 
although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings  based upon our experience  current information and applicable law  we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial condition 
however  one or more of the proceedings could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a future period 
further information regarding our legal proceedings is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements and in item legal proceedings 

table of contents guarantees we have guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and te connectivity  which relate to certain contingent tax liabilities 
we assumed and are responsible for of these liabilities 
current and non current liabilities totaling million and million relating to these guarantees were included on our consolidated balance sheet at september  and september   respectively 
during fiscal and  we made payments totaling million and million  respectively  to tyco international and te connectivity  which represents the reimbursement required pursuant to the tax sharing agreement for applicable tax and interest payments made by tyco international and te connectivity 
in disposing of assets or businesses  we often provide representations  warranties and indemnities to cover various risks  including unknown damage to the assets  environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate  liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities  and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition 
except as discussed below  we generally do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in connection with the sale of our specialty chemicals business  we provided the purchaser with an indemnification for various risks  including environmental  health  safety  tax and other matters  some of which have an indefinite term 
however  the most significant portion of this indemnification relates to environmental  health and safety matters  which has a term of years 
a liability of million relating to this indemnification was included on our consolidated balance sheet at both september  and september  the value of the environmental  health and safety guarantee was measured based on the probability weighted present value of the costs expected to be incurred to address environmental claims proposed under the indemnity 
as of september   the maximum future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification provided to the purchaser is million 
in addition  we were required to pay million into an escrow account as collateral  of which million remained in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet at september  we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities 
in addition  we are liable for product performance  however in the opinion of management  such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we are required to provide the nuclear regulatory commission financial assurance demonstrating our ability to cover the cost of decommissioning our maryland heights  missouri radiopharmaceuticals production facility upon closure 
we have provided this financial assurance in the form of a million surety bond 
in addition  we had various other outstanding letters of credit and guarantee totaling million as of september  income taxes at september   we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for billion of contingent tax liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  of which billion relates to periods prior to our separation from tyco international and which is shared with tyco international and te connectivity pursuant to the tax sharing agreement 
however  the actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the tax sharing agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters  some of which may not be resolved for several years 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the tax sharing agreement  we have recorded a receivable from tyco international and te connectivity of million as of september   substantially all of which is non current 
this amount primarily reflects of our contingent tax liabilities that are subject to the tax sharing agreement 
if tyco international and te connectivity default on their obligations to us under the tax sharing agreement  however  we would be liable for the entire amount of such liabilities 
additional information regarding the tax sharing agreement is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents  derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable 
we invest our excess cash in deposits or money market funds and diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions that have at least an a credit rating 
counterparties to our derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least a moody s and standard poor s long term debt rating of a a while we do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments  we minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions and actively monitoring outstanding positions 

table of contents concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are generally limited due to our large number of customers and their diversity across many geographic areas 
a portion of our trade accounts receivable outside the united states  however  include sales to government owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries  which are subject to payment delays 
payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries national economies 
deteriorating credit and economic conditions in parts of western europe  particularly in spain  italy and portugal  may continue to increase the average length of time it takes us to collect our accounts receivable in certain regions within these countries 
we routinely evaluate all government receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices 
while we have not incurred significant losses on government receivables  if the financial condition of customers or the countries healthcare systems continue to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments is uncertain  charges may be required in future periods 
our aggregate accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  in spain  italy and portugal and as a percent of our total outstanding accounts receivable at the end of each fiscal year are as follows dollars in millions accounts receivable  net in spain  italy and portugal percentage of total accounts receivable  net net sales to customers in spain  italy and portugal totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
at the end of june  we collected million from the spanish government  which related to and prior invoices 
as of september   million of the accounts receivable  net in spain  italy and portugal were over days past due 
contingent consideration in connection with certain of our acquisitions  we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue  regulatory or commercialization based milestones 
as of the respective acquisition dates  we recorded contingent liabilities representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired businesses 
we remeasure these liabilities each reporting period and record changes in the fair value in our consolidated statements of income 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or changes in the expected probability and timing of achieving regulatory or commercialization milestones  as well as changes in discount rates 
during fiscal and  we recorded expense of million and million  respectively  representing the increases in the estimated fair value of these obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from us to the buyer  which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site  based on contract terms or legal requirements in non us jurisdictions 
we sell products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers 
rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in accordance with a contract between us and the end user customer 
provisions for rebates  as well as sales discounts and returns  are accounted for as a reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in the reserve for returns  rebates and sales allowances within accounts receivable trade on our consolidated balance sheets 
we estimate rebates based on sales terms  historical experience and trend analyses 
in estimating rebates  we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor s rebate claim  distributor specific trend analyses  contractual commitments  including stated rebate rates  and other relevant information 
we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience  and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment 
historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been 
table of contents significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future 
rebates charged against gross sales in fiscal  and amounted to billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
intangible assets intangible assets primarily consist of completed technology  customer relationships  trademarks and in process research and development 
we record intangible assets at cost and amortize certain of such assets using the straight line method over ten to forty years 
we review intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the assets  estimated using an income approach  with their carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the present value of future cash flows 
we assess the remaining useful life and the recoverability of finite lived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually 
goodwill in performing goodwill assessments  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated 
we calculate our goodwill valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit 
this approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates  discount factors and income tax rates 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
we test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
we utilize a two step approach 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units through internal analyses and valuation  using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
to determine the implied fair value of goodwill  we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
the results of our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal showed that the fair value of each of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values 
contingencies we are involved  both as a plaintiff and a defendant  in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business  including  without limitation  patent infringement  product liability and environmental matters  as further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings  self insurance and other claims are based on judgment  the probability of losses and  where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates 
when a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made  we record the minimum loss contingency amount 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period  as additional information is available 
when we are initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  we record the minimum amount of loss  which could be zero 
as information becomes known  additional loss provision is recorded when either a best estimate can be made or the minimum loss amount is increased 
when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected  our best estimate is changed to a lower amount 
we record receivables from third party insurers when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement 
in making this determination  we consider applicable deductibles  policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans 
for our us plans  we use a broad population of moody s aa rated corporate bonds to determine the discount rate assumption 
all bonds are non callable  denominated in us dollars and have a minimum amount outstanding of million 
this population of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve  to discount the projected benefit payments for the us plans 
the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 
for our non us plans  the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and region specific government and corporate bond interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present 
table of contents value of pension obligations by approximately million 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
guarantees we have guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and te connectivity  which relate to certain contingent tax liabilities 
these arrangements were valued upon separation from tyco international using appraisals and a liability related to these guarantees was recorded 
each reporting period  we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable 
to the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount of the liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  an adjustment is recorded to increase the liability to the amount of such potential loss 
to date  this guarantee has not been amortized into income because there has been no predictable pattern of performance 
as a result  the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations  which may not occur for some years  or  as payments are made to indemnified parties 
we consider the impact of such payments in our periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability 
in addition  we have  from time to time  provided guarantees and indemnifications to unrelated parties 
these guarantees have not been material to our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these guarantees relates to an indemnification  which we provided to the purchaser of our specialty chemicals business  primarily related to environmental  health  safety  tax and other matters 
as of september   we have a liability of million on our consolidated balance sheet related to this indemnification  however  we could be required to make payments of up to million 
we periodically reassess our exposure and potential loss under these arrangements  and  in the event that an increase in the fair value of the guarantee occurs  a charge to income will be required 
income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes  we must make estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and international pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
the tax benefit of any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon resolution of the uncertainty 
to the extent a full benefit is not realized on the uncertain tax position  an income tax liability is established 
we adjust these liabilities as a result of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
a significant portion of our potential tax liabilities are recorded in non current income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes  however  which would have a material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have recorded significant valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions  which we intend to maintain until it appears to be more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets will be realized 
our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of billion and billion at september  and september   respectively  relate principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets  primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 
included in the valuation allowance at september  and september  is billion and billion  respectively  substantially all of which represents a full valuation allowance against certain non us net operating losses recorded in fiscal as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling 
it is highly unlikely that any of this net operating loss will be utilized 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the tax benefits related to the net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  any reduction in future taxable income  including any future restructuring activities  may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our 
table of contents deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
our income tax expense recorded in the future may also be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to goodwill impairment testing 
this amendment permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
we are required to comply with this amendment beginning in the first quarter of fiscal in july  the fasb issued an amendment related to testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this amendment provides companies with the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired  it is required to determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value 
if the company concludes otherwise  no further quantitative assessment is required 
we are required to comply with this amendment beginning in the first quarter of fiscal forward looking statements we have made forward looking statements in this report that are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management 
forward looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations  business strategies  financing plans  competitive position  potential growth opportunities  potential operating performance improvements  the effects of competition  and the effects of future legislation or regulations 
forward looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as the words believe  expect  plan  intend  anticipate  estimate  predict  potential  continue  may  should or the negative of these terms or similar expressions 
forward looking statements involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
you should not put undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
the risk factors discussed in risk factors could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
there may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material effect on our business 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward looking statements other than as required by law 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
in order to manage the volatility to our more significant market risks  we enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts 
foreign currency exposures foreign currency risk arises from our investments in affiliates and subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 
such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the united states 
we use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts on accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable  intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies 
based on a sensitivity analysis of our existing contracts  a appreciation of the us dollar from market rates would increase the unrealized value of contracts on our consolidated balance sheet by million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
a depreciation of the us dollar would decrease the unrealized value of contracts on our consolidated balance sheet by million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
however  such gains or losses on these contracts would ultimately be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions
