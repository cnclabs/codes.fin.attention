from through the fhlb of chicago suspended the payment of dividends on its common stock  as well as the repurchase of common stock from its members  including the bank 
the fhlb of chicago resumed the payment of quarterly cash dividends in the original suspension was due to the fhlb of chicago entering into a memorandum of understanding with its primary regulator the fhfa which  among other things  restricted the dividends that the fhlb of chicago could pay without prior approval of the fhfa  as well as the stock that it can repurchase from its members

deposit insurance the deposit accounts held by customers of the bank are insured by the fdic up to maximum limits  as provided by law 
insurance on deposits may be terminated by the fdic if it finds that the bank has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic or the occ 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition  or violation that might lead to termination of the bank s deposit insurance 
the fdic sets deposit insurance premiums based upon the risks a particular bank or savings association poses to its deposit insurance funds 
under the risk based assessment system  the fdic assigns an institution to one of three capital categorizations based on the institution s financial information 
with respect to these three categorizations  institutions are classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized using ratios that are substantially similar to the prompt corrective action capital ratios discussed above 
the fdic also assigns an institution to one of three supervisory sub categorizations within each capital group 
this assignment is based on a supervisory evaluation provided by the institution s primary federal regulator and information that the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund 
an institution s assessment rate depends on the capital categorizations and supervisory sub categorizations to which it is assigned 
under the risk based assessment system  there are then four assessment risk categories to which different assessment rates are applied refer to the next paragraph for a description of these assessment rates 
any increase in insurance assessments could have an adverse effect on the earnings of insured institutions  including the bank 
effective in april the fdic implemented a final rule as required by the dodd frank act that changed the definition of a financial institution s deposit insurance assessment base and revises the deposit insurance risk based assessment rate schedule  among other things 
under the new rule the assessment base changed from an insured institution s domestic deposits minus certain allowable exclusions to an insured institution s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity and certain other adjustments 
in addition  the assessment rates were established in a range of to basis points  depending on the institution s capital category and supervisor sub category  as previously described 
for additional discussion  refer to results of operations non interest expense in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the fdic imposed a one time special assessment against insured financial institutions in order to bolster its insurance reserves 
for additional discussion  refer to results of operations non interest expense in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the fdic also required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly deposit insurance assessments through accordingly  in the company prepaid million in deposit insurance premiums related to the years to this prepaid amount was million as of december   and was recorded as a component of other assets in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
this amount will be continue to be charged to expense in future periods as the company receives quarterly statements for fdic deposit insurance assessments 
in the fdic created the transaction account guarantee program tagp  which provided participating banks with full deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts  regardless of dollar amount through december  the dodd frank act subsequently extended this insurance coverage on a broader basis through december  as such  the bank s non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts are fully insured under this program  which has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on the deposit insurance premiums paid by the bank 
transactions with affiliates sections a and b of the federal reserve act govern transactions between an insured federal savings association  such as the bank  and any of its affiliates  such as the company 
frb regulation w comprehensively implements and interprets sections a and b 
an affiliate is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with it 
a subsidiary of a savings association that is not also a depository institution or a financial subsidiary is not treated as an affiliate  however  the occ may treat subsidiaries as affiliates on a case by case basis 
sections a and b limit the extent to which an institution or a subsidiary may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such savings association s capital stock and surplus  and limit all such transactions with all affiliates to of such stock and surplus 
all such transactions must be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the term covered transaction includes the making of loans  purchase of assets  issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions 
in addition  the dodd frank act expanded covered transactions to include derivatives transactions and securities borrowing and lending transactions to the extent that they result in credit exposure to an affiliate 
further  most loans by a savings association to any of its affiliates must be secured by specified collateral amounts 
in addition  any covered transaction by a savings association with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by an savings association from an affiliate must be on terms that are at least as favorable to the savings association as those that would be provided to a non affiliate 
at december   the company and bank did not have any covered transactions 
acquisitions and mergers under the federal bank merger act  any merger of the bank with or into another institution would require the approval of the occ  or the primary federal regulator of the resulting entity if it is not an occ regulated institution 
refer also to regulation and supervision of the company acquisition of bank mutual corporation  below 
prohibitions against tying arrangements savings associations are subject to the prohibitions of usc section on certain tying arrangements 
a savings association is prohibited  subject to exceptions  from extending credit to or offering any other service  or fixing or varying the consideration for such credit or service  on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor 
uniform real estate lending standards the federal banking agencies adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing the construction of a building or other improvements to real estate 
under the joint regulations  all insured depository institutions must adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for such extensions of credit 
these policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards  prudent underwriting standards that are clear and measurable  loan administration procedures  and documentation  approval and reporting requirements 
these lending policies must reflect consideration of the interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies that have been adopted by the federal bank regulators 
the interagency guidelines  among other things  require a depository institution to establish internal loan to value limits for real estate loans that are not in excess of the following supervisory limits for loans secured by raw land  the supervisory loan to value limit is of the value of the collateral  for land development loans ie  loans for the purpose of improving unimproved property prior to the erection of structures   for loans for the construction of commercial  multi family or other non residential property   for loans for the construction of one to four family properties   and for loans secured by other improved property eg  farmland  completed commercial property and other income producing property  including non owner occupied  one to four family property  
although there is no supervisory loan to value limit for owner occupied one to four family and home equity loans  the interagency guidelines provide that an institution should require credit enhancement in the form of mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral for any such loan with a loan to value ratio that equals or exceeds at origination  including an update that provided additional clarification as to expectations for prudent appraisal and evaluation policies  procedures  and practices in light of the dodd frank act and other federal statutory changes affecting appraisals 
community reinvestment act under the community reinvestment act cra  any insured depository institution  including the bank  must  consistent with its safe and sound operation  help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
the cra requires the occ to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution  including applications for additional branches and acquisitions 
among other things  the cra regulations contain an evaluation system that rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs 
in particular  the evaluation system focuses on three tests a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its service areas  an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of making community development investments  and a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches  atms and other offices 
the cra requires the occ  in the case of the bank  to provide a written evaluation of a savings association s cra performance utilizing a four tiered descriptive rating system and requires public disclosure of the cra rating 
the bank received a satisfactory overall rating in its most recent cra examination 
safety and soundness standards each federal banking agency  including the occ  has guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls  information and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  customer privacy  liquidity  earnings  and compensation and benefits 
the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines also prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice 
loans to insiders a savings association s loans to its executive officers  directors  any owner of more than of its stock each  an insider and certain entities affiliated with any such person an insider s related interest are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by section h of the federal reserve act and the frb s regulation o thereunder 
under these restrictions  the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans to one borrower limit applicable to national banks comparable to the limit applicable to the bank s loans 
all loans by a savings association to all insiders and related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the savings association s unimpaired capital and surplus 
with certain exceptions  loans to an executive officer other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence may not exceed the greater of  or of the savings association s unimpaired capital and surplus  but in no event more than  regulation o also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the savings association  without the vote of any interested director  if such loan  when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests  would exceed either  or the greater of  or of the savings association s unimpaired capital and surplus 
generally  such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than  those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not present more than a normal risk of collectability 
there is an exception for extensions of credit pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a savings association that is widely available to employees that does not give preference to officers  directors  and other insiders 
as of december   total loans to insiders were  including  which relates to residential mortgages that have been sold in the secondary market 
the patriot act the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of the patriot act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures and surveillance powers  increased information sharing  and broadened anti money laundering requirements 
title iii of the patriot act encourages information sharing among regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies and imposes affirmative obligations on a range of financial institutions  including savings associations 
title iii s provisions affecting financial institutions include requirements related to anti money laundering programs  minimum standards with respect to customer identification  controls on and policies relating to private banking accounts or correspondent accounts in the united states for non united states persons or their representatives including foreign individuals visiting the united states  limits on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks  and recordkeeping obligations relating to foreign bank correspondent accounts 
bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on federal reserve act and bank merger applications 
regulation and supervision of the company holding company regulation the company is a registered savings and loan holding company under federal law and is now subject to regulation  supervision  and enforcement actions by the frb as a result of a change in regulations under the dodd frank act 
among other things  this authority permits the frb to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to the bank and to monitor and regulate the company s capital and activities such as dividends and share repurchases that can affect capital 
under long standing frb policy  holding companies are expected to serve as a source of strength for their depository subsidiaries  and may be called upon to commit financial resources and support to those subsidiaries 
under the dodd frank act  the frb is also required to impose capital requirements on savings and loan holding company effective in  as discussed above 
the company is also required to file periodic reports and other information with the frb 
the company may engage in activities permissible for a savings and loan holding company  a bank holding company  or a financial holding company  which generally encompass a wider range of activities that are financial in nature 
the company may not engage in any activities beyond that scope without the approval of the frb 
federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from acquiring control of another savings institution or holding company without prior written regulatory approval 
with some exceptions  it also prohibits the acquisition or retention of more than of the equity securities of a company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature or acquiring an institution that is not federally insured 
in evaluating applications to acquire savings institutions  the regulator must consider the financial and managerial resources  future prospects of the institution involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance fund  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors 
the requirement that the company act as a source of strength for the bank  and the future capital requirements at the company level  may affect the company s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions 
for a discussion of the company s mou with the frb  which provides requirements relating to dividends and share repurchases specific to the company  please refer to regulation and supervision memoranda of understanding above 
federal securities laws the company s common stock is registered with the sec under the securities exchange act of the company is therefore subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the securities exchange act 
as a publicly traded company  the company is also subject to legislation intended to strengthen the securities markets and public confidence in them  for example  the dodd frank act includes requirements for enhanced disclosure and governance requirements for all public companies 
because some frb accounting and governance regulations also refer to the sec s regulations  the sec rules may also affect the bank 
acquisition of bank mutual corporation no person may acquire control of the company or the bank without first obtaining the approval of such acquisition by the appropriate federal regulator 
currently  under the federal change in bank control act and the savings and loan holding company act  any person  including a company  or group acting in concert  seeking to acquire or more of the outstanding shares of the company must  depending on the circumstances  obtain the approval of  and or file a notice with the frb 
in addition  any person or group acting in concert seeking to acquire more than of the company s common stock must obtain the prior approval of the frb 
federal and state taxation federal taxation the company and its subsidiaries file a calendar year consolidated federal income tax return  reporting income and expenses using the accrual method of accounting 
the federal income tax returns for the company s subsidiaries have been examined and audited or closed without audit by the internal revenue service for tax years prior to state taxation prior to  the state of wisconsin imposed a corporate franchise tax of on the separate taxable incomes of the members of the company s consolidated income tax group  excluding its nevada subsidiaries 
under that law  the income of the nevada subsidiaries was only subject to taxation in nevada  which currently does not impose a corporate income or franchise tax 
however  beginning in  wisconsin law was amended to significantly restrict the tax benefits of out of state investment subsidiaries through the enactment of combined reporting legislation 
as a result  the company s consolidated income tax group is subject to combined reporting  which resulted in wisconsin income taxes being imposed on the earnings of the bank s out of state investment subsidiaries since for additional discussion regarding the impact of this change  refer to results of operations income tax expense benefit in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
also  refer to item a 
risk factors  for additional discussion 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the discussion and analysis set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the cautionary statements set forth in item business  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating the company s results of operations  financial condition  and outlook 
these risk factors should also be considered when evaluating any investment decision with respect to the company s common stock 
the global credit market instability and weak economic conditions may significantly affect the company s liquidity  financial condition  and results of operations global financial markets continue to be unstable and unpredictable  and economic conditions have been weak 
developments relating to the federal budget  federal borrowing authority  or other political issues could also negatively impact these markets  as could global developments such as the european sovereign debt crisis 
continued  and potentially increased  volatility  instability and weakness could affect the company s ability to sell investment securities and other financial assets  which in turn could adversely affect the company s liquidity and financial position 
this instability also could affect the prices at which the company could make any such sales  which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
conditions could also negatively affect the company s ability to secure funds or raise capital for acquisitions and other projects  which in turn  could cause the company to use deposits or other funding sources for such projects 
in addition  the instability of the markets and weakness of the economy could affect the strength of the company s customers or counterparties  their willingness to do business with  and or their ability or willingness to fulfill their obligations to the company  which could further affect the company s results of operations 
current conditions  including high unemployment  weak corporate performance  soft real estate markets  and the decline of home sales and property values  could negatively affect the volume of loan originations and prepayments  the value of the real estate securing the company s mortgage loans  and borrowers ability or willingness to repay loan obligations  all of which could adversely impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s actual loan losses may exceed its allowance for loan losses  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations the company has policies and procedures in place to manage its exposure to risk related to its lending operations 
however  despite these practices  the company s loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance 
continued economic weakness  including high unemployment rates and declining values of the collateral underlying loans  may affect borrowers ability or willingness to repay their loan obligations that could lead to increased loan losses or provisions 
as a result  the company may experience significant loan losses  including losses that may exceed the amounts established in the allowance for loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results and capital 
further declines in real estate values may continue to adversely affect collateral values and the company s results of operations the company s market areas have generally experienced a decline in real estate values  elevated levels of residential and non residential tenant vacancies  and weakness in the market for sale of new or existing properties  for both commercial and residential real estate 
these developments could continue to negatively affect the value of the collateral securing the company s mortgage and related loans 
that decrease in value could in turn lead to increased losses on loans in the event of foreclosures 
increased losses would affect the company s loan loss allowance and may cause it to increase its provision for loan losses resulting in a charge to earnings and capital 
some of the company s lending activities are riskier than one to four family real estate loans the company has identified commercial real estate  commercial business  construction  and consumer loans as areas for lending emphasis and has augmented its personnel in recent periods to increase its penetration in the commercial lending market 
while the company is pursuing this lending diversification for the purpose of increasing net interest income  these types of loans historically have carried greater risk of payment default than residential real estate loans 
as the volume of these types of loans increases  credit risk increases 
in the event of continued substantial borrower defaults and or increased defaults resulting from these diverse types of lending  the company s provision for loan losses would further increase and loans may be written off  and therefore  earnings would be reduced 
further  as the portion of the company s loans secured by the assets of commercial enterprises increases  the company becomes increasingly exposed to environmental liabilities and compliance burdens 
even though the company is subject to environmental requirements in connection with residential real estate lending  the possibility of liability increases in connection with commercial lending  particularly in industries that use hazardous materials and or generate waste or pollution or that own property that was the subject of prior contamination 
if the company does not adequately assess potential environment risks  the value of the collateral it holds may be less than it expects  and it may be exposed to liability for remediation or other environmental compliance 
regulators are becoming increasingly stringent  which may affect the company s business and results of operations in addition to new laws and increasing amounts of regulation  the regulatory climate in the us  particularly for financial institutions  has become increasingly strict and stringent 
as a consequence  regulatory activity affecting specific institutions has also increased in recent periods 
for example  as previously noted both the company and the bank are subject to mous with their primary regulators 
the mous have imposed specific requirements  and could affect the company s and the bank s operations and ability to pursue opportunities  as well as their financial needs  results and ability to pay dividends 
further  because the responsibility for regulating savings associations and their holding companies has transitioned to different regulatory agencies  the frb and the occ  these agencies may approach that regulation in different or stricter ways than the predecessor agency  which also could affect the company s and the bank s costs of compliance and results of operations 
the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company is subject to current and potential future limitations that may affect the company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders and repurchase its stock the company is a separate legal entity from the bank and engages in no substantial activities other than its ownership of the common stock of the bank 
consequently  the company s net income and cash flows are derived primarily from the bank s operations and capital distributions 
the availability of dividends from the bank to the company is limited by various statutes and regulations  including those of the occ and frb  as a result  it is possible  depending on the results of operations and the financial condition of the bank and other factors  that the occ and or the frb could restrict the payment by the bank of dividends or other capital distributions or take other actions which could negatively affect the bank s results and dividend capacity 
the federal regulators have become increasingly stringent in their interpretation  application and enforcement of banks capital requirements  which along with the mou also could affect the regulators willingness to allow bank dividends to the company 
if the bank is required to reduce its dividends to the company  or is unable to pay dividends at all  or the frb separately does not allow the company to pay dividends under the mou  the company may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders at existing levels or at all and or may not be able to repurchase its common stock 
future events may result in a valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax asset may which may have a significant effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition as of december   the company s net deferred tax asset was million 
management evaluates this asset on an on going basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
management determined that no valuation allowance was required to be recorded against the company s net deferred tax asset as of december  this determination required significant management judgment based on positive and negative considerations 
such considerations included the company s cumulative three year net loss  the nature of the components of such cumulative loss  recent trends in earnings excluding one time charges such as the fhlb prepayment penalty in and the goodwill impairment in  expectations for the company s future earnings  the duration of federal and state net operating loss carryforward periods  and other factors 
future events or circumstances could result in conditions that differ significantly from management s current assessment of these positive and negative considerations  particularly as such relate to the company s future earnings 
changes in these considerations could result in a significant valuation allowance being recorded against the company s net deferred tax asset  which could have a significant effect on the company s future results of operations and financial condition 
recent and future legislation and rulemaking in response to market and economic conditions may significantly affect the company s results of operations and financial condition instability  volatility  and failures in the credit and financial institutions markets have led regulators and legislators to consider and or adopt proposals that will significantly affect financial institutions and their holding companies  including the company 
legislation such as the emergency economic stabilization act of  the american recovery and reinvestment act of  and the dodd frank act of  as well as programs such as the troubled assets relief program  were adopted 
although designed to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate impact of these actions on financial markets 
the failure of these actions could have a material  adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the value of the company s securities 
further legislative and regulatory proposals to reform the us financial system would also affect the company and the bank 
for example  under pending proposals  the roles of fannie mae and or freddie mac could be substantially altered or eliminated  which could have a significant effect on the housing market in the united states  including as a result of potentially decreased liquidity for mortgages on the secondary market  and lending practices related to real estate mortgages 
the dodd frank act created the cfpb  which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority with respect to entities  including financial institutions  that offer to consumers covered financial products and services 
the cfpb is required to adopt rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair  deceptive or abusive relating to any customer transaction for a consumer financial product or service  or the offering of a consumer financial product or service 
the full scope of the impact of this authority has not yet been determined as related rules have not all yet been adopted 
the company cannot yet determine the costs and limitations related to these additional regulatory requirements  however  the costs of compliance and the effect on its business may have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and results 
also  weak economic conditions have resulted in periodic attempts by federal  state  and or local governments to legislate foreclosure forbearance  forced loan modifications  cram downs of losses to lenders in bankruptcy proceedings  or upkeep laws for foreclosed properties  or take other action that could increase the time or costs of foreclosure or the costs of holding foreclosed real estate 
such actions and efforts  if successful  could lead to increased loan charge offs or loan loss provisions and or reduced income 
these efforts could also adversely affect the value of certain mortgage related securities not guaranteed by freddie mac  fannie mae  and ginnie mae  such as private label cmos 
recently enacted laws  proposed acts  taxes and fees  or any other legislation or regulations ultimately enacted  could materially affect the company  the bank and their operations and profitability by imposing additional regulatory burdens and costs  imposing limits on fees and other sources of income  and otherwise more generally affecting the conduct of their business 
the interest rate environment may have an adverse impact on the company s net interest income a volatile interest rate environment makes it difficult for the company to coordinate the timing and amount of changes in the rates of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings with the rates of interest it earns on loans and securities 
in addition  volatile interest rate environments cause corresponding volatility in the demand by individuals and businesses for the loan and deposit products offered by the company 
this volatility has a direct impact on the company s net interest income  and consequently  its net income 
future interest rates could continue to be volatile and management is unable to predict the impact such volatility would have on the net interest income and profits of the company 
changes in market interest rates or other conditions may have an adverse impact on the fair value of the company s available for sale securities  shareholders equity  and profits gaap requires the company to carry its securities at fair value on its balance sheet 
unrealized gains or losses on these securities  reflecting the difference between the fair market value and the amortized cost  net of its tax effect  are included as a component of shareholders equity 
when market rates of interest increase  the fair value of the company s securities available for sale generally decreases and equity correspondingly decreases 
when rates decrease  fair value generally increases and shareholders equity correspondingly increases 
however  due to significant disruptions in global financial markets  such as those which occurred in  this usual relationship can be disrupted 
despite a generally declining interest rate environment since that time  certain of the company s available for sale securities specifically  its private label cmos continue to have fair values that are substantially less than amortized cost 
management expects continued volatility in the fair value of its private label cmos and is not able to predict when or if the fair value of such securities will fully recover 
wisconsin tax developments could reduce the company s net income like many wisconsin financial institutions  the company has non wisconsin subsidiaries that hold and manage investment assets and loans  the income from which had not previously been subject to wisconsin tax prior to the wisconsin department of revenue the department has instituted an audit program specifically aimed at financial institutions out of state investment subsidiaries 
the department has asserted the position that some or all of the income of the out of state subsidiaries in years prior to was taxable in wisconsin 
in the department s auditor issued a notice of proposed audit report to the bank which proposes to tax all of the income of the bank s out of state investment subsidiaries for all periods that are still open under the statute of limitations  which includes tax years back to this is a preliminary determination made by the auditor and does not represent a formal assessment 
the bank s outside legal counsel has met with representatives of the department to discuss  and object to  the auditor s proposed adjustments 
the department has requested further information to support the company s position  which the company is in the process of providing 
management continues to believe that the bank has reported income and paid wisconsin taxes in prior periods in accordance with applicable legal requirements and the department s long standing interpretations of them and that the bank s position will prevail in discussions with the department  court proceedings  or other actions that may occur 
ultimately  however  an adverse resolution of these matters could result in additional wisconsin tax obligations for prior periods  which could have a substantial negative impact on the bank s earnings in the period such resolution is reached 
the bank may also incur further costs in the future to address and defend these issues 
strong competition within the company s market area may affect net income the company encounters strong competition both in attracting deposits and originating real estate and other loans 
the company competes with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms 
the company s market area includes branches of several commercial banks that are substantially larger than the company in terms of deposits and loans 
in addition  tax exempt credit unions operate in most of the company s market area and aggressively price their products and services to a large part of the population 
if competitors succeed in attracting business from the company s customers  its deposits and loans could be reduced  which would likely affect earnings 
the company is subject to security risks and failures and operational risks relating to the use of technology that could damage its reputation and business security breaches in the company s internet  telephonic  or other electronic banking activities could expose it to possible liability and damage its reputation 
any compromise of the company s security also could deter customers from using its internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information 
the company relies on standard internet and other security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data 
these precautions may not protect the company s systems from compromises or breaches of its security measures  which could result in damage to the company s reputation and business and affect its results of operations 
additionally  as a financial institution  the company s business is data intensive 
beyond the inherent nature of a financial institution that requires it to process and track extremely large numbers of financial transactions and accounts  the company is required to collect and maintain significant data about its customers 
these operations require the company to obtain and maintain technology and security related systems that are mission critical to its business 
the company s failure to do so could significantly affect its ability to conduct business and its customers confidence in it 
further  the company outsources a large portion of its data processing to third parties 
if these third party providers encounter technological or other difficulties or if they have difficulty in communicating with the company  it will significantly affect the company s ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions  which would significantly affect business operations 
further  the technology affecting the financial institutions industry and consumer financial transactions is rapidly changing  with the frequent introduction of new products  services  and alternatives
