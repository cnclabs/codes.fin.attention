item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
you should read this discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those described in risk factors under item a and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading global provider of software as a service  or saas  clinical technology solutions that enhance the efficiency of our customers clinical development processes from concept to conclusion  optimizing their research and development investments 
our customers are pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies  academic institutions  contract research organizations  or cros  and other organizations engaged in clinical trials to bring medical products and treatments to market and explore new indications for existing medical products 
our solutions allow our customers to increase the value of their development programs by more efficiently and effectively designing  planning  and managing key aspects of the clinical trial process  including study and protocol design  trial planning and budgeting  site negotiation  clinical portal  trial management  randomization and trial supply management  clinical data capture and management  safety events capture  medical coding  clinical business analytics  and data flow and interoperability among multiple trial applications 
our customers rely on our solutions to safely accelerate the clinical development process  driving decision making and saving resources in the development lifecycle 
the demand for electronic clinical solutions  such as those provided by us  has been driven by the increasing complexity and cost associated with paper based trials and inefficiencies with early generation electronic data capture  or edc  solutions 
paper based trials may delay the clinical development process  impair data quality and prevent real time decision making  while traditional edc solutions have faced challenges with integration  site requirements  customization and scalability 
we have grown our revenues significantly since inception by expanding our customer base  increasing penetration with existing customers  enhancing our products and services and growing our indirect channel 
in 
table of contents order to achieve and sustain our growth objectives  we have and will continue to invest in key areas  including new personnel  particularly in direct domestic and international sales activities  resources to support our product development  including product functionality and platform  marketing programs to build brand awareness  and infrastructure to support growth 
we derive a majority of our application services revenues through multi study arrangements for a pre determined number of studies 
we also offer our application services on a single study basis that allows customers to use our solution for a limited number of studies or to evaluate it prior to committing to multi study arrangements 
we invest heavily in training our customers  their investigators and other third parties to configure clinical trials independently 
we believe this knowledge transfer accelerates customer adoption of our solutions 
we use a number of metrics to evaluate and manage our business 
these metrics include revenue growth  customer growth  customer retention rate  revenues from lost customers  geographic contribution  and application services backlog 
our customer base has grown from at january  to at december  our relationships with some of these customers include multiple divisions and business units at various domestic and international locations 
we generate revenues from sales to new customers as well as sales and renewals from our existing customers 
our global direct sales organization represents our primary source of sales  with an increasing number of sales generated through our cro relationships 
our customer retention rate was  and in  and  respectively 
we calculate customer retention based upon the number of customers that existed both at the beginning and end of the relevant period 
revenues from lost customers accounted for  and of total prior year revenues in  and  respectively 
to calculate the impact of customers lost during the period  we consider the revenues recognized from lost customers during the most recent prior fiscal year as a percentage of total company revenues from the same period 
traditionally  we maintain a high percentage of customer retention and hence the revenue impact from lost customers is insignificant to our total revenues 
our revenues from lost customers in was impacted by a contract termination which resulted in a one time acceleration of revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of we believe revenues from lost customers coupled with customer retention rate give the best sense of volume and scale of customer loss and retention 
our presentation of customer retention and revenues from lost customers may differ from other companies in our industry 
we manage our business as one reportable segment 
historically  we have generated most of our revenues from sales to customers located in the united states 
however  revenues generated from customers located in europe and asia including australia represent a significant portion of overall revenues 
revenues generated from customers located in europe represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues generated from customers in asia represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect sales from customers in europe and asia to continue to represent a significant portion of total sales as we continue to serve existing and new customers in these markets 
with our adoption of accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  on january   as disclosed in our critical accounting policies  we recognize revenue from professional services as services are delivered for all arrangements entered into or modified subsequent to  while revenue recognition for professional services arrangements entered into prior to continues to be ratable over the term of the corresponding applications services arrangement until such arrangements expire 
thus  over time we expect professional services to no longer contribute to total backlog or deferred revenue in a significant manner 
consequently  we now monitor application services backlog as an indicator of the underlying health of our business 
application services backlog solely relates to our saas offerings  representing the total future contract value of outstanding  multi study and single study arrangements  billed and unbilled  at a point in time 
application services revenue generated in any given period is a function of revenue recognized from the beginning of period 
table of contents application services backlog  contract renewals  and new customer contracts 
for this reason  application services backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of long term future performance 
we monitor the amount of revenues expected to be recognized from application services backlog over the current fiscal year while updating application services backlog each quarter to indicate how much remains to be recognized within the year 
as of january  and  we had full year application services backlog of approximately million and million  respectively 
our presentation of backlog may differ from other companies in our industry 
given that our professional services will no longer contribute to total backlog or deferred revenue in a significant manner as a result of our adoption of asu no 
 over time  we expect professional revenues to better reflect professional services billings activity 
we consider the global adoption of clinical development technologies to be essential to our future growth 
our future growth will also depend on our ability to sustain the high levels of customer satisfaction and our ability to increase sales to existing customers 
in addition  the market for our products is often characterized by rapid technological change and evolving regulatory standards 
our future growth is dependent on the successful development and introduction of new products and enhancements 
to address these challenges  we will continue to expand our direct and indirect sales channels in domestic and international markets  pursue research and development as well as acquisition opportunities to expand and enhance our product offerings  expand our marketing efforts  and drive customer adoption through our knowledge transfer professional services offerings 
our success in these areas will depend upon our abilities to execute on our operational plans  interpret and respond to customer and regulatory requirements  and retain key staff 
acquisition of clinical force on july   we completed an acquisition of clinical force  a provider of saas clinical trial management systems  or ctms 
with this acquisition  we expanded our service offerings to include a clinical trial management solution  which enables our customers to reduce the financial and operational management burden of clinical trials  streamline clinical processes  and increase visibility to timely information that enhances governance and decision making  the total consideration is expected to be million  consisting of a cash payment of million paid at the closing date  plus additional performance based earn out payments of up to million which had an estimated fair value of million as of the acquisition date 
our results of operations for include the operations of clinical force since the date of acquisition 
we have combined clinical force into our single operating segment 
litigation settlement on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with datasci 
the settlement agreement relates to a lawsuit filed by datasci in alleging breach of contract for failing to pay royalties under a prior license and settlement agreement executed between the parties in june under the recent settlement agreement  we agreed to make a one time  lump sum payment to datasci in the amount of million to settle the claim and obtain an irrevocable  fully paid  worldwide  non exclusive license to the patent that was the subject of the claim by datasci 
the related payment was made on december   and the full amount of the settlement is included in our results of operations for the year ended december  sources of revenues we derive revenues from application services and professional services 
application services consist of multi study or single study arrangements  which give our customers the right to use our software solutions  hosting and site support  as well as clinical trial planning software solutions  which enable our customers to effectively manage their trial planning 
professional services consist of assisting our customers and partners with the design  workflow  implementation and management of their clinical trials 

table of contents our application services are principally provided through multi study arrangements  which grant customers the right to manage up to a predetermined number of clinical trials for a term generally ranging from three to five years  as well as single study arrangements that allow customers to use application services for an individual study and or to evaluate our application services prior to committing to multi study arrangements 
many of our customers have migrated from single study arrangements to multi study arrangements and multi study arrangements represent the majority of our application services revenues 
we also offer other applications that improve efficiencies for clinical trials from concept to conclusion 
our professional services provide our customers with reliable  repeatable and cost effective implementation and training in the use of our application services 
we also offer consulting services to advise customers on ways to optimize their clinical development process from trial concept to conclusion 
professional services revenues have represented a smaller portion of overall revenues in recent years 
in  our professional services revenues were positively impacted by certain one time revenue acceleration as required per the adoption of asu no 
on january  over the long term  we expect professional services revenues to decline as a percentage of total revenues as our customers and partners become more adept at the management and configuration of our technology for their clinical trials as part of our knowledge transfer efforts 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to hosting  maintaining and supporting our application suite and delivering our professional services and support 
these costs include salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation for our data center and professional services staff 
cost of revenues also includes costs associated with our data center  including networking and related depreciation expense  as well as outside service provider costs  amortization expense and general overhead 
we allocate general overhead  such as applicable shared rent and utilities  to cost of revenues based on relative headcount 
the costs associated with providing professional services are recognized as such costs are incurred 
over the long term  we believe that cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues will decrease 
operating costs and expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our research and development staff  including salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation  the cost of certain third party service providers and allocated overhead 
we have focused our research and development efforts on expanding the functionality and ease of use of our applications 
we expect research and development costs to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we intend to release new features and functionality designed to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the clinical development process for our customers 
over the long term  we believe that research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decline slightly 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff  including salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation  commissions  travel costs  and marketing and promotional events  corporate communications  advertising  other brand building and product marketing expenses and allocated overhead 
our sales and marketing expenses have increased in absolute dollars primarily due to our ongoing substantial investments in customer acquisition 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars 
over the long term  we believe that sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decline slightly 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for executive  legal  regulatory  finance and human resource departments  including salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation  professional fees  insurance premiums  allocated overhead and other corporate expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add administrative personnel and incur additional professional fees and other 
table of contents expenses resulting from continued growth and the compliance requirements of operating as a public company 
over the long term  we believe that general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decrease 
income tax expense prior to  we did not realize an income tax benefit for the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets as we had yet to determine that it was more likely than not that our future taxable income would be sufficient to utilize these tax benefits 
as a result  we had provided a valuation allowance against the majority of our net deferred tax assets as of and prior to december  in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  including the net operating loss carryforwards  we assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize our existing deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that  as a result of our evaluation of deferred tax asset recoverability against our estimated future taxable income  it was more likely than not that we will realize the benefit from the majority of our deferred tax assets 
consequently  we recorded a one time benefit of approximately million resulting from the reversal of the valuation allowance on the majority of our net deferred tax assets 
we have us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which do not fully expire until and are subject to limitations under section of the internal revenue code  or section with the reversal of the valuation allowance that occurred in  we expect that our effective income tax rate will range from to percent in see note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for more information regarding our income taxes 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  require the application of significant judgment in the preparation of our financial statements  and as a result they are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in calculating estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we derive our revenues from the sale of application services and the rendering of professional services 
we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  service has been delivered to the customer  amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fees is reasonably assured or probable 
application services we typically enter into multi study and single study arrangements that include the sale of software licenses that provide our customers the right to use our software  as well as hosting and other support services  to be provided over a specified term 
we recognize revenues ratably over the term of the arrangement  beginning with 
table of contents the commencement of the arrangement term  which correlates with the activation of the hosting services  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the term of the arrangement includes optional renewal periods if such renewal periods are likely to be exercised 
professional services we also provide a range of professional services that our customers have the ability to utilize on an as needed basis 
these services generally include training  implementation  interface creation  trial configuration  data testing  reporting  procedure documentation and other customer specific services 
professional services do not result in significant alterations to our underlying software 
in certain situations  when professional services are sold separate and apart from application services  they are recognized as services are rendered or using a proportional performance method based on services performed for fixed free professional services 
multiple element arrangements we may also enter into arrangements to provide a combination of our offerings of application services and professional services 
our professional services are typically sold together with application services as a component of a single study or multi study arrangement 
on january   we adopted accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amends current guidance on arrangements with multiple deliverables under accounting standards codification  or asc   revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
as a result  the revenues for the majority of our multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified in are recognized in accordance with the provisions under asu 
no to qualify as a separate unit of accounting under asu no 
 the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
the significant deliverables under our multiple element arrangements are application services and professional services 
we determined that the application services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately without professional services 
since we provide saas application services  the service components  including license  hosting  and support  are combined and accounted for as a separate unit of accounting 
we use estimated selling price  or esp  to determine the selling pricing for application services when sold in multiple element arrangements  as we do not have vendor specific evidence  or vsoe  for these application services and third party evidence  or tpe  is not a practical alternative due to differences in features and functionality as compared with other companies offerings 
we also determined that professional services have standalone value because those services are sold separately by other vendors 
we use esp to determine the selling price for professional services when sold in multiple element arrangements  as we do not have sufficient reliable pricing data to establish vsoe and tpe is not a practical alternative due to the incompatibility of our services with other vendors 
we determine our single point esp for application services and professional services as follows application services we have developed an internal pricing tool that provides price quotes for application services configurations 
any new potential customer application services arrangements must be priced through the utilization of our internal pricing tool 
we have established an internal committee to monitor compliance and evaluate pricing data on a periodic basis 
this evaluation includes the review of historical pricing data  market conditions consideration and the review of pricing strategies and practices 
any necessary pricing modification made to the internal pricing tool is supported by the result of such evaluation 
accordingly  our esp for application services is obtained from the internal pricing tool 

table of contents professional services we evaluate internal historical professional services pricing data to determine average pricing rates by type of professional services rendered 
these averages are utilized to determine esp for professional services  and are reviewed and updated at least annually 
we believe the effect of changes in either the selling price  or the method  of assumptions used to determine esp for application services and professional services will not have significant effect on the allocation of the arrangement consideration as the esp for the above deliverables are based on historical pricing data 
for multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified in  we allocate the arrangement consideration based on their related esp 
revenues for deliverables under application services are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  beginning with the commencement of the arrangement term  which correlates with the activation of the hosting services  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the majority of our professional services under multiple element arrangements are fixed fee 
therefore  revenues for deliverables under professional services are recognized using a proportional performance method as services are rendered 
for multiple element arrangements entered into prior to  we account for these arrangements as a combined single unit of accounting  which includes application services and professional services  and the related revenues are recognized ratably beginning with the commencement of the arrangement term  assuming all other remaining revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenues for any deliverables included in multiple element arrangements that are within the scope of asc  software revenue recognition  will continue to be recognized under such accounting standards 
in addition  for multiple element arrangements entered into prior to  management s estimate of fair value for professional services is used to derive a reasonable approximation for presenting application services and professional services separately in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred revenue deferred revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
we invoice our customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract  usually in installments in advance of the related service period 
accordingly  the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of outstanding arrangements 
payment terms are net to days 
deferred revenue that will be recognized during the subsequent month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion as non current deferred revenue 
in some instances  customers elect to renew their application services arrangements prior to the original termination date of the arrangement 
the renewed application services agreement provides support for in process clinical trials  and includes the right to use the software for initial clinical studies 
as such  the unrecognized portion of the deferred revenue associated with the initial arrangement is aggregated with the consideration received upon renewal and recognized as revenues over the renewed term of the application services arrangements 
in connection with our adoption of asu no 
on january   the recognizable portion of any remaining deferred revenue associated with multiple element arrangements that are materially modified in is calculated based on an allocation of the total arrangement consideration which includes the consideration of the modified arrangement plus the remaining balance of the deferred revenue  to the remaining deliverables on the basis of their relative selling price 
if the total arrangement consideration exceeds the sum of the total selling prices for the remaining deliverables  the surplus is recognized as revenue in the period of modification 
if the total arrangement consideration does not exceed the sum of the total selling prices for the remaining deliverables  the shortfall is considered a discount and allocated to the remaining deliverables utilizing a relative selling price method 

table of contents stock based compensation we currently follow asc  compensation stock compensation  to account for all of our stock based compensation plans 
according to asc  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options  nonvested restricted stock awards and employee stock purchase plans  are treated the same as any other form of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations 
under asc  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the expense is recognized ratably over the award s vesting period 
for all grants  we recognize compensation cost under the straight line method 
we measure the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model which requires the use of several estimates  including the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected life of the option  risk free interest rates  and expected dividend yield 
the use of different assumptions in the black scholes pricing model would result in different amounts of stock based compensation expense 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
prior to the completion of our ipo in june  we were not a publicly traded company and had limited historical information on the price of our stock as well as employees stock option exercise behavior 
as a result  we could not rely on historical experience alone to develop assumptions for the expected stock price volatility and the expected life of options 
as such  our expected stock price volatility was estimated with reference to a peer group of companies and our expected life of options was estimated based on the likely date of exercise in accordance with our internal studies of historical experience and projected exercise behavior as opposed to the actual life of the options 
subsequent to the completion of our ipo  we continue to use stock price volatility of our peer group of companies as a basis for determining the expected volatility together with the closing prices of our publicly traded stock 
we will increase the weight of our own stock price volatility within the weighted average over time as sufficient historical experience of our stock price is established 
in addition  as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data in the period since our stock began being publicly traded to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life  we use the simplified method as allowed under sec staff accounting bulletin no 
for estimating the expected life of options as all of our options qualify as plain vanilla options 
the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury yield curve with a maturity tied to the expected life of the option 
we have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock 
the fair value of each nonvested restricted stock award grant is measured as if the nonvested restricted stock was vested and issued on the grant date 
we recorded stock based compensation of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in future periods  stock based compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of our existing unrecognized stock based compensation and as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain employees and non employee directors 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation costs related to all non vested equity awards granted under our stock option plan and plan 
the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over an average period of years for stock options and years for nonvested restricted stock awards as of december  
table of contents goodwill and intangibles goodwill  which consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired  is evaluated for impairment using a two step process that is performed at least annually on october of each year  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
the first step is a comparison of the fair value of an internal reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill to a determination of the implied value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater that the implied value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
the implied value of goodwill is determined as of the test date by performing a purchase price allocation  as if the reporting unit had just been acquired  using currently estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  together with an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole 
the estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is based upon information available regarding our market capitalization  prices of similar groups of assets  or other valuation techniques including present value techniques based upon estimates of future cash flow 
intangible assets  including technology  database  customer relationships  and customer contracts arising from our two acquisitions since  are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized using a method which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefit of the related intangible asset is utilized 
we had intangible assets of million and million  respectively as of december  and for intangible assets subject to amortization  impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset 
as of december  and  we had goodwill of million and million  respectively 
the results of our annual impairment test performed on october  indicated that our goodwill was not impaired 
in  as part of our annual goodwill impairment test  we reassessed our reporting units 
based on the results of that assessment  in which we concluded that we are a single reporting unit and operating segment  we considered our market capitalization under the market approach in determining the estimate of fair value of our reporting unit  as management believed that our market capitalization based on quoted market prices was the best evidence in determining such estimated fair value 
the determination of whether or not goodwill or acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting unit 
we set criteria of assumptions and estimates that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  as prescribed by asc  income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in addition  we follow asc for the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
under asc  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 

table of contents we had approximately million and million of federal net operating loss carryforwards as of december  and  respectively  available to offset future taxable income  expiring from through we also had net operating loss carryforwards for state and local income tax purposes in aggregate of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  available to offset future state and local taxable income  expiring from through certain net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitations under section results of operations we recognize revenues from applications services arrangements ratably over the terms of these arrangements 
as a result  a substantial majority of our application services revenues in each quarter are generated from arrangements entered into during prior periods 
consequently  an increase or a decrease in new application services arrangements in any one quarter may not significantly affect our results of operations in that quarter 
additionally  prior to  when we sold application services and professional services in a multiple element arrangement  which is our typical practice  we recognized revenues from professional services ratably over the term of the arrangement  rather than as the professional services were delivered  which varied throughout the arrangement term 
accordingly  a significant portion of the revenues for professional services performed in any reporting period had been deferred to future periods 
in connection with our adoption of asu no 
on january   as noted in our critical accounting policies  we recognize revenues from professional services as delivered for any multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified in regardless of our revenue recognition  we recognize expenses related to our professional services in the period in which the expenses are incurred 
as a result  our professional services revenues and gross margin for any past or future reporting period associated with the multiple element arrangements entered into prior to january  may not be reflective of the professional services delivered during that reporting period or the current business trends with respect to our professional services 
our results of operations for the year ended december  include the operations of clinical force since the date of acquisition on july  for the year ended december   we recognized million in revenues and  excluding the impact of one time acquisition related costs  incurred million each of costs of revenues and operating costs and expenses 
the operations of clinical force did not have a significant impact on our results of operations

total revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to an million increase in revenues from application services and a million increase in revenues from professional services 
application services revenues 
revenues from application services increased million  or  to million in from million in our application services revenues in were impacted by a million one time acceleration of revenue recognition resulting from a customer contract termination 
the majority of the increase in application services revenues was derived from increased activity in our existing large customers and midmarket customers  primarily resulting from new studies and renewals 
we also benefited from increased product uptake and cross selling to existing customers  as well as new customer additions 
in  we added customers  including customers acquired as a result of the acquisition of clinical force  to reach a total of customers as of december  revenues from new customers accounted for of the total increase in application services revenues 
our customers continued to contract for more products in addition to our principal offering  medidata rave 
the revenues from these other products grew significantly compared with 
table of contents prior period and accounted for of total application services revenues during as a result of our adoption of asu no 
 our application services revenues also benefited from a million one time revenue acceleration during primarily associated with two customer contract renewals  of which approximately million was accelerated into from professional services revenues 
revenues from professional services increased million  or  to million in from million in professional services revenues benefited from a million one time revenue acceleration associated with two customer contract renewals during as required per the adoption of asu no 
 of which approximately million was accelerated into from excluding this impact  the increase in professional services revenues was primarily driven by the timing of revenue recognition  as our professional service revenues in multiple element arrangements entered into in are recognized on a more accelerated  as delivered basis  following our adoption of asu no

total cost of revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in total cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in cost of application services revenues 
cost of application services revenues 
cost of application services revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs 
we continued to increase staffing levels to support our growth in business 
the increase was partially offset by the decrease in technology related expenses primarily due to our lower capital expenditure in as compared with prior period 
cost of professional services revenues 
cost of professional services decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily driven by lower personnel related costs and allocated general overhead costs resulting from a decline in headcount due to our effort to increase the utilization of professional services staff

total operating costs and expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in costs increased in each department with the largest increase in sales and marketing 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of million  which was attributable to our increase in staffing levels in order to support our strategy to continue to enhance and broaden our product offerings 
the increase was also due to an increase in technology related expenses of million to support our overall growth in research and development 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher personnel related costs of million  attributable to our sales team expansion in order to support our increased sales related activities 
the increase in personnel related costs was also attributable to a higher commission expense driven by our sales growth and a higher stock based compensation expense 
the overall increase was also due to higher conference expenses as a result of increased sales and marketing efforts and higher recruiting costs driven by the headcount growth 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in professional fees of million and personnel related costs of million 
the increased professional fees were driven by higher accounting fees  and certain legal fees incurred for our acquisition of clinical force and associated with our litigation matters 
the increase in personnel related costs primarily resulted from a higher stock based compensation expense resulting from a full year impact from our equity awards granted in may  as well as additional costs associated with our equity awards granted in may the increase was also impacted by a million charge relating to the fair value adjustment of contingent consideration associated with our acquisition of clinical force 
our total operating costs and expenses in also included a million charge in connection with the litigation settlement with datasci in december see note  commitments and contingencies legal matters  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for more information regarding this settlement

application services revenues 
revenues from application services increased million  or  to million in from million in the majority of the increase in application services revenues was derived from increased activity in our existing large customers  primarily resulting from new studies and renewals 
we also benefited from increased product uptake and cross selling to existing customers  as well as new customer additions 
we increased the number of customers to compared with a year ago and continued our success in adding new midmarket customers 
revenues from new customers accounted for of the total increase in application services revenues

revenues from customers based in asia and europe grew and  respectively  whereas revenues from customers based in north america grew 
professional services revenues 
revenues from professional services decreased million  or  to million in from million in our professional services continue to represent a smaller portion of total revenues as our strategy has been to enable our customers to implement studies on their own or through cros  rather than incurring additional follow on costs 
this has contributed to lower professional services revenues compared with the prior year 
an additional factor contributing to the decline was an update to the estimated fair value utilized to determine the value of our professional services revenues

additionally  costs were impacted by a higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the purchase of certain technology equipment at the end of and increased costs associated with certain software licenses and maintenance renewals in the current year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was also driven by a slight increase in professional fees  primarily due to higher legal fees incurred in association with certain of our litigation and indemnification obligation matters  as well as additional professional fees incurred as a result of being a public company since june  partially offset by the reduction of certain non recurring costs associated with our secondary offering in december income taxes income tax expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to our ability to fully utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards to offset federal taxable income as a result of the increased section limitation in our foreign income taxes were fairly consistent in as compared with liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december  and million at december  cash and cash equivalents increased million during primarily due to our strong sales activities and collection of our accounts receivable  partially offset by the litigation settlement payment and cash consideration paid for the acquisition of clinical force 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million in in comparison with was primarily due to the net purchases of marketable securities and the funding of capital expenditures  partially offset by cash generated from our higher net income 
prior to completing the ipo in june  we funded our growth primarily through the private sale of equity securities  borrowings through various debt agreements  working capital and equipment leases 
in june  we completed our ipo  issuing million shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
as a result of the offering  we received net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and offering expenses of million 
we used a portion of our net proceeds to prepay the entire outstanding indebtedness of the term loan in july the remaining proceeds were held in cash and cash equivalents through september  and subsequently  a portion of such proceeds has been invested into high quality marketable securities and was used to pay for the acquisition of clinical force in july as a result of the ipo  all outstanding convertible preferred stock was automatically converted into million shares of common stock 
in addition  we paid out all accumulated accrued dividends of million to preferred stockholders at conversion 
in december  we also completed a secondary offering in which certain selling stockholders sold a total of approximately million shares of our common stock 
we did not receive any proceeds but incurred approximately million of offering expenses in connection with this secondary offering 
such offering expenses were expensed as incurred 
we began to invest in marketable securities in october we manage our cash equivalents and marketable securities as a single investment portfolio that is intended to be available to meet our current cash requirements 
cash equivalents substantially consist of investments in money market funds 
marketable securities  which we classify as available for sale securities  primarily consist of high quality commercial paper  corporate bonds  us government debt obligations and bank certificates of deposit 
marketable securities with remaining effective maturities of twelve months or less from the balance sheet date are classified as short term  otherwise  they are classified as long term on the consolidated balance sheet 
we are currently invested entirely in marketable securities with maturities of less than one year for this investment portfolio 

table of contents prior to the repayment of our term loan  we had a senior secured credit facility  as subsequently amended  that included a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
the term loan was fully drawn at closing in september in july  we used a portion of our net proceeds from the ipo to prepay the entire outstanding indebtedness of the term loan 
the total payoff amount of million included the outstanding principal balance of million  as well as accrued interest and termination fees of million 
except for the million reduction of the available amount primarily due to a standby letter of credit issued in connection with the office lease executed under our credit agreement  the revolving line of credit remains undrawn 
as of december   approximately million of the revolving line of credit was still available for future borrowings 
due to the structure of the credit agreement  any future borrowings under the revolving line of credit will be classified as a current liability 
as of december   the effective interest rate for our senior secured credit facility  as amended  was  if borrowing under the us london interbank offer rate  or libor  option 
we are in compliance with all covenants under our senior secured credit facility  as amended  as of december  see revolving line of credit section below for a summary of the second loan modification to our senior secured credit facility

in  we expect to make approximately to million in capital expenditures  primarily to enhance our infrastructure and increase the capacity in our houston data center  as well as to enhance our computer equipment across various corporate functions 
we expect to acquire our capital equipment through purchases as opposed to capital lease arrangements 
our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors  including any expansion of our business that we may complete 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k 
revolving line of credit in june  we entered into the second loan modification agreement with the lender to amend our existing senior secured credit facility 
pursuant to the terms of the second loan modification agreement  our senior secured credit facility was amended to reduce fees payable by us on our million revolving line of credit under the senior secured credit facility by a eliminating the margin on prime rate borrowings and b decreasing the undrawn revolving credit line fee from of the average undrawn balance to an annual rate of of the average undrawn balance  provide us with an option to borrow under the revolving line of credit at an interest rate based on the libor  plus a margin of  simplify our financial reporting procedures by eliminating monthly financial reporting obligations and amending certain reporting procedures  and replace our prior financial covenants with a simplified adjusted quick ratio covenant of as defined in the second loan modification agreement and provide that in the event that we have less than million of cash or cash equivalents in accounts with the lender in excess of our borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  we would also be required to satisfy a minimum trailing two quarter cash flow covenant  commencing at million for the period ended june  and increasing each quarter by million up to million for the quarter ended march  and thereafter

the change in working capital includes a decline in deferred revenue of million  offset somewhat by a decline in accounts receivable of million 
the fluctuation within accounts receivable and deferred revenue was primarily due to strong customer collections  the timing of revenue recognition associated with professional services and the general decline of large upfront payments from application services customers  which is consistent with our expectation as our saas business model continues to evolve

this trend has been consistent with our expectation as our saas business model continues to evolve 
the decrease in accrued expenses was primarily driven by certain accrued fees associated with our secondary offering and indemnification settlement paid in finally  the increase in prepaid expenses related to the payments of certain multi year software related licenses and services expected to be utilized over the following two to three years

subsequently  the claim was reduced to approximately million as of december  the court rendered its decision in january  which awarded approximately million to the plaintiff 
the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal in september as of december   we had an accrual of approximately million associated with this claim 
this accrual was denominated in euros  the same currency as the claim  thus its balance was subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
in december  we reached an agreement with the plaintiff and agreed to pay approximately million to fully settle this lawsuit and million associated with the related payroll tax obligation 
as a result  we recorded a gain of approximately million in the fourth quarter of the settlement amount was paid in december and the payroll tax obligation was subsequently paid in january on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with datasci 
the settlement agreement relates to a lawsuit filed by datasci in alleging breach of contract for failing to pay royalties under a prior license and settlement agreement executed between the parties in june under the recent settlement 
table of contents agreement  we agreed to make a one time  lump sum payment to datasci in the amount of million to settle the claim and obtain an irrevocable  fully paid  worldwide  non exclusive license to the patent that was the subject of the claim by datasci 
prior to negotiation of the settlement agreement  the probable outcome of this litigation had remained uncertain  as the case was in the early stages and a trial date had not been set 
we had consequently been unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of potential loss  if any  associated with this litigation 
as a result  in accordance with asc  contingencies  we did not record a liability until the date of the settlement  when the amount of loss was determined 
the related payment was made on december   and the full amount of the settlement is included in our results of operations for the year ended december  additional information concerning this lawsuit is provided in note  commitments and contingencies legal matters  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
during  two customers had requested that we indemnify them in connection with patent infringement lawsuits filed by datasci  who also filed a lawsuit against us in june as discussed above 
we agreed to defend and indemnify one of these customers with respect to the allegations  claims  and defenses relating to its use of our software 
as the estimated indemnification obligation concerning this claim was determined to be probable and could be reasonably estimated  we had accrued approximately million which was included in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in march  we reached a final agreement with this customer and paid a settlement amount of million to fully settle this indemnification obligation 
no claims were asserted against the second customer with respect to its use of medidata s products  and this and other customers will be exempted from future claims as a result of the settlement with datasci 
in january  we entered into agreements with certain of our executive officers that provide them with certain benefits upon the termination of their employment following a change of control in our company 
the agreements provide that  upon a qualifying event  such officers will be entitled to a a severance payment equal to the officer s base salary plus target bonus amount b continuation of health benefits for months  c immediate vesting of any remaining unvested equity awards  and d a tax gross up payment under section g of the internal revenue code sufficient to reimburse the officer for of any excise tax payable as a result of any termination payments following a change in control  if applicable

cv in the ca district court for the northern district of ohio 
the complaint asserts infringement of us patent no 
 or the patent  which claims a method and system for unifying data from a variety of sources 
the complaint asserts that we infringe the patent owned without providing any details concerning the alleged infringement  and it seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief 
on october   we filed an application for ex parte reexamination of the patent with the pto 
on december   the pto issued a non final rejection of the validity of all claims of the patent 
on the same date  the district court granted our motion to stay the case pending reexamination of the patent in suit 
we believe that we have valid defenses to the lawsuit and intend to defend it vigorously in the event the stay of the case is lifted 
the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome to us in the event the stay of the case is lifted is unknown and a range of loss  if any  cannot be estimated at this time 
as a result  we have not recorded an accrual associated with this litigation

these standby letters of credit were fully collateralized with our restricted cash and revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facility  as amended 
tax uncertainties asc provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals 
table of contents or litigation processes  on the basis of the technical merits 
asc also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available 
effects of recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
asu no 
amends the scoping guidance for software arrangements under asc  software revenue recognition  to exclude tangible products that contain software elements and nonsoftware elements that function together to interdependently deliver the product s essential functionality 
such tangible products being excluded from asu no 
will instead fall under the scope of asu no 
the fasb also provided several considerations and examples for entities applying this guidance 
asu no 
is effective for new or materially modified arrangements in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we adopted asu no 
prospectively and concurrently with asu no 
on january  and the adoption of asu no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 effect of denominating the exercise price of a share based payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity security trades  which amends asc  compensation stock compensation  to clarify that a share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades must not be considered a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  an entity should not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies for classification in equity 
asu no 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  we adopted asu no 
on january  all of our stock based awards granted to our international employees were classified as equity awards in accordance with its current accounting policy  which is consistent with the accounting treatment contained in asu no 
therefore  the adoption of asu no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
the amendments in this asu generally represent clarification of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  but also include instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed 
this asu is the result of joint efforts by the fasb and international accounting standards board to develop a single  converged fair value framework and guidance with respect to how to measure fair value and what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements 
asu no 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt asu no 
on january   and the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  which removes the presentation options contained in asc  comprehensive income  and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
under the two statement approach  the first statement would include components of net income  which is consistent with the format of statement of operations used today  and the second statement would include components of other comprehensive income 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 deferral of the effective date for amendments to presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu  to defer indefinitely the effective date of the 
table of contents specific requirement to present items that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
all other provisions of asu no 
are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements 
early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt the applicable provisions of asu no 
on january   and the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements other than merely a change in its presentation 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment  which simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment 
asu no 
permits an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
asu no 
is effective for interim and financial periods beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt asu no 
on january   and the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
other than our operating leases for office space and computer equipment  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  our cash equivalents are invested principally in money market funds 
we also had investment in marketable securities  which we classify as available for sale securities  totaling million at december  substantially all of our marketable securities are fixed income securities  which primarily consist of high quality commercial paper  corporate bonds  us government debt obligations  and bank certificates of deposit 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as well as marketable securities are held for working capital purposes 
we manage our cash equivalents and marketable securities as a single investment portfolio that is intended to be available to meet our current cash requirements 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature and high credit ratings of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
we have a floating rate revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facility  as amended  which is currently undrawn 
accordingly  we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates if such revolving line of credit is drawn 
assuming the maximum available amount of our revolving line of credit was drawn as of december   each hundred basis point change in prime rate or libor would result in a change in interest expense by an average of approximately million annually 
exchange rate sensitivity we have two separate exposures to currency fluctuation risk subsidiaries outside the united states which use a foreign currency as their functional currency which are translated into us dollars for consolidation and non us dollar invoiced revenues 
changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency are translated into us dollars and result in cumulative translation adjustments  which are included in 
table of contents accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we have translation exposure to various foreign currencies  including the euro  british pound sterling and japanese yen 
the potential translation loss estimated for resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to million 
we generally invoice our customers in us dollars 
however  we invoice a portion of customers in foreign currencies  a majority of which is denominated in euro  swiss franc and canadian dollars 
as such  the fluctuations in such currencies could impact our operating results 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we might not be able to offset these higher costs fully through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
fair value of financial instruments asc  financial instruments  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
the carrying amounts of our financial instruments  which consist of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
fair values of marketable securities are based on unadjusted quoted market prices or pricing models using current market data that are observable either directly or indirectly 
the fair value of contingent consideration is determined based on the likelihood of contingent earn out payments 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized
