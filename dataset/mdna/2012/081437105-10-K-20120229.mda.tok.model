generally about percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry 
sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store 
our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has historically provided a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment  which accounts for about percent of our net sales 
our remaining net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which  while diversified in end use products  is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets 
market conditions the markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive 
our leading flexible packaging market positions in north and south america reflect our focus on expanding our offering of value added  proprietary products 
we also manufacture products for which our technical know how and economies of scale offer us a competitive advantage 
the primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins  films  paper  ink  adhesives  aluminum  and chemicals 
during the first five months of  the cost of our commodity and specialty resin raw materials increased substantially 
furthermore  the time lag between raw material cost increases and the subsequent adjustment of our selling prices in accordance with formulas included in our customer pricing agreements has had a negative effect on operating profit during compared to weak global economic conditions  sustained high unemployment levels  and higher retail food prices in grocery stores has also led to reduced consumer demand for certain packaged food products during lower unit sales volumes during the second half of reflect the lower unit sales volumes experienced by many of our customers 
facility consolidation during the fourth quarter of  bemis initiated a facility consolidation program to improve efficiencies and reduce fixed costs 
as a part of this program  both administrative and production workforce levels were reduced during the fourth quarter 
bemis has also announced the planned closure of five facilities  two of which were completed by early january most of the production from these five facilities will be transferred to other bemis facilities 
charges associated with the facility consolidation related activities totaled million in the fourth quarter of  including million of employee related costs and million of fixed asset accelerated depreciation and writedowns 
management expects to recognize additional pre tax charges related to these efforts of approximately million over the next months  primarily associated with accelerated depreciation  equipment relocation  and lease termination expenses 
cash payments in are expected to be approximately million

these facilities are included in our flexible packaging business segment and produce flexible packaging principally for the food and beverage industries and augment our product offerings and technological capabilities 
the majority of the financing for this transaction was completed during the third quarter of through the issuance of million of public notes and million common shares issued in a secondary public stock offering 
the remaining cash purchase price was financed in the commercial paper market at the time of closing 
sale of discontinued operations under the terms of an order signed by the us district court for the district of columbia on february   a portion of the alcan packaging food americas business acquired on march  was to be divested  accordingly  we had classified the related operating results as discontinued operations

the divested business recorded net sales of approximately million and included two facilities which manufacture flexible packaging for retail natural cheese and shrink bags for fresh red meat 
results of operations consolidated overview in millions  except per share amounts net sales net income attributable to bemis company  inc diluted earnings per share versus net sales for the year ended december  increased by percent 
we estimate that acquisitions increased net sales by approximately percent during the year 
currency translation increased net sales by percent 
the remaining organic sales growth primarily reflects higher selling prices which were partially offset by lower unit sales volume 
higher selling prices during reflect higher raw material costs 
diluted earnings per share for of included charges of for facility consolidation and other costs and related to our mayor packaging acquisition  partially offset by a gain associated with a non us pension plan curtailment 
this compared to diluted earnings per share for of  which included a charge related to our alcan packaging food americas acquisition and a charge related to the pre closing impact of the july financing of the alcan packaging food americas acquisition 
diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were in operating results for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and lower unit sales volumes during the year 
versus net sales for the year ended december  increased by percent 
acquisitions increased net sales by approximately percent during the year 
the effect of currency translations accounted for a percent increase in net sales 
net of these impacts  the increase in net sales primarily reflects higher prices and improved unit sales volume from both existing and acquired operations 
selling prices were increased during in response to higher raw material costs 
diluted earnings per share for of included a charge for transaction related legal  accounting and other professional fees  a charge associated with alcan packaging food americas purchase accounting adjustments for inventory and order backlog  as well as a charge for acquisition related integration costs including severance costs for workforce reductions and equipment relocation costs 
in addition  the pre closing impact of the july financing of the alcan packaging food americas acquisition reduced diluted earnings by per share 
diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were in for the year ended december   diluted earnings per share of included a per share charge representing the impact of alcan packaging food americas acquisition related professional fees  acquisition financing  an administrative sales tax assessment  and severance charges  partially offset by a per share gain on the sale of an asset 
operating results for the year ended december  improved compared with the year ended december  due to increased unit sales volume  currency translation benefits  and the accretive effect of the alcan packaging food americas acquisition

the remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher selling prices partially offset by the impact of lower unit sales volumes of packaging for applications such as bakery  confectionery  pet food  and health and hygiene products 
operating profit for the total year was million  or percent of net sales  compared to million  or percent of net sales  in the net effect of currency translation increased operating profit in by million 
the lower percentage of operating profit to net sales in reflects the impact of higher raw material costs during the first six months of and lower unit sales volumes during the second half of the year 
in addition  operating profit for included million of facility consolidation and other charges and million of mayor packaging acquisition related charges  which was partially offset by a million gain associated with a non us pension plan curtailment 
total year operating profit included million of alcan packaging food americas acquisition related charges 
versus net sales in our flexible packaging business segment increased percent in acquisitions increased net sales by approximately percent  and currency effects accounted for a sales increase of percent 
the remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher sales across many market categories 
operating profit increased to million  or percent of net sales  in  compared to million  or percent of net sales in the net effect of currency translation increased operating profit in by million compared to the decrease in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in reflects the combined impact of generally lower operating margins from the acquired business and the short term negative impact of higher raw material costs in advance of selling price adjustments 
in addition  operating profit includes million of acquisition related charges 
operating margins in benefited from decreasing raw material costs during the first half of that year 
pressure sensitive materials business segment the pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets prime and variable information labels  which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets  graphic design  used to create signage and decorations  and technical components  which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the medical  automotive  construction and electronics industries 
paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment 
dollars in millions net sales operating profit see note to the consolidated financial statements operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus for the total year  net sales of pressure sensitive materials were million  a percent increase from net sales in currency effects increased net sales by percent 
net sales reflected lower unit sales volumes offset by higher selling prices 
operating profit was million or percent of net sales in  compared to million or percent of net sales in the net effect of currency translation increased operating profit in by million 
lower unit sales volumes reflecting current weak economic conditions were offset by higher selling prices across all product categories 
total year operating profit included a million charge related to facility consolidation and other costs 
versus for the total year  net sales of pressure sensitive materials were million  a percent increase from net sales in currency effects accounted for a net sales decline of percent 
the resulting percent increase in net sales reflects the increase in unit sales volumes in compared to when economic conditions negatively impacted demand for our pressure sensitive materials products 
the net effect of currency translation decreased operating profit by million in higher operating profit in reflects the positive impact of substantially improved unit sales volumes combined with disciplined cost management 
consolidated gross profit dollars in millions gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit in reflects the negative impact of increasing resin prices during the first half of the year coupled with lower sales volume during the second half of gross profit in reflects the negative impact of million of expenses associated with the purchase accounting impact of the fair value write up of inventory and a charge for the fair value of the customer order backlog  
table of contents both related to the alcan packaging food americas acquisition 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in is primarily attributable to generally lower operating margins in the newly acquired alcan packaging food americas business combined with increasing raw material costs 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales selling  general  and administrative expenses increased in both and primarily reflecting the increased costs associated with the august  purchase of mayor packaging  and the march  purchase of alcan packaging food americas 
selling  general  and administrative expenses in included million of expenses primarily related to severance and equipment relocation costs associated with our alcan packaging food americas acquisition 
research and development r d dollars in millions research and development r d r d as a percentage of net sales our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations 
our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment  bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment 
we believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency  effectiveness  and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products 
expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold 
other operating income expense  net dollars in millions other operating income expense  net for the year  other operating income and expense included million of fiscal incentive income compared to million in and million in these fiscal incentives are associated with net sales in south america and are included in flexible packaging segment operating profit

income taxes dollars in millions income taxes effective tax rate the difference between our overall tax rate of percent in and  and percent in and the us statutory rate of percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits and the differences between tax rates in the various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests primarily represent the outstanding preferred shares of dixie toga ltda  our brazilian flexible packaging subsidiary 
during the third quarter of  we completed the purchase of the outstanding shares owned by the noncontrolling interest of dixie toga for approximately million 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources debt to total capitalization net debt to total capitalization which includes total debt net of cash balances divided by total debt net of cash balances plus equity was percent at december   compared to percent at december  total debt increased from  million as of december  to  million as of december   principally due to acquisition financing 
in addition  equity balances decreased in reflecting changes in exchange rates used to translate foreign currency financial statements to the us dollar 
credit rating our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two nationally recognized credit rating agencies 
these credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest 
cash flow net cash provided by operations totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in increases in working capital had a negative impact on cash provided by operations during the years presented 
increasing raw material costs negatively impacted working capital levels during and net cash provided by operations was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our us pension plans of million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately million in net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   including the acquisition of both shield pack and mayor packaging 
this compares to cash used in investing activities in totaling billion  reflecting the acquisition of alcan packaging food americas 
during  we invested million net cash in the acquisition of the south american rigid packaging operations of huhtamaki oyi 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  included common stock dividend payments of million  the purchase of million shares of our common stock for million  and the purchase of the remaining shares of our brazilian subsidiary  dixie toga  ltda 
owned by the noncontrolling interest for million 
this compares to cash used for financing activities during the year ended december  that included common stock dividends of million  the purchase of million shares of our common stock for million  and the purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in reflected the issuance of million of public notes and million of common shares issued in a secondary public stock offering 
the proceeds of these financing activities were used to fund the purchase of the alcan packaging food americas acquisition 
available financing in addition to using cash provided by operations  we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs 
at year end  our commercial paper debt outstanding was million 
based on our current credit rating  we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets 
under the terms of our revolving credit agreement  we have the capacity to borrow up to million 
this facility is principally used as back up for our commercial paper program 
our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of major us and international banks 
covenants imposed by the revolving credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses  minimum net worth calculations  and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization 
the revolving credit agreement includes a million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries 
at december   there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
if this revolving credit facility was no longer available to us and we were not able to issue commercial paper  we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market  which would increase our borrowing costs 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a variable interest rate 
public notes totaling million are scheduled to mature in april and industrial revenue bonds totaling million are scheduled to mature in november these bonds have been classified as long term debt on the december  balance sheet in accordance with our ability and intent to refinance them with commercial paper 
liquidity outlook on july   we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the total amount available from million to million and to extend the term from april  to july  as of december   million of outstanding debt was supported by this credit facility  leaving million of available credit 
as of december  cash and cash equivalents outside of the united states was million 
management expects cash flow from operations and available liquidity described above to be sufficient to support operations going forward 
there can be no assurance  however  that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions 
in addition  increases in raw material costs would increase our short term liquidity needs 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million during  compared to million in  and million in over the next several years  we expect average annual capital expenditures to be less than total annual depreciation and amortization expenses 
we expect to fund capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities 

table of contents dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend by percent during the first quarter of to per share from per share 
this follows increases of percent in and percent in in february  the board of directors approved the th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to per share  a percent increase 
share repurchases during  we purchased million shares of our common stock in the open market  compared to million shares in no shares were repurchased during as of december   we were authorized to purchase an additional million shares of our common stock for the treasury 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations  operating lease obligations  and certain other purchase obligations as of december  obligations under capital leases are insignificant 
contractual payments due by period less than to to more than in millions total year years years years long term debt obligations interest expense operating leases purchase obligations postretirement obligations severance total these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on july  certain amounts have been reflected as being due in less than one year even though they have been classified as long term in our consolidated balance sheet 
these items include million notes  million irb  and commercial paper and have been included in long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with our ability and intent to refinance these items on a long term basis 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long term debt 
a portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates 
the amounts disclosed above assume that future variable interest rates are equal to rates at december  we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials  utilities  capital equipment and various other goods and services 
postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded bemis supplemental retirement plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations 
severance costs relate to our facility consolidation program  which is further described in note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to current authoritative accounting guidance  we have accrued income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
these liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
market risks and foreign currency exposures we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative trading purposes 
our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control  counterparty risk  and ongoing reporting 
these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates 
a portion of the interest expense on our outstanding debt is subject to short term interest rates 
as such  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of variable rate debt outstanding which includes million fixed rate notes that have been effectively converted to variable rate debt through the use of a fixed to variable rate interest rate swap would increase by million 
our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months 
counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
we have not designated these derivative 
table of contents instruments as hedging instruments 
the net settlement amount fair value related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other operating income expense  net  which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability 
amounts recognized in income related to forward exchange contracts were million income and million income in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our business in brazil held us dollar denominated debt which created exposure to changes in currency rates when compared to its functional currency of the brazilian real 
in order to hedge this exposure  we entered into currency swap contracts with maturities that matched the underlying debt  effectively converting a portion of the us denominated debt to the local currency 
we had not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
there were no outstanding currency swap contracts as of december  at december   the company had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating million 
the net settlement amount fair value related to swap contracts was recorded on the balance sheet as either a current or long term asset or liability and as an expense element of other non operating income expense  net  which offset the related transaction gains or losses 
amounts recognized in income related to these currency swaps were million expense and million expense in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company enters into interest rate swap contracts to economically convert a portion of the company s fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into four interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million 
these contracts were designated as hedges of the company s million percent fixed rate debt due in the variable rate for each of the interest rate swaps is based on the six month london interbank offered rate libor  set in arrears  plus a fixed spread 
the variable rates are reset semi annually at each net settlement date 
the net settlement benefit to the company  which is recorded as a reduction in interest expense  was million in at december   the fair value of these interest rate swaps was million  in the company s favor  using discounted cash flow or other appropriate methodologies  and is included in deferred charges and other assets with a corresponding increase in long term debt 
the operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of million and million in and  respectively 
operating profit increased by approximately million and million in and  respectively  as a result of foreign currency translation 
shareholders equity includes adjustments to other comprehensive income for changes in currency translation for consolidated balance sheet accounts 
the impact of currency translation during was a decrease in shareholders equity totaling million 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to retirement benefits  intangible assets  goodwill  and expected future performance of operations 
our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities  and the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill 
pension costs amounts related to our defined benefit pension plans that are recognized in our financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
the accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet 
a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states 
net periodic pension cost recorded in was million  compared to pension cost of million in and million in one element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets 
for the year  we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of percent of total assets and an expected long term rate of return on total us pension plan assets of percent 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based on our target asset allocation 
for the historical long term investment periods of   and years ending december   our us pension plan assets earned annualized rates of return of percent  percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
using our us target asset allocation of plan assets of percent equity securities and percent fixed income securities  our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and  based on their results  we have determined our us asset return assumptions to be reasonable 
this assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years 
this process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods 
the net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income and expense 

table of contents at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities 
this discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to changes in rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   for our us defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of one percent from the percent rate used at december  for our non us pension plans  we follow similar methodologies in determining the appropriate expected rates of return on assets and discount rates to be used in our actuarial calculations in each individual country 
us pension assumptions sensitivity analysis based on our current discount rate assumption of percent and our expected rate of return on pension plan assets of percent  we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for to be in a range of million to million 
the following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets 
total increase decrease to pension expense dollars in millions from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent percent rate of return on plan assets percent percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent percent the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset  in the case of an overfunded plan  or as a liability  in the case of an underfunded plan 
the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
the following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate 
total increase decrease in accumulated other comprehensive dollars in millions income  net of taxes  from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent percent intangible assets and goodwill the purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and goodwill 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangible assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was billion as of december  intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  customer relationships  patents  trademarks  and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to years  when purchased 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events  condition  and amounts of future cash flows
