for more focused studies  our array based solutions provide ideal tools to perform genome wide association studies gwas involving single nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping and copy number variation cnv analyses  as well as gene expression profiling and other dna  rna  and protein studies 
to further enhance our genetic analysis workflows  in january we acquired epicentre technologies corporation  a leading provider of nucleic acid sample preparation reagents and specialty enzymes for sequencing and microarray applications 
in  through our acquisition of helixis  inc  we expanded our instrument portfolio to include real time polymerase chain reaction pcr  one of the most widely used technologies in life sciences 
our financial results have been  and will continue to be  impacted by several significant trends  which are described below 
while these trends are important to understanding and evaluating our financial results  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item  part i of this report  and the other transactions  events  and trends discussed in risk factors in item a  part i of this report 
funding environment many of our customers receive funding from government agencies to purchase our instruments  products  and services 
there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the united states and europe  in particular  focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting slowing economic growth 
we estimate that approximately one third of our total revenue is derived  directly or indirectly  from funding provided by the us national institute of health nih 
after growing steadily through  the nih budget experienced an approximate reduction in fiscal  which ended on september   compared to fiscal based on the fiscal year congressional budget  the adjusted fiscal nih budget increased as compared to fiscal levels 
the significance and timing of any reductions to the nih budget beyond fiscal will be significantly impacted by the sequestration provisions of the budget control act of  which was enacted on august   and by whether these provisions remain in effect 
in addition  the us department of health and human services hhs  of which the nih is a part  has the ability to reallocate funds within its budget to spare the nih from the full effect of hhs budget reductions 
we continue to believe that allocations within the nih budget will continue to favor genetic analysis tools and  in particular  next generation sequencing 
we believe the uncertainty surrounding the levels of government and academic research funding in the united states and europe will continue in  which could lead to purchasing delays and could negatively impact our business 

table of contents next generation sequencing next generation sequencing has become a core technology for modern life science research 
over the next several years  expansion of the sequencing market  including an increase in the number of samples available  and enhancements in our product portfolio will continue to drive demand for our next generation sequencing technologies 
in  we launched new  higher throughput sequencing consumable kits that enable our customers to sequence a greater number of samples in a single instrument run 
we believe that this increased throughput created excess capacity that customers were unable to fully utilize due to a short term lack of available samples  which resulted in lower consumable sales per instrument and negatively affected sequencing instrument sales in the second half of we believe that this excess capacity will diminish as customers scale and gain access to greater numbers of samples 
with respect to sequencing instruments  we began commercial shipments in the third quarter of of our previously announced miseq  a low cost personal sequencing system that we believe will provide individual researchers a platform with rapid turnaround time  high accuracy  and streamlined workflow 
we believe miseq will expand our presence in the lower throughput sequencing market 
in january  we announced the hiseq sequencing system  which will allow customers to sequence an entire human genome in approximately a day up to gb in hours or gb per run 
full commercial shipments of the hiseq are expected to commence in the second half of with respect to sequencing consumables  we experienced an overall increase in sequencing consumable sales despite a decrease in the consumable revenue per instrument in compared to the increase in total sequencing consumable sales was driven by the growth of our sequencing installed base 
we believe the decrease in consumable revenue per instrument was driven  in part  by funding uncertainty and the excess capacity created from the higher throughput of our new sequencing kits 
as we continue to make improvements that reduce the cost of sequencing  we believe that more customers will use the hiseq platform  which generates more revenue per instrument time than the genome analyzer  and that the increased capacity from our higher throughput sequencing kits will be more fully utilized as additional samples become increasingly available over the next few quarters 
we believe that our sequencing consumable revenue will grow in future periods with the launch of miseq and the growth in our hiseq installed base 
microarrays as a complement to next generation sequencing  we believe microarrays offer a less expensive  faster  and highly accurate technology for use when genetic content is already known 
the information content of microarrays is fixed and reproducible 
as such  microarrays provide repeatable  standardized assays for certain subsets of nucleotide bases within the overall genome 
we believe that focused studies will drive future microarray sales growth  however  as the per genome cost of sequencing continues to decrease  researchers will migrate certain whole genome array studies to sequencing at some point in the future 
in mid  we began shipments of the omni beadchip  a four sample microarray featuring more than million markers per sample with flexibility to include up to  custom markers 
this product includes a majority of the rare variant content from the genomes project  an international research effort launched in to establish the most detailed catalog of human genetic variation 
although the order and revenue level of microarray products fluctuated during  we received record microarray orders  driven by infinium exome array products  in the fourth quarter of financial overview financial highlights for include the following net revenue grew by during compared to the increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase in consumable sales as our installed base increased in  the launch of miseq in the third quarter of  and increased hiseq instrument revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue gross margin was in  an increase from in the increase primarily resulted from improvements in instrument and consumable gross margins 
instrument gross margin improved during the period due to higher average selling prices and consumable gross margin improved due to a shift in sales mix from microarray consumables to sequencing consumables  which have a higher gross margin than microarray consumables 
we believe our gross margin in future periods will depend on several factors  including market conditions that may impact our pricing power  product mix changes between consumable and instrument sales  our cost structure for manufacturing operations  and our ability to create innovative and high premium products that meet or stimulate customer demand 
income from operations decreased in compared to primarily due to a increase in total 
table of contents operating expenses  which was primarily driven by headquarter relocation expense and restructuring charges recorded in in  we relocated our headquarters to another facility in san diego  california and incurred million in headquarter relocation expense  which included a cease use loss upon vacating our prior headquarters  accelerated depreciation of certain property and equipment  and double rent expense during the transition to the new facility 
we expect to incur additional headquarter relocation expense during the first half of on october   we announced restructuring plans to reduce our global workforce by approximately employees  or approximately  and to consolidate certain facilities 
as a result of the restructuring effort  we recorded a restructuring charge of million during the fourth quarter of  comprised primarily of severance pay and other employee separation costs 
we expect to incur additional restructuring charges related to this effort through the second quarter of in addition  on january   ckh acquisition corp 
and roche holding ltd 
together  roche made an unsolicited tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of our common stock for per share 
roche also announced that it intends to oppose the re election of four directors serving on our board of directors whose terms expire at the annual meeting of stockholders  including the chairman of the board and our chief executive officer 
in connection with the roche tender offer  four stockholder class action lawsuits have been filed against us  and we anticipate that additional lawsuits may be filed 
as a result  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase during  as we anticipate incurring significant legal  advisory  proxy solicitation  and other costs as a result of this tender offer 
our effective tax rate was in  as compared to in the provision for income taxes is dependent on the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates and the other factors discussed in the risk factor we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and the possible loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding convertible notes in item a of this report 
for and beyond  we anticipate the provision for income taxes to increase in absolute dollars but the effective tax rate to trend lower than the us federal statutory rate as the portion of our earnings subject to lower statutory tax rates increases

compared to consumable revenue increased million  or  to million for compared to million for microarray consumable revenue  which constituted more than half of our total consumable revenue in and  increased million primarily attributable to growth in sales of our infinium beadchips  which constituted a majority of our microarray consumable sales 
sales volume of our infinium beadchip products increased on a per sample basis during compared to the average selling price per sample  however  declined due to a change in product mix primarily attributable to growth in sales of our focused content arrays and a number of large sample volume purchase orders that incurred higher discounts 
revenue from sequencing consumables increased million due to growth in the installed base of our sequencing systems 
revenue from sales of instruments increased million  or  to million for compared to million for sequencing instrument revenue increased million 
we experienced increases in both the number of units sold and average selling prices per unit for our sequencing systems during compared to unit growth was due to increased demand for next generation sequencing systems 
the increase in average selling prices was primarily attributable to the launch of the hiseq in q microarray instrument revenue increased million primarily attributable to strong demand for our hiscansq instrument launched in the launch of this system resulted in increases in both the number of units sold and average selling prices per unit for our microarray instruments during compared to the increase in service and other revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in instrument service contract revenue for our growing installed base of sequencing systems

the gross margin of our consumable sales also increased as we experienced a shift in sales mix from lower gross margin microarray consumables to higher gross margin sequencing consumables  primarily due to the expansion of our sequencing instrument installed base 
the improvements in gross margins were partially offset by the negative impact from higher stock compensation expense and higher amortization expense of acquired intangible assets included in cost of revenue 
compared to the decrease in gross margin in compared to was primarily attributable to the effect of discounts provided to customers on the sales of hiseq associated with promotional programs  including the genome analyzer trade in program

personnel expenses included salaries  share based compensation  and benefits 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in from was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel expenses of million associated with the growth of our business during the period 
the remaining increase was primarily driven by a million increase in bad debt expenses as a result of customer bankruptcies  and a million increase in supplies  repairs  and maintenance expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a legal settlement gain of million  representing the payment we received to settle an outstanding commercial dispute 
in  we relocated our headquarters to another facility in san diego  california and incurred million in headquarter relocation expense  which included a cease use loss upon vacating our prior headquarters  accelerated depreciation of certain property and equipment  and double rent expense during the transition to the new facility

table of contents liquidity we manage our business to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of our liquidity 
our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating  investing  and financing needs 
historically  we have issued debt and equity securities to finance our requirements to the extent that cash provided by operating activities was not sufficient to fund our needs 
at january   we had approximately billion in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
our short term investments include marketable securities consisting of debt securities in government sponsored entities  corporate debt securities  and us treasury notes 
cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries at january  were approximately million 
it is the company s intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in foreign subsidiaries 
during the first half of  we issued million in principal amount of convertible senior notes that mature march  we pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on march and september of each year 
in  we issued million in principal of convertible senior notes that mature february  we pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on february and august of each year 
additional information about the convertible notes  including their conversion features  is described in note convertible senior notes in part i  item  of this form k 
as of january   the principal amounts of our convertible senior notes due and our convertible senior notes due were million and million  respectively 
during  we used part of the net proceeds from the issuance of our convertible senior notes due for the extinguishment of million principal amount of our existing convertible senior notes due upon conversion 
we will continue to use the net proceeds from the issuance of our convertible senior notes due for future debt extinguishment 
in addition  we used an additional million of the net proceeds to purchase million shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the issuance 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds for other general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions and additional purchases of our common stock 
our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  include expenditures related to potential strategic acquisitions and investments  support of commercialization efforts related to our current and future products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources both in the united states and abroad  repurchases of our outstanding common stock  the continued advancement of research and development efforts  acquisitions of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities  and the expansion needs of our facilities  including costs of leasing additional facilities 
we expect that our revenue and the resulting operating income  as well as the status of each of our new product development programs  will significantly impact our cash management decisions 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next months  barring unforeseen circumstances 
operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business  including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
at the present time  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully commercialize and further develop our technologies and create innovative products in our markets  scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs  competing technological and market developments  and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
during the fiscal year ended january   we were not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of the rules of the sec 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of january   aggregated by type amounts in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligation total year years years years debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations amounts due under executive deferred compensation plan total the table excludes million of uncertain tax benefits 
we have not included this amount in the table because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities  if any 
see note income taxes in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion of our uncertain tax positions 
the table also excludes million in potential contingent consideration payments related to acquisitions 
we have not included this amount in the table because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding whether the milestones required for these payments will be achieved 
see note acquisitions in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion of our contingent consideration 
debt obligations include the principal amount of our convertible senior notes due and  as well as interest payments to be made under the notes 
although these notes mature in and respectively  they can be converted into cash and shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met 
any conversion prior to maturity can result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as indicated in the table

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  market and other conditions  and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future  the estimation process is  by its nature  uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control 
if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate  our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected 
in addition  if our assumptions change  we may need to revise our estimates  or take other corrective actions  either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments 
in addition  had we used estimates different from any of these  our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented 
members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates  and our disclosure regarding them  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note organization and significant accounting policies in part ii  item of this form k 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services 
product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis 
service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing services  instrument service contract sales  and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants  which are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgments and estimates and actual results may differ from our estimates 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required  revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met 
all revenue is recorded net of any discounts 
revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer  provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned  which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached 
in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable  we evaluate whether refund rights exist 
if there are refund rights or payment terms based on future performance  we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 
we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products or services 
these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame  approximately three to six months  of the contract execution date 
revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items are considered to have stand alone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a stand alone basis 
for transactions with multiple deliverables  consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists  we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
in order to establish vsoe of selling price  we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range 
vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range 
if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined  then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price 
due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry  we have rarely established selling price using third party evidence 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions 
if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient  we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
in the first quarter of  we offered an incentive with the launch of the hiseq that enabled existing genome analyzer customers to trade in their genome analyzer and receive a discount on the purchase of a hiseq the incentive was limited to customers who had purchased a genome analyzer as of the date of the announcement and was the first significant trade in program we have offered 
the genome analyzer trade in program was completed in we accounted for hiseq discounts related to the genome analyzer trade in program as reductions to revenue upon recognition of the hiseq sales revenue  which is later than the date the trade in program was launched 
in certain markets within europe  the asia pacific region  latin america  the middle east  and south africa  the company sells products and provides services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products 
in most sales through distributors  the product is delivered directly to customers 
in cases where the product is delivered to a distributor  revenue 
table of contents recognition is deferred until acceptance is received from the distributor  and or the end user  if required by the applicable sales contract 
the terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers 
these transactions are accounted for in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy described herein 
investments we invest in various types of securities  including debt securities in government sponsored entities  corporate debt securities  and us treasury securities 
as of january   we have million in short term investments 
in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements  we classify our investments as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 
as noted in note fair value measurements in part ii  item of this form k  a majority of our security holdings have been classified as level these securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a third party service provider who assesses the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly  such as  yield curve  volatility factors  credit spreads  default rates  loss severity  current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt  broker and dealer quotes  as well as other relevant economic measures 
we perform certain procedures to corroborate the fair value of these holdings  and in the process  we apply judgments and estimates that if changed  could significantly affect our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding  review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our gross trade accounts receivables totaled million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at january  our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete  or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value 
we must make assumptions about future demand  market conditions  and the release of new products that will supersede old ones 
we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components  taking into account product life cycles  quality issues  historical experience  and usage forecasts 
our gross inventory totaled million and the cumulative adjustment for potentially excess and obsolete inventory was million at january  historically  our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses 
however  if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters 
we routinely assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  to the extent losses are reasonably estimable 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
disclosure for specific legal contingencies will be provided if the likelihood of occurrence is probable  or reasonably possible  and the exposure is considered material to our consolidated financial statements 
management considers many factors in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters 
these factors include  but are not limited to  past history  scientific and other evidence  and the specifics and status of each matter 
we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes  which may result in the recording of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual 
predicting the outcome of claims and litigation  and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals 
business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting  we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of 
table of contents acquisition 
the fair values assigned  defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants  are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management 
we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets  net of liabilities assumed  as goodwill 
these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
in connection with certain of our acquisitions  additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones 
in these cases  a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing variable factors such as anticipated future cash flows  risk free adjusted discount rates  and nonperformance risk 
any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition related gain expense  net  a component of operating expenses  in our consolidated statements of income 
this method requires significant management judgment  including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates 
future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains 
management uses a discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our long lived assets are impaired 
a review of intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long lived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows associated with such assets 
in order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives  we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets 
the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows  the time value of money  and other factors that a willing market participant would consider 
significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
for example  if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units  we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets 
impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
share based compensation we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of fair value of share based awards using the bsm model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income 
these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price  expected life of an award  expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate 
we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock 
the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally 
table of contents commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards  adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur  and other relevant factors 
implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchange traded call options on our common stock 
the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience  exercise activity  and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards 
we determined expected dividend yield to be given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share based awards 
we amortize the fair value of share based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 
warranties we generally provide a one year warranty on instruments 
additionally  we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date  which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date 
we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance 
we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve  and adjust  if necessary  the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred 
if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense 
cease use loss upon exit of facility in  we relocated our headquarters to a new facility in san diego  california  and recorded headquarter relocation expense of million  which included a cease use loss of million recorded upon vacating certain buildings of our prior headquarter facility 
the lease on our prior headquarter facility expires in the cease use loss is calculated as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period  adjusted for deferred items and leasehold improvements 
in calculating the cease use loss  management is required to make significant judgments to estimate the present value of future cash flows from the assumed sublease 
the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts  and the risk adjusted discount rate 
these assumptions are subjective in nature and the actual future cash flows could differ from our estimates  resulting in significant adjustments to the cease use loss recorded or to be recorded 
income taxes our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the united states and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
changes in tax laws  statutory tax rates  and estimates of the company s future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 
deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence 
factors reviewed include the cumulative pre tax book income for the past three years  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts  projections of pre tax book income over the foreseeable future  and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
based on the available evidence as of january   we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us deferred tax assets will be realized 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain us deferred tax assets 
we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of the company s return filing positions 
due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability 
these differences  as well as any interest and penalties  will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents interest rate sensitivity our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio  and we believe a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
in addition  if a basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in  our interest income would change by approximately million in relation to amounts we would expect to earn  based on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as of january  changes in interest rates may also impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes 
during  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due at our election  the notes are convertible into cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in each case under certain circumstances  including trading price conditions related to our common stock 
if the trading price of our common stock reaches a price for a sustained period at above the conversion price of  the notes will become convertible 
upon conversion  we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value 
the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our then current incremental borrowing rate 
if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes  we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted 
the implicit interest rate for the notes is 
an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of million aggregate principal amount of the notes would result in a loss of approximately million 
market price sensitive instruments in order to reduce potential equity dilution  in connection with the issuance and potential conversion of our convertible senior notes due  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions  entitling us to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
in addition  we sold to the hedge transaction counterparties warrants exercisable on a net share basis  for up to  shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the anti dilutive effect of the note hedge transactions  if any  could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants  which occur during  assuming the warrants are exercised 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the company s us dollar functional currency 
these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash 
our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro  yen  british pound sterling  australian dollar  and singapore dollar 
both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income 
we recorded an immaterial net currency exchange loss for the fiscal year ended january   and a gain of million for the fiscal year ended january  on business transactions  net of hedging transactions  which are included in other expense income  net  in our consolidated statements of income 
we use forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency exposure risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures  and they generally have terms of one month or less 
realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income  as they have not been designated for hedge accounting 
these contracts  which settle monthly  effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled  so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities 
at january   we had million of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge foreign currency risk
