item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified below  and those discussed in the section titled risk factors included elsewhere in this report

throughout this discussion  unless the context specifies or implies otherwise  the terms company  oncothyreon  biomira  we  us and our refer to oncothyreon inc  its predecessor  biomira inc  and its subsidiaries 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer 
our goal is to develop and commercialize novel synthetic vaccines and targeted small molecules that have the 
table of contents potential to improve the lives and outcomes of cancer patients 
our cancer vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells  while our small molecule compounds are designed to inhibit the activity of specific cancer related proteins 
we are advancing our product candidates through in house development efforts and strategic collaborations 
our lead product candidate  stimuvax  is a cancer vaccine being evaluated in two phase clinical trials for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we have granted an exclusive  worldwide license to merck kgaa of darmstadt  germany  or merck kgaa  for the development  manufacture and commercialization of stimuvax 
merck kgaa has completed enrollment of patients in the phase start trial of stimuvax in nsclc and is currently expected to report the primary efficacy data in we have also filed an investigational new drug application for ont  a cancer vaccine directed against a target similar to stimuvax  and which is proprietary to us 
in addition to our vaccine product candidates  we have developed novel vaccine technology we may further develop ourselves and or license to others 
our most advanced targeted small molecule is px  for which we are currently conducting four phase trials in a variety of cancer indications 
px is an irreversible  pan isoform phosphatidylinositol kinase pi k inhibitor we obtained when we acquired from prolx pharmaceuticals corporation in we are also developing ont  a preclinical pan inhibitor of the b cell lymphoma  or bcl  family of anti apoptotic proteins 
overexpression of one or more of the bcl family of proteins is common in most human cancers 
we obtained rights to ont as part of an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with sanford burnham medical research institute 
as of the date of this report  we have not licensed any rights to our small molecules to any third party and retain all development  commercialization and manufacturing rights 
see note collaborative and license agreements for additional information 
we believe the quality and breadth of our product candidate pipeline  strategic collaborations and scientific team will potentially enable us to become an integrated biopharmaceutical company with a diversified portfolio of novel  commercialized therapeutics for major diseases 
in may  we entered into a collaborative arrangement with merck kgaa to pursue joint global product research  clinical development and commercialization of stimuvax 
the collaboration covered the entire field of oncology for this product candidate and was documented in collaboration and supply agreements  which we refer to as the agreements 
in connection with the execution of the collaboration and supply agreements  we received up front cash payments of million and million  respectively 
in january  we and merck kgaa entered into a binding letter of intent  pursuant to which the agreements were amended and we granted additional rights to merck kgaa 
in august  we amended and restated our collaboration and supply agreements with merck kgaa  which we refer to as the agreements  which restructured the agreements and formalized the terms set forth in the letter of intent 
as a result of the agreements  merck kgaa obtained an exclusive world wide license with respect to the development and commercialization of stimuvax 
we had responsibility for the development of the manufacturing process and plans for the scale up for commercial manufacturing and merck kgaa had the right to act as a secondary manufacturer of stimuvax 
we also continued to be responsible for manufacture of the clinical and commercial supply of stimuvax for which merck kgaa agreed to pay us our cost of goods and provisions for certain contingent payments to us related to manufacturing scale up and process transfer were added 
the entry into the agreements triggered a million payment to us contemplated by the letter of intent  which we received in september in addition  under the 
table of contents agreements  we were entitled to receive a million payment tied to the transfer of certain assays and methodology related to the manufacture of stimuvax  which we received in december  a million payment tied to the transfer of certain stimuvax manufacturing technology  which we received in may  and a million payment tied to the earlier of receipt of the first manufacturing run at commercial scale of stimuvax and december   which we received in december  various additional contingent payments up to a maximum of million in the aggregate tied to a biologics license application  or bla  submission for first and second cancer indications  for regulatory approval of first and second cancer indications  and for various sales milestones  royalties in the low twenties based on net sales outside of north america and royalties based on net sales inside of north america with percentages in the mid twenties  depending on the territory in which the net sales occur 
if the manufacturing process payments due by december  were paid in full  the royalty rates would be reduced in all territories by  relative to the agreements and the letter of intent 
in december  we entered into a license agreement with merck kgaa which replaced the agreements 
pursuant to the license agreement  in addition to the rights granted pursuant to the agreements  we licensed to merck kgaa the exclusive right to manufacture stimuvax and the right to sublicense to other persons all such rights licensed  we transferred certain manufacturing know how to merck kgaa  we agreed not to develop any product  other than ont  that is competitive with stimuvax and we granted to merck a right of first negotiation in connection with any contemplated collaboration or license agreement with respect to the development or commercialization of ont upon the execution of the license agreement  all of our future performance obligations related to the collaboration for the clinical development and development of the manufacture process of stimuvax were removed and our continuing involvement in the development and manufacturing of stimuvax ceased 
in return for the license of manufacturing rights and transfer of manufacturing know how  we received an up front cash payment of approximately million 
the provisions with respect to contingent payments under the agreements remained unchanged and we may receive cash payments of up to million  which figure excludes the million received in december and million received prior to the execution of the license agreement 
we are also entitled to receive royalties based on net sales of stimuvax ranging from a percentage in the mid teens to high single digits  depending on the territory in which the net sales occur 
royalty rates were reduced relative to prior agreements by a specified amount which we believe is consistent with our estimated costs of goods  manufacturing scale up costs and certain other expenses assumed by merck kgaa 
in connection with the entry into the license agreement  we also entered into an asset purchase agreement  which  together with the license agreement we refer to as the agreements  pursuant to which we sold to merck kgaa certain assets related to the manufacture of  and inventory of  stimuvax  placebo and raw materials  and merck kgaa agreed to assume certain liabilities related to the manufacture of stimuvax and our obligations related to the lease of our edmonton  alberta  canada facility 
the plant and equipment in the edmonton facility and inventory of raw materials  work in process and finished goods were sold for a purchase price of million including the assumption of lease obligation of  and million  respectively 
the purchase price of the inventory was first offset against advances made in prior periods resulting in net cash to us of million 
in addition  employees at our former edmonton facility were transferred to an affiliate of merck kgaa  significantly reducing our operating expenses related to this program

table of contents we have not developed a therapeutic product to the commercial stage 
as a result  with the exception of the unusual effects of the transaction with merck kgaa in december  our revenue has been limited to date  and we do not expect to recognize any material revenue for the foreseeable future 
in particular  our ability to generate revenue in future periods will depend substantially on the progress of ongoing clinical trials for stimuvax and our small molecule compounds  our ability to obtain development and commercialization partners for our small molecule compounds  merck kgaa s success in obtaining regulatory approval for stimuvax  our success in obtaining regulatory approval for our small molecule compounds  and merck kgaa s and our respective abilities to establish commercial markets for these drugs 
any adverse clinical results relating to stimuvax or any decision by merck kgaa to discontinue its efforts to develop and commercialize the product would have a material and adverse effect on our future revenues and results of operations and would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
our small molecule compounds are much earlier in the development stage than stimuvax  and we do not expect to realize any revenues associated with the commercialization of our products candidates for the foreseeable future 
the continued research and development of our product candidates will require significant additional expenditures  including preclinical studies  clinical trials  manufacturing costs and the expenses of seeking regulatory approval 
we rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our preclinical studies  all of our clinical trials and all of the manufacturing of cgmp material 
we expect expenditures associated with these activities to increase in future years as we continue the development of our small molecule product candidates and ont we have incurred substantial losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit totaled million 
we incurred a net loss of million for compared to a net loss of million for in future periods  we expect to continue to incur substantial net losses as we expand our research and development activities with respect to our small molecules product candidates 
to date we have funded our operations principally through the sale of our equity securities  cash received through our strategic alliance with merck kgaa  government grants  debt financings  and equipment financings 
we completed financings in september  in which we raised approximately million in gross proceeds  in may  in which we raised approximately million in gross proceeds and in august  in which we raised approximately million in gross proceeds  from the sale of our common stock and the issuance of warrants 
in addition  in february  we entered into a loan and security agreement  which we refer to as the loan agreement  pursuant to which we incurred million in term loan indebtedness and  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  may incur an additional million in term loan indebtedness 
in may  we completed a financing  in which we issued an aggregate of million shares and generated net proceeds of approximately million 
in october  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a per share price of approximately resulting in net proceeds of million 
in november  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a per share purchase price of approximately resulting in net proceeds of million 
during  warrants with respect to  underlying shares of our common stock were exercised  resulting in gross proceeds of approximately million 
see the section captioned liquidity and capital resources and note notes payable of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information 
because we have limited revenues and substantial research and development and operating expenses  we expect that we will in the future seek additional working capital funding from the sale of equity  debt securities  or loans or the licensing of rights to our product candidates 

table of contents key financial metrics revenue our revenue in and was immaterial  however  the types of revenues described in this section are relevant for historically  our revenue has been derived from payments under our collaborative and license agreements  our contract manufacturing activities  and miscellaneous licensing  royalty and other revenues from ancillary activities 
our arrangement with merck kgaa regarding stimuvax has historically contributed the substantial majority of our revenue 
licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements 
revenue from collaborative and license agreements consists of up front cash payments for initial technology access or licensing fees and contingent payments triggered by the occurrence of specified events or other contingencies derived from our collaborative and license agreements 
royalties from the commercial sale of products derived from our collaborative and license agreements are reported as licensing  royalties  and other revenue 
for more information on revenue recognition for licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements  see critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements below 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue consist of revenue from sales of compounds and processes from patented technologies to third parties and royalties received pursuant to collaborative agreements and license agreements 
royalties based on reported sales  if any  of licensed products are recognized based on the terms of the applicable agreement when and if reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for more information on revenue recognition for licensing  royalties  and other revenue  see critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition licensing  royalties  and other revenue below 
expenses research and development 
research and development consists of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies  and clinical trial and manufacturing costs 
these expenses include external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  technology access and licensing fees related to the use of proprietary third party technologies  employee and consultant related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation expense  benefits  and related costs  allocated facility overhead which includes depreciation and amortization  and third party supplier expenses 
for the periods covered by this report  we have recognized research and development expenses  including those paid to third parties  as they have been incurred 
we credit funding received from government research and development grants against research and development expense when such funding is received in the period when incurred 
these credits totaled million for the year ended december  this grant was a small business innovation research  or sbir  grant that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of prolx on october  funding for the sbir grants was completed in no sbir grants were received in and our research and development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a variety of reasons 
similarly  any of our continuing product candidates may be found to be ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to complete clinical trials than we have anticipated  
table of contents may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into collaboration or license agreements with larger third party pharmaceutical companies to complete the development and commercialization of our small molecule or other product candidates  and it is unknown whether or on what terms we will be able to secure collaboration or license agreements for any candidate 
in addition  it is difficult to provide the impact of collaboration or license agreements  if any  on the development of product candidates 
establishing product development relationships with large pharmaceutical companies may or may not accelerate the time to completion or reduce our costs with respect to the development and commercialization of any product candidate 
as a result of these uncertainties and the other risks inherent in the drug development process  we cannot determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of any of our product candidates 
similarly  we cannot determine when  if  or to what extent we may generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate 
the timeframe for development of any product candidate  associated development costs  and the probability of regulatory and commercial success vary widely 
as a result  we continually evaluate our product candidates and make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to specific candidates 
these determinations are typically made based on consideration of numerous factors  including our evaluation of scientific and clinical trial data and an ongoing assessment of the product candidate s commercial prospects 
we anticipate that we will continue to develop our portfolio of product candidates  which will increase our research and development expense in future periods 
we do not expect any of our current candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists principally of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation expense  and related costs for personnel in our executive  finance  accounting  information technology  and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal  consulting  accounting services and allocation of our facility costs  which includes depreciation and amortization 
investment and other income expense  net 
net investment and other income expense consists of interest and other income on our cash  short term investments  long term investments and foreign exchange gains and losses 
our investments consist of debt securities of u 
s government agencies  corporate debt securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
in  we were awarded a federal grant for million under the us government s qualifying therapeutic discovery project  or qtdp  program  which was recorded as other income since the amounts pertained to expenses incurred in and interest expense consists of interest incurred under our loan agreement with general electric capital corporation 
for more information  see note notes payable of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
change in fair value of warrants 
warrants issued in connection with our securities offering in september and may are classified as a liability due to their settlement features and  as such  were recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of the closing of the transaction 
the warrants are marked to market for each financial reporting period  with changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss in our statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of significant judgment and estimates for the inputs used in the model 
for more information  see note fair value measurements and note share capital of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents income tax benefit provision for income tax 
due to our history of significant losses  we do not recognize the benefit of net operating losses and have established a full valuation allowance since the realization of these benefits is not reasonably assured 
our income tax provision in relates to alternative minimum tax liability on the sale of manufacturing rights and know how to merck kgaa in december and the final process transfer payment received in in we recorded a tax benefit for recovery of taxes paid in the previous year and received payment in in  no provision for income taxes was recorded 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we have prepared this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been included in this report beginning on page f and which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make significant estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of our consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
the securities and exchange commission considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because they require critical management judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  goodwill impairment  stock based compensation  and warrant liability 
revenue recognition our revenue in and was immaterial  however  the types of revenues described in this section are relevant for we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we evaluate revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables to determine whether the deliverables represent one or more units of accounting 
revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  through december  have been accounted for in accordance with accounting standards that state that a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting if the following separation criteria are met the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of any undelivered items  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  the delivery of undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control 
the relevant revenue recognition accounting policy is then applied to each unit of accounting 

table of contents effective january   we adopted new accounting guidance on a prospective basis and will no longer rely on objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the elements in a revenue arrangement in order to separate a deliverable into a separate unit of accounting 
we will instead use a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which will be used to determine the allocation of consideration to each unit of accounting under an arrangement 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
this new guidance will be applied by us to revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  beginning january  as of december   we have not applied these provisions to any of our revenue arrangements as we have not entered into any new  or materially modified any of our existing  revenue arrangements in we have historically generated revenue from the following activities licensing revenue from collaborative and license agreements 
revenue from collaborative and license agreements consists of up front cash payments for initial technology access or licensing fees and contingent payments triggered by the occurrence of specified events or other contingencies derived from our collaborative and license agreements 
royalties from the commercial sale of products derived from our collaborative and license agreements are reported as licensing  royalties  and other revenue 
if we have continuing obligations under a collaborative agreement and the deliverables within the collaboration cannot be separated into their own respective units of accounting  we utilize a multiple attribution model for revenue recognition as the revenue related to each deliverable within the arrangement should be recognized upon the culmination of the separate earnings processes and in such a manner that the accounting matches the economic substance of the deliverables included in the unit of accounting 
as such  up front cash payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the period of performance under the applicable agreement 
effective january   we adopted new accounting guidance for recognizing milestone revenue  which will be applied on a prospective basis 
consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone for research or development deliverables will be recognized in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved if the consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meets all the criteria for the milestone to be considered substantive at the inception of the arrangement  such that it i is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relates solely to past performance  and iii is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
the provisions of the new milestone revenue guidance apply only to those milestones payable for research or development activities and do not apply to contingent payments for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the result of a collaborative partner s performance 
our existing collaboration agreements entail no performance obligations on our part  and milestone payments would be earned based on the collaborative partner s performance  therefore  milestone payments under existing agreements are considered contingent payments to be accounted for outside of the new milestone revenue guidance 
we will recognize contingent payments as revenue upon the occurrence of the specified events  assuming the payments are deemed collectible at that time 
with respect to our arrangement with merck kgaa  we determined that the estimated useful life of the products and estimated period of our ongoing obligations corresponded 
table of contents to the estimated life of the issued patents for such product 
under the agreements  payments that we received were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period from the date of execution of the agreements to we chose that amortization period because  at the time  we believed it reflected an anticipated period of market exclusivity based upon our expectation of the life of the patent protection  after which the market entry of competitive products would likely occur 
payments received pursuant to the letter of intent and the agreements were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the remaining estimated product life of stimuvax  which was until upon entering into the agreements  all of our future performance obligations related to our collaboration with merck kgaa regarding stimuvax were removed and our continuing involvement in the development and manufacturing of stimuvax ceased  therefore  we recognized the balance of all previously recorded deferred revenue relating to our arrangement with merck kgaa 
similarly  our receipt of the final manufacturing process transfer milestone payment in december was recognized currently since we had no continuing obligations pursuant to such arrangement 
any future contingent payments we receive pursuant to the license agreement will be immediately recognized in revenue 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue 
licensing  royalties  and other revenue consists of revenue from sales of compounds and processes from patented technologies to third parties and royalties received pursuant to collaborative agreements and license agreements 
royalties based on reported sales  if any  of licensed products are recognized based on the terms of the applicable agreement when and if reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
as of the date of this report  we have not received any royalties pursuant to our arrangement with merck kgaa 
if we have no continuing obligations under a license agreement  or a license deliverable qualifies as a separate unit of accounting included in a collaborative arrangement  consideration that is allocated to the license deliverable is recognized as revenue upon commencement of the license term and contingent payments are recognized as revenue upon the occurrence of the events or contingencies provided for in such agreement  assuming collectability is reasonably assured 
goodwill impairment goodwill is carried at cost and is not amortized  but is reviewed annually for impairment on october of each year  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
as of december   we had one reporting unit and there was a substantial excess of fair value compared to the carrying value 
there were no impairment charges recorded for any of the periods presented 
stock based compensation we maintain a share option plan under which an aggregate of  shares of common stock underlie outstanding options as of december  and an aggregate of  shares of common stock were available for future issuance 
we maintain an employee stock purchase plan espp under which a total of  shares of common stock were reserved for sale to employees of the company 
as of december   there were  shares reserved for future purchases 
we maintain a restricted share unit plan under which an aggregate of  shares of common stock underlie restricted stock units  or rsus  as of december  and an aggregate of  shares of common stock were available for future issuance 
we have generally granted options to our employees and directors under the share option plan  and we have granted rsus to non employee directors under the rsu plan 
prior to the april  amendment to our share option plan  we granted options with an exercise price denominated in canadian dollars equal to the closing price of our shares on the toronto stock exchange on the 
table of contents trading day immediately prior to the date of grant 
on and after april   we granted options with an exercise price denominated in us dollars equal to the closing price of our shares on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant 
on and after june  the fair value of the restricted share units has been determined to be the equivalent of our common shares closing trading price on the date immediately prior to the grant as quoted on the nasdaq global market 
prior to june   the fair value was computed using the closing trading price on the date immediately prior to the grant as quoted in canadian dollars on the toronto stock exchange 
pursuant to an october amendment to the rsu plan  we are required to settle of the shares of our common stock otherwise deliverable in connection with the vesting of any rsu and deliver to each non employee director an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date 
the amendment is designed to facilitate satisfaction of the non employee directors income tax obligation with respect to the vested rsus 
this modification resulted in the rsus being classified as a liability 
the outstanding rsu awards are required to be remeasured at each reporting date  or until settlement of the award  and any changes in valuation are recorded as compensation expense for the period 
we use the closing share price of our shares in the nasdaq global market at the reporting or settlement date to determine the fair value of rsus 
we use the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for our share option plan and employee stock purchase plan awards  which requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions to determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
we recognize the value of the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest as expense over the requisite vesting periods on a straight line basis for the entire award in our consolidated statements of operations 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
historically we have based the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option on the yield available on government of canada benchmark bonds with an equivalent expected term 
subsequent to april   we use the yield at the time of grant of a us treasury security 
the expected life of options in years represents the period of time stock based awards are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting schedules and historical employee behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock for a period equal to the stock option s expected life 
warrant liability in may and september  we issued warrants to purchase  and  shares of our common stock respectively in connection with a registered direct offering of our common stock and warrants 
of the warrants issued in may   zero and  warrants were exercised in  and respectively 
these warrants are classified as liabilities due to potential cash settlement upon the occurrence of certain transactions specified in the warrant agreement related to the warrants and  in the case of the warrants issued in may  certain adjustments that may be made to the terms of the warrants if we issue or sell shares below the exercise price 
the september equity financing triggered certain adjustment provisions in the may warrants and  as a result  the aggregate number of shares underlying such unexercised warrants increased by  to  as of december  and the per share exercise price decreased from to 
pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreement  the terms of the warrants issued in may will not be further adjusted for any future transactions 
accordingly  the fair value of the warrants is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability  and such fair value is adjusted at each financial reporting period with the adjustment to fair value reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 

table of contents fluctuations in the assumptions and factors used in the black scholes model can result in adjustments to the fair value of the warrants reflected on our balance sheet and  therefore  our statement of operations 
in  we changed the way we estimated volatility when determining the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes model

results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated 
overview years ended december  in millions  except per share amounts revenue operating expenses other income expense  net change in fair value of warrant liability benefit provision for income tax net loss loss per share basic and diluted we incurred a net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in the increase in our net loss was primarily due to the increase in the fair value of our warrant liability  which was attributable principally to the increase in the price of our common stock 
in addition  the increase in our net loss was also due to higher expenses in research and development related to the development of px and ont this increase was partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses due to lower professional fees incurred in the net loss of million in compared to a net loss of million in was primarily driven by the decline in the fair value of our warrant liability  which was attributable principally to the decrease in the price of our common stock 
this was substantially offset by higher expenses in research and development related to the development of px and ont in addition  general and administrative expenses were higher due to higher professional fees incurred in depreciation and amortization expense of million and million were reclassified to research and development and general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and respectively  to conform to current year presentation 
see note significant accounting policies reclassifications elsewhere in this annual report on form k for more information 
based on our development plans for our small molecule and vaccine candidates we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
revenue years ended december  in millions licensing revenues from collaborative and license agreements we recognized million of previously deferred revenue relating to an agreement with prima biomed limited as we have no continuing performance obligations related to such 
table of contents agreement 
we did not receive any revenues during license revenue in included a million contractually obligated payment from merck kgaa 
we do not expect revenue from the license of stimuvax  if at all  until the submission by merck kgaa of the bla for the first indication 
research and development years ended december  in millions research and development the million  or  increase in research and development expenses for compared to was primarily driven by higher clinical trial expense of million due to greater activity related to the development of px compared to research and development expenses in also included a license payment of million to sbmri and higher salaries and benefits expense of million attributable to increased headcount 
preclinical and manufacturing development expenses were higher by million due to greater preclinical and manufacturing activity 
as we continue with our development on px and ont  we expect that our research and development costs will be higher in compared to the million  or  increase in research and development expenses for compared to was primarily driven by a million increase in contract laboratory services and contract manufacturing and lab supplies  related to the development of px and ont salaries and benefits and clinical trial expenses were higher by million and million  respectively  due to increased headcount and greater clinical trial activity 
grant revenue used to offset research and development expenses decreased to zero in from million in  since our activities related to the sbir grant ceased in general and administrative years ended december  in millions general and administrative the million decrease in general and administrative expenses for relative to was principally due to million lower professional fees incurred in the decrease was partially offset by higher director fees of million 
the october amendment to our rsu plan resulted in the rsus being classified as a liability 
the outstanding rsu awards are required to be remeasured at each reporting date  or until settlement of the award  and any changes in valuation are recorded as compensation expense for the period 
for more information  see note stock based compensation of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
during the year ended december   we recorded additional expense of million for rsus that were revalued upon settlement and million for outstanding rsus revalued at december  we expect general and administrative expenses to be higher in compared to  however  these expenses will be subject to fluctuations related to the changes in the fair value of the rsu liability 
the million increase in relative to was principally due to a million increase in professional fees incurred related to regulatory compliance in the first half of and a million increase in directors and officers insurance premiums

recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb issued new guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance simplifies how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
it allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the new guidance will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we have not adopted this standard or determined the impact of this standard on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
in june  fasb and the international accounting standards board  or iasb  updated the guidance on presentation of items within other comprehensive income 
in this update  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
for both options  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
this update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we have not adopted this standard  however  the adoption of this standard is only expected to impact the presentation of our financial statements  and not our results of operations or financial position 
in may  fasb and the iasb published converged standards on fair value measurement and disclosure 
the standards do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting 
the standards clarified some existing rules and provided guidance for additional disclosures the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise in a fair value measurement are relevant only when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets and are not relevant when measuring the fair value of financial assets or of liabilities  when measuring the fair value of instruments classified in equity for example  equity issued in a business combination  the entity should measure it from the perspective of a 
table of contents market participant that holds that instrument as an asset  and quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in level measurements should be included 
the amendments in this update are to be applied prospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  early application by public entities is not permitted 
the adoption of this standard is only expected to impact the presentation of our financial statements  and not our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk as of december  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our cash and cash equivalents were denominated in canadian dollars 
as a result  we are not exposed to any significant foreign exchange risk 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investment totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these assets as a result of changes in interest rates since a majority of these assets are of a short term nature 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
a basis points decline in interest rates  occurring january  and sustained throughout the period ended december   would have resulted in a decline in investment income of approximately million for that same period
