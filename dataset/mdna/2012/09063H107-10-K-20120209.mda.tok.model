risk factors 
overview as used herein  the terms we  us  our or the company refer to biomed realty trust  inc  a maryland corporation  and any of our subsidiaries  including biomed realty  lp  a maryland limited partnership of which biomed realty trust  inc is the parent company and general partner  which may be referred to herein as the operating partnership 
biomed realty trust  inc conducts its business and owns its assets through the operating partnership and operates as a fully integrated  self administered and self managed reit 
the operating partnership is focused on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
our tenants primarily include biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  scientific research institutions  government agencies and other entities involved in the life science industry 
our properties are generally located in markets with well established reputations as centers for scientific research  including boston  san francisco  maryland  san diego  new york new jersey  pennsylvania  and seattle 
we were formed on april  and completed biomed realty trust  inc s initial public offering on august  at december   we owned or had interests in a portfolio with an aggregate of approximately million rentable square feet 
factors which may influence future operations our long term corporate strategy is to continue to focus on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
as of december   our current consolidated operating portfolio was leased on a weighted average basis to tenants 
as of december   our current consolidated operating portfolio was leased on a weighted average basis to tenants 
the increase in the overall leased percentage was due to an increase in leased square feet related to increased leasing activity 
our current operating portfolio increased by approximately  rentable square feet  or  and total leased square footage increased by approximately million square feet  or  during the same period 
leases representing approximately of our leased square footage expire during and leases representing approximately of our leased square footage expire during our leasing strategy for focuses on leasing vacant space  negotiating renewals for leases scheduled to expire during the year  and identifying new tenants or existing tenants seeking additional space to occupy the spaces for which we are unable to negotiate such renewals 
we may proceed with additional new developments and acquisitions  as real estate and capital market conditions permit 
as a direct result of the recent economic recession  we believe that the fair values of some of our properties may have declined below their respective carrying values 
however  to the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life  it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the property s carrying value 
we presently have the ability and intent to continue to own and operate our existing portfolio of properties and estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation of the properties are expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying value of each property 
accordingly  we do not believe that the carrying value of any of our properties is impaired 
if our ability and or our intent with regard to the operation of our properties otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to fair value and such loss could be material 
redevelopment development properties we are actively engaged in the redevelopment and development of certain properties in our portfolio 
we believe that these activities will ultimately result in a return on our additional investment once the redevelopment and development activities have been completed and the properties are leased 
however  redevelopment and development activities involve inherent risks and assumptions relating to our ability to fully lease the properties 
our objective is to have these properties fully leased upon completion of the construction activities 
however  our ability to fully lease the properties may be adversely affected by 
table of contents changing market conditions  including periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  declining demand for life science office and laboratory space  local oversupply of real estate assets  or competition from others  any of which may diminish our opportunities for leasing the property on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we may fail to retain tenants that have leased our properties  or may face significant monetary penalties  if we do not complete the construction of these properties in a timely manner or to the tenants specifications 
further  our competitors with greater resources may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract tenants to their properties  which could put pressure on our ability to attract tenants at rental rates that will provide an expected return on our additional investment in these properties 
as a result  we may be unable to fully lease some of our redevelopment development properties in a timely manner upon the completion of major construction activities 
we also rely on external sources of debt and equity funding to provide capital for our redevelopment and development projects 
although we believe that we currently have sufficient borrowing capacity and will be able to obtain additional funding as necessary  we may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms or at all or we may be forced to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  which may require us to adjust our business and construction plans accordingly 
further  we may spend more time or money than anticipated to redevelop or develop our properties due to delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations or other unanticipated delays in the construction 
the following summarizes our consolidated properties under redevelopment at december  september  september  september  property current rentable square feet percent leased estimated in service date redevelopment medical center drive  q ardsley park  q research blvd  q total weighted average our estimate of the time in which redevelopment will be substantially complete 
we estimate that the projects will be substantially complete and held available for their intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activities 
we currently estimate that we will invest up to an additional million before the redevelopment of these properties is substantially complete 
lease expirations the following is a summary of lease expirations over the next ten calendar years for leases in place at december  this table assumes that none of the tenants exercise renewal options or early termination rights  if any  at or prior to the scheduled expirations september  september  september  september  september  year of lease expiration leased square feet percent of leased square feet current annualized base rent percent of current annualized base rent current annualized base rent per leased square feet in thousands month to month thereafter total portfolio weighted average 
table of contents the success of our leasing and development strategy will be dependent upon the general economic conditions and more specifically real estate market conditions and life science industry trends in the united states and in our target markets of boston  san francisco  san diego  maryland  new york new jersey  pennsylvania and seattle and research parks near or adjacent to universities 
we cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be released at rental rates equal to or above the current contractual rental rates or at all 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they address the most material parts of our financial statements  require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
investments in real estate investments in real estate are carried at depreciated cost 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements remaining useful life  not to exceed years tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives or the terms of the related leases furniture  fixtures  and equipment to years acquired in place leases non cancelable term of the related lease acquired management agreements non cancelable term of the related agreement our estimates of useful lives have a direct impact on our net income 
if expected useful lives of our investments in real estate were shortened  we would depreciate the assets over a shorter time period  resulting in an increase to depreciation expense and a corresponding decrease to net income on an annual basis 
management must make significant assumptions in determining the value of assets and liabilities acquired 
the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase cost of the acquired properties could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 
the fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  buildings and improvements is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  buildings and improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets consisting of acquired in place leases and acquired management agreements are recorded based on a variety of considerations including  but not necessarily limited to the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in place leases ie the market cost to execute a lease  including leasing commissions and legal fees  if any  the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease up period ie real estate taxes and insurance  and the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease up period see discussion of the recognition of acquired above market and below market leases in revenue recognition  operating expenses and lease terminations section below 

table of contents the fair value assigned to the acquired management agreements are recorded at the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the management agreements acquired of the acquired management agreements with certain tenants of the acquired properties 
the values of in place leases and management agreements are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable period of the respective leases or agreements 
if a lease were to be terminated or if termination is determined to be likely eg  in the case of a tenant bankruptcy prior to its contractual expiration  amortization of all unamortized amounts related to that lease would be accelerated and such amounts written off 
costs incurred in connection with the development or construction of properties and improvements are capitalized 
capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other direct costs incurred during the period of development 
we capitalize costs on land and buildings under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy 
the determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
we consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction 
costs associated with acquisitions are charged to expense as incurred 
repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized 
repairs and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or increase its operating efficiency 
significant replacement and betterments represent costs that extend an asset s useful life or increase its operating efficiency 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the long lived asset s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in long lived assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
although our strategy is to hold our properties over the long term  if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to fair value and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
revenue recognition  operating expenses and lease terminations we commence revenue recognition on our leases based on a number of factors 
in most cases  revenue recognition under a lease begins when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased asset 
generally  this occurs on the lease commencement date 
in determining what constitutes the leased asset  we evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements 
if we are the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements  then the leased asset is the finished space and revenue recognition begins when the lessee takes possession of the finished space  typically when the improvements are substantially complete 
if we conclude that we are not the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements the lessee is the owner  then the leased asset is the unimproved space and any tenant improvement allowances funded under the lease are treated as lease incentives  which reduce revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining non cancelable term of the respective lease 
in these circumstances  we begin revenue recognition when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for the lessee to construct improvements 
the determination of who is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements determines the nature of the leased asset and when revenue recognition under a lease begins 
we consider a number of different factors to evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes 
these factors include whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent  whether the tenant or landlord retain legal title to the improvements  the uniqueness of the improvements  
table of contents the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the length of the lease  the responsible party for construction cost overruns  and who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements 
the determination of who owns the tenant improvements  for accounting purposes  is subject to significant judgment 
in making that determination we consider all of the above factors 
however  no one factor is determinative in reaching a conclusion 
all leases are classified as operating leases and minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in accrued straight line rents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and contractually due but unpaid rents are included in accounts receivable 
existing leases at acquired properties are reviewed at the time of acquisition to determine if contractual rents are above or below current market rents for the acquired property 
an identifiable lease intangible asset or liability is recorded based on the present value using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases at acquisition  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the leases and any fixed rate renewal periods 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
if a lease were to be terminated or if termination were determined to be likely eg  in the case of a tenant bankruptcy prior to its contractual expiration  amortization of the related unamortized above or below market lease intangible would be accelerated and such amounts written off 
rental operations expenses  consisting of real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs  are subject to recovery from tenants under the terms of our lease agreements 
amounts recovered are dependent on several factors  including occupancy and lease terms 
revenues are recognized in the period the expenses are incurred 
the reimbursements are recorded in revenues as tenant recoveries  and the expenses are recorded in rental operations expenses  as the company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the credit risk 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the recoverability of tenant balances  including rents receivable  straight line rents receivable  tenant improvements  deferred leasing costs and any acquisition intangibles 
when it is determined that the recoverability of tenant balances is not probable  an allowance for expected losses related to tenant receivables  including straight line rents receivable  utilizing the specific identification method is recorded as a charge to earnings 
upon the termination of a lease  the amortization of tenant improvements  deferred leasing costs and acquisition intangible assets and liabilities is accelerated to the expected termination date as a charge to their respective line items and tenant receivables are written off as a reduction of the allowance in the period in which the balance is deemed to be no longer collectible 
for financial reporting purposes  a lease is treated as terminated upon a tenant filing for bankruptcy  when a space is abandoned and a tenant ceases rent payments  or when other circumstances indicate that termination of a tenant s lease is probable eg  eviction 
lease termination fees are recognized in other revenue when the related leases are canceled  the amounts to be received are fixed and determinable and collectability is assured  and when we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
investments in partnerships and limited liability companies we evaluate our investments in limited liability companies and partnerships to determine whether such entities may be a variable interest entity  or vie  and  if a vie  whether we are the primary beneficiary 
generally  an entity is determined to be a vie when either the equity investors if any lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that has both the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
we consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance including  but not limited to  the ability to direct financing  leasing  construction and other operating decisions and activities 
in addition  we consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions  to replace or remove the manager of the entity and to liquidate or sell the entity 
the obligation to 
table of contents absorb losses and the right to receive benefits when a reporting entity is affiliated with a vie must be based on ownership  contractual  and or other pecuniary interests in that vie 
we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary in six vies  consisting of single tenant properties in which the tenant has a fixed price purchase option  which are consolidated and reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if the above conditions do not apply  we consider whether a general partner or managing member controls a limited partnership or limited liability company  respectively 
the general partner in a limited partnership or managing member in a limited liability company is presumed to control that limited partnership or limited liability company  as applicable 
the presumption may be overcome if the limited partners or members have either the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or limited liability company  as applicable  or otherwise remove the general partner or managing member  as applicable  without cause or substantive participating rights  which provide the limited partners or members with the ability to effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of the limited partnership s or limited liability company s business  as applicable  and thereby preclude the general partner or managing member from exercising unilateral control over the partnership or limited liability company  as applicable 
if these criteria are met and we are the general partner or the managing member  as applicable  the consolidation of the partnership or limited liability company is required 
except for investments that are consolidated  we account for investments in entities over which we exercise significant influence  but do not control  under the equity method of accounting 
these investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity in the investment is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and its share of net income or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated partnerships or limited liability companies may be impaired on a more than temporary basis 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment on a more than temporary basis 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the fair value of the investment 
management does not believe that the value of any of our unconsolidated investments in partnerships or limited liability companies was impaired as of december  assets and liabilities measured at fair value we measure financial instruments and other items at fair value where required under gaap  but have elected not to measure any additional financial instruments and other items at fair value as permitted under fair value option accounting guidance 
fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  there is a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
we have used interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk 
the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives  including the period to maturity  and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves 
the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts or payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments or receipts 
the variable cash payments or receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts  and guarantees 

table of contents derivative instruments we record all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
in determining the fair value of our derivatives  we consider our credit risk and that of our counterparties 
these counterparties are generally larger financial institutions engaged in providing a variety of financial services 
these institutions generally face similar risks regarding adverse changes in market and economic conditions  including  but not limited to  fluctuations in interest rates  exchange rates  equity and commodity prices and credit spreads 
the ongoing disruptions in the financial markets have heightened the risks to these institutions 
while management believes that our counterparties will meet their obligations under the derivative contracts  it is possible that defaults may occur 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risks  even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
if charges relating to the hedged transaction are being deferred pursuant to redevelopment or development activities  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative are also deferred in other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet  and are amortized to the income statement once the deferred charges from the hedged transaction begin again to affect earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
for derivatives that are not classified as hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized directly in earnings in the period in which the change occurs 
we are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions 
we principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities 
we manage economic risks  including interest rate  liquidity  and credit risk primarily by managing the amount  sources  and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments 
specifically  we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known or expected cash amounts  the value of which are determined by interest rates 
our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount  timing  and duration of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to our investments and borrowings 
our primary objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for making fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
during the years ended december   and  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt and future variability in the interest related cash flows from forecasted issuances of debt see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
we formally document the hedging relationships for all derivative instruments  have historically accounted for our interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges  and do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes

table of contents for the year ended december   we recorded bad debt expense of million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in bad debt expense related to amounts considered uncollectible as a result of a lease termination during the year ended december  as of december   we had fully reserved tenant receivables both accounts receivable and straight line rents for certain tenants that had not terminated their leases 
such tenants may be paying some or all of their rent on a current basis  but recoverability of some or all past due receivable balances is not considered probable 
depreciation and amortization expense

acquisition related expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in acquisition activities in as compared to the prior year 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated partnerships 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated partnerships increased  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increased loss primarily reflects the commencement of depreciation and cessation of interest capitalization on a vacant property that was under development in and subsequently placed into service 
interest expense  net 
interest cost incurred for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  total interest cost incurred increased primarily as a result of higher average debt balances outstanding during and increases in the average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings due to the issuance of new fixed rate indebtedness with a higher interest rate than the variable rate indebtedness it replaced  partially offset by the expiration of derivative instruments and repayment of certain higher coupon mortgage notes payable

table of contents other expense 
other expenses consisted of the following in thousands september  september  year ended december  loss on extinguishment of debt gain on revaluation of acquired unconsolidated partnerships other than temporary impairment of marketable securities loss on derivative instruments total other expense during the year ended december   we repaid in full outstanding mortgage notes totaling approximately million pertaining to the ardentech court  road to the cure  science center drive  sorrento west and towne centre drive properties 
this resulted in the recognition of a loss on extinguishment of debt representing prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred loan fees  partially offset by the write off of unamortized debt premium 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million face value of our notes due this repurchase resulted in the recognition of a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately  representing the write off of deferred loan fees and unamortized debt discount 
in addition  we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write off of approximately million of deferred loan fees and legal expenses as a result of the voluntary prepayment in full of million in outstanding borrowings under our secured term loan 
the gain on revaluation of acquired unconsolidated partnerships resulted from our acquisition of the remaining ownership of the rogers street assets from our prei joint venture in december significant declines in the value of investments in available for sale securities in two publicly traded companies we considered other than temporary resulted in the reclassification of an unrealized loss from other comprehensive income 
the loss on derivative instruments in both and reflects hedging ineffectiveness associated with certain interest rate derivative contracts 
lease termination 
during the year ended december   we recorded approximately million in lease termination income  which has been recorded as other income  related to an early lease termination at one of our properties 
consideration was in the form of marketable equity securities received from the former tenant and the recognition of previously deferred rental income related to the property
