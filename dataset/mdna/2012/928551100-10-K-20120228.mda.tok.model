the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview vivus  inc is a biopharmaceutical company  incorporated in as a california corporation and reincorporated in as a delaware corporation  dedicated to the development and commercialization of therapeutic drugs for large underserved markets  including obesity and related morbidities  such as sleep apnea and diabetes and men s sexual health 
obesity remains an epidemic and in the united states alone  the cdc estimates that over million people are obese or overweight 
in the european union estimates are that of adults are obese or overweight 
with respect to men s sexual health  annual sales of approved drugs for erectile dysfunction currently exceed billion 
currently  our investigational drug candidate  qnexa  is under review by regulators for approval as a treatment for obesity in the us and the european union 
on october   we received a crl regarding the nda for qnexa as a treatment for obesity 
the crl stated that in its current form  the nda for qnexa was not approvable 
the crl included the following areas clinical  labeling  rems  safety update  and drug scheduling 
in the clinical section of the crl  the fda  requested a comprehensive assessment of topiramate s and qnexa s teratogenic potential including a detailed plan and strategy to evaluate and mitigate the potential teratogenic risks in women of childbearing potential taking the drug for the treatment of obesity 
in addition  the fda asked us to provide evidence that the elevation in heart rate mean beats per minute on the top dose associated with qnexa does not increase the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events 
the fda requested that we formally submit the results from the completed sequel study ob  a week extension study for a subset of patients who completed the previously reported week conquer study 
the fda reserved the right to comment further on proposed labeling 
on rems  the fda requested that a discussion of an already submitted rems plan be continued after we submitted the written response 
the agency also requested a safety update of any new adverse events be submitted with the nda 
finally  the fda stated that if approved  qnexa would be a schedule iv drug due to the phentermine component 
no new clinical studies were requested in the crl 
on january   we held an end of review meeting with the fda to discuss the items contained in the crl and the information we planned to include in the resubmission of the nda for qnexa 
in anticipation of the meeting  we provided a briefing document that included comprehensive assessment of the teratogenic potential of topiramate including analyses integrating existing non clinical and clinical data 
in the qnexa studies  which included offspring from women exposed to qnexa or topiramate  there were no reports of any congenital malformations 
in addition  we provided several new analyses including cardiovascular data from our sequel ob and sleep apnea ob studies to demonstrate that qnexa does not increase the risk for major cardiovascular events and that the observed increases in heart rate  which occurred in some patients over the course of the clinical program  did not increase the risk of major cardiovascular events  as evidenced by adverse events reported in the trial 
we also provided a synopsis of the final study report for the sequel study 
at the meeting  an overview was provided of the teratogenicity and cardiovascular risk material covered by the background package 
the discussion also included elements of our proposed rems program for qnexa 
the primary focus of the fda at the meeting  however  concerned the teratogenic potential for topiramate  specifically the incidence of oral clefts observed in the north american aed pregnancy registry and in the uk epilepsy and pregnancy registry 
the fda requested that we assess the feasibility of performing a retrospective observational study utilizing existing electronic medical claims healthcare databases to review fetal outcomes  including the incidence of congenital malformations and 
table of contents oral cleft  in the offspring of women who received prophylaxis treatment with mg of topiramate for migraine during pregnancy  or the feasibility assessment 
we held a follow up meeting with the fda on april  to discuss the feasibility assessment 
we reached agreement with the fda on the retrospective observational study objectives and design  primary endpoints  and eligibility criteria 
during the april meeting  it was agreed the study would be expanded to include all doses of topiramate and all diagnoses 
it was also agreed that the results would be stratified and that the diagnoses of those exposed to topiramate would be matched with control groups with similar diagnoses and patient profiles 
the co primary endpoints were the relative risk of major congenital malformations and oral cleft in infants born to mothers exposed to topiramate during pregnancy as compared to a control group that was not exposed to topiramate during pregnancy 
the retrospective observational study was called fortress  for fetal outcome retrospective topiramate exposure study 
on september   we announced that following a teleconference we had reached agreement with officials of the division of metabolism and endocrinology products  or dmep  of the fda on a plan that allowed for an early resubmission of the qnexa nda for the treatment of obesity 
based on this agreement  we resubmitted the qnexa nda on october   prior to completion of fortress  and the fda accepted the nda for filing 
on february   the food and drug administration held a second meeting of the endocrinology and metabolic drugs advisory committee  or the advisory committee  to discuss the additional data submitted for qnexa 
the fda asked the advisory committee to discuss the following their interpretation of the available data regarding teratogenicity of topiramate  including whether they believe the data indicate an increase in the risk for oral clefts  the potential strengths and weaknesses of the proposed teratogenicity risk management strategy for qnexa  the clinical significance of the changes in blood pressure and heart rate in overweight and obese patients treated with qnexa versus placebo  taking into account the reported changes in antihypertensive therapy  and whether the available data for qnexa warrant that a cardiovascular outcomes trial be conducted prior to approval 
the fda requested the advisory committee to vote on whether  after considering all the available data included in the nda and the discussions held at the meeting on february   including the questions referred to above  the overall benefit risk assessment of qnexa supports its approval for the treatment of obesity in individuals with a bmi kg m or a bmi kg m with weight related co morbidities 
the advisory committee voted to to recommend approval 
the fda is not bound by the recommendations of its advisory committees  but will consider their guidance during the review of the nda that was submitted for qnexa in october the prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  target date for qnexa is april  the qnexa nda resubmission seeks approval for the treatment of obesity  including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss for obese patients bmi kg m  or overweight patients bmi kg m with weight related co morbidities such as hypertension  type diabetes  dyslipidemia  or central adiposity abdominal obesity 
the proposed labeling for qnexa submitted on october  included a contraindication that excluded the use of qnexa by women of childbearing potential 
the proposed pregnancy category is category x 
in january  we announced that following discussions with fda officials  we were asked to remove the qnexa contraindication for women of childbearing potential contained in the proposed label 
qnexa would remain contraindicated for women who are pregnant 
a contraindication typically indicates that a drug should not be used because the risk of use clearly outweighs any possible therapeutic benefit for that population 
included with the october  resubmission of the qnexa nda was a proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems 
we are currently revising our proposed rems based on the change in the contraindication 
we have discussed the submitted rems with the fda and the details of the qnexa rems were discussed during the endocrinologic and metabolic drugs advisory committee  held february  our resubmission of the nda for qnexa states that we plan to 
table of contents conduct a cardiovascular outcomes study post approval  and we have since submitted a draft protocol to the fda 
neither the details of this study  nor the rems  have been agreed to with the fda 
although no other requests for additional information or studies were made by the fda at these meetings or in the crl  there can be no assurance that the fda will not request or require us to provide additional information or undertake additional prospective studies or retrospective observational studies in connection with the qnexa nda 
top line preliminary results from fortress were announced in december fortress identified  mother infant dyads exposed to topiramate either alone monotherapy or in combination with other antiepileptic agents polytherapy in the first trimester of pregnancy  or the total topiramate cohort 
among the total topiramate cohort   dyads were exposed to topiramate monotherapy  or the topiramate monotherapy cohort 
there were oral clefts in the topiramate monotherapy cohort for a prevalence rate of 
this prevalence rate was compared to a control group of infants of women who had previously taken antiepileptic drugs including topiramate but not during the pregnancy of interest  or the formerly exposed cohort 
the prevalence rate for the formerly exposed cohort was 
the prevalence ratio for topiramate monotherapy cohort versus the formerly exposed cohort was center standardized  ci 
fortress analyzed data from a second control group  infants of women with similar medical profiles to the total topiramate cohort regardless of prior antiepileptic drug use the similar medical profile cohort 
there were oral clefts from a sample of  dyads in the similar medical profile cohort  for a prevalence of 
one data source reported an anomalously low prevalence of oral clefts in the sample from the similar medical profile cohort 
to investigate this finding  investigators performed repeated multiple re sampling from the group of dyads who were eligible for this cohort and determined that the oral clefts prevalence observed in the cohort was likely due to random error 
based on these findings  the fda requested that we utilize all of the available data in the entire similar medical profile cohort to determine the background prevalence of oral cleft 
using the entire similar medical profile cohort  the background prevalence of oc was found to be  and the prevalence ratio compared to the topiramate monotherapy cohort  standardized for center was ci 
as part of fortress  major congenital malformations  or mcms  are being evaluated 
the mcm analysis is ongoing 
the fortress findings are based on a claims only analysis 
all of the results of the study are considered to be preliminary until the results are validated 
the results will be final when validation is completed  which is expected in the third quarter of on december   we filed a marketing authorization application  or maa  with the european medicines agency  or ema  for qnexa controlled release capsules in the european union  or eu 
the proposed indication in the eu is for the treatment of obesity  including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss  and should be used in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric diet 
the ema s review of qnexa will follow their centralized marketing authorization procedure 
if approved  qnexa could receive marketing authorization in all eu member countries 
the maa was officially validated for central procedure on january  if approved in the eu  qnexa could be recommended for obese adult patients bmi kg m  or overweight patients bmi kg m with weight related co morbidities such as hypertension  type diabetes  dyslipidemia  or central adiposity abdominal obesity 
in europe  approximately million adults are considered overweight or obese  and the prevalence is rising rapidly 
according to ema guidelines for medicinal products used in weight control  a demonstration of weight loss of at least of baseline weight  which is at least statistically greater than that associated with placebo  is considered to be a valid primary efficacy criterion 
based on the results of the phase program  we believe qnexa has met this efficacy criterion set by the ema for obesity therapies 
in addition  the mean weight loss for the mid and top dose of qnexa at the end of two years was and  respectively  which we believe met the efficacy 
table of contents benchmark set by the ema for obesity therapies 
these results were shown to be associated with significant improvements in weight related co morbidities such as hypertension  dyslipidemia and diabetes 
the maa is comprised of data from over  overweight or obese patients with a broad range of weight related co morbidities 
two year  double blind data from sequel ob were also included in the filing to demonstrate durability of treatment response and long term safety 
in may  we received a response to our maa from the committee for medicinal products for human use  or chmp 
the response was in the form of the day questions 
the day questions covered a broad range of topics including  without limitation  issues relating to phentermine  which include historical concerns regarding its potential association with valvulopathy and pulmonary hypertension  heart rate and limited long term safety data in high risk patients  and known and suspected effects of topiramate which include cns and teratogenic potential 
the chmp also had questions concerning our proposed risk management plan for qnexa 
the day questions were consistent with the issues previously raised in the fda review process 
we met with representatives from the chmp in september to seek clarification on certain questions 
we submitted our response to the day questions in the fourth quarter of in january  we received the day list of outstanding issues  or day loi  from the chmp 
in order to perform additional analyses to allow further insights into the data as previously presented  we requested and have received a two month extension to respond to the day loi 
the day loi contained requests for additional information including risk minimization activities to address various issues relating to cardiovascular  neuropsychiatric and potential teratogenic effects of qnexa 
in addition  we were asked to discuss the benefit risk of the different doses of qnexa  its potential use in different patient populations  and the expected long term benefit of treatment with qnexa 
we are preparing our response  which we plan to submit in the second quarter of there can be no assurance that our response will be adequate or that our maa will be approved by the chmp 
in may  the journal of the american medical association published the results of a study entitled  newer generation antiepileptic drugs and the risk of major birth defects by ditte m lgaard nielsen  msc  anders hviid  msc  drmedsci jama 
 
the study was a population based cohort study of  live born infants in denmark from january   through september  individual level information on dispensed antiepileptic drugs to mothers  birth defect diagnoses  and potential confounders was obtained from compulsory nationwide health registries 
the main outcome measures were prevalence odds ratios pors of any major birth defect diagnosed within the first year of life by fetal exposure to antiepileptic drugs 
of the  infants exposed to lamotrigine  oxcarbazepine  topiramate  gabapentin  or levetiracetam newer generation antiepileptic drugs during the first trimester  were diagnosed with a major birth defect compared with  of the  who were not exposed to an antiepileptic drug vs 
 respectively  adjusted por 
apor   confidence interval 
ci  
for the topiramate subgroup  a major birth defect was diagnosed in five of infants exposed to topiramate apor   ci  
the study concluded that among live born infants in denmark  first trimester exposure to newer generation antiepileptic drugs  including topiramate  compared with no exposure  was not associated with an increased risk of major birth defects 
in july  abstracts for an international epilepsy conference including the top line results of an additional retrospective study of medical claims data on oral clefts  or ocs  and major congenital malformations  or mcms  associated with in utero topiramate exposure became available 
this study was conducted using medical claims and pharmacy prescription data from the wolters kluwer pharma solutions source lx patient longitudinal database  which identified mother infant dyads exposed to topiramate within months prior to giving birth 
the study compared the incidence rate of oc and mcm in topiramate exposed dyads to two control groups  one comprised of  dyads exposed to other antiepileptic drugs  or aeds  during pregnancy and a second of  dyads with a diagnosis of epilepsy with or without treatment  but no exposure to topiramate during pregnancy 
dyads exposed 
table of contents to known teratogens were excluded from all cohorts 
the results of the study found there were no statistically significant differences in oc or mcm frequency between the topiramate and control groups 
on august   during the international conference on pharmacoepidemiology therapeutic risk management  a new study assessing the risk of oral clefts in topiramate exposed pregnancies was presented 
the presentation entitled use of topiramate and the risk of oral clefts contained an analysis of data from two large databases including the cdc s national birth defects prevention study and the birth defect study from the slone epidemiology center at boston university  together the slone study 
data from this new study demonstrated no increase in relative risk of overall major malformations odds ratio  ci  which provides supporting evidence that topiramate is not a major teratogen 
the analysis did indicate an increased risk for oral cleft malformation may be associated with topiramate  however  we believe the magnitude of risk was substantially lower than data reflected in the current topiramate label 
the slone study provides alternative methodology to assess relative risk with topiramate 
the slone study assessed all malformations reported in two case controlled surveillance programs  the slone epidemiology center birth defects study  or sbds  and the cdc s national birth defects prevention study  or nbdps 
in contrast to other available studies  which assess relative risk based on total topiramate exposure  this analysis assessed the relative risk based on the proportion of identified malformations that were exposed to topiramate 
the study identified a total of approximately  major congenital malformations  from sbds and  from nbdps  including approximately  oral cleft malformations sbds and  nbdps 
topiramate exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy was reported in of the major malformations and seven of the oral clefts 
there were no reports of isolated cleft palate in the topiramate exposed pregnancies 
pooled data from the two databases showed a relative risk for oral cleft of ci 
results were pooled due to the small number of topiramate exposed pregnancies in the individual databases 
in the sbds data base  three topiramate exposed oral clefts were reported  producing a relative risk of ci 
in the nbdps data base  four topiramate exposed oral clefts were reported  producing a relative risk of ci 
the signal of potential risk from these new data is substantially lower than reported from the north american aed x and uk pregnancy x registries 
on august   during a poster session at the th international epilepsy congress iec in rome  italy  dr 
alison pack  associate professor of clinical neurology  columbia university medical center  presented the results of this study 
the incident rate of oc and mcm in the topiramate exposed group was compared to oc and mcm incident rates in three non topiramate exposed control groups an antiepileptic drug  or aed group  an epilepsy group  and a diabetes group 
the study found that there were no significant differences in oral clefts or major congenital malformations between the topiramate group and the aed or epilepsy groups 
the risk for mcms in infants born to diabetic mothers was significantly higher than the other cohorts  including the infants exposed to topiramate in utero 
the rates seen in the diabetes control group are comparable to that reported in the literature 
in all groups  known or suspected teratogens  including valproate and phenytoin  were excluded 
on september   a poster authored by dr 
mark w 
green  director of the center for headache and pain medicine and professor of neurology and anesthesiology at the mount sinai school of medicine  was presented at the american neurological association meeting in san diego  ca 
in addition to the topiramate exposure data previously reported  the results included the rate of mcms and ocs in two new control groups  a migraine without epilepsy group  and a sub group of patients exposed to acute and preventive migraine drugs  or apmd  during pregnancy 
the incident rate of oral clefts and major congenital malformations in the topiramate exposed group was compared to oc and mcm incident rates in three non topiramate exposed control groups a migraine without epilepsy group  a group of patients exposed to acute preventive migraine drugs  or apmd  during pregnancy  and a diabetes group 
the study found that the risk for mcms in infants born to diabetic 
table of contents mothers was significantly higher than seen in infants exposed to tpm in utero 
the mcm and oc rates seen in the diabetes control group are comparable to those reported in the literature 
consistency of these data compared to published references for the diabetes control group and the random sample provides assurance that this data would likely be representative of other clinical settings 
the study  funded by vivus  was conducted utilizing wolters kluwer datasets from the united states and followed patients pharmacy and medical claims births from january december and covered an estimated million lives 
probable exposure during pregnancy was refined using data on script fill date  days of medication supplied  infant birth date  and icd codes for birth term 
we included the results of this study in the october  resubmission of the qnexa nda 
a label update for topiramate was approved in july the updated label for topiramate reflects a lower than previously reported relative risk of oral cleft 
in march  based on data from the north american antiepileptic registry  the reported prevalence of oral cleft from topiramate exposure was as compared to a historical control of 
in july  the label was revised and now includes a prevalence rate for oral cleft of 
the historical control was corrected to  which is more in line with the expected background rate in the general population 
more importantly  the relative risk calculation dramatically improved from to at the same time  the rems for topiramate was discontinued as the fda determined that the medication guide  included as part of the labeling  adequately addressed public health risks 
in addition to qnexa  we have an investigational drug candidate  avanafil  to treat erectile dysfunction  or ed 
we have completed the phase clinical studies for avanafil and we filed an nda with the fda in june the nda has been accepted and we have a pdufa target date of april  in clinical studies  avanafil has demonstrated a fast onset of action  with full efficacy reported in some patients in as early as minutes after administration 
the unique profile of avanafil suggests that the compound may be selective 
greater selectivity can potentially result in lower incidence of the side effects associated with activation of non phosphodiesterase type  or non pde isozymes 
our future our goal is to build a successful biopharmaceutical company through the development and commercialization of innovative proprietary drugs 
we intend to achieve this by seeking regulatory approval for qnexa for the treatment of obesity in the us and the eu and other territories worldwide  seeking regulatory approval for avanafil for the treatment of ed in the us  the eu and other territories worldwide  establishing internal capabilities or strategic relationships with marketing partners to maximize sales potential for our drugs that require significant commercial support  and capitalizing on our clinical and regulatory expertise and experience to advance the development of investigational drug candidates in our pipeline 
it is our objective to become a leader in the development and us commercialization of drugs for large underserved markets 
we believe we have strong intellectual property supporting several opportunities in obesity and related disorders  such as sleep apnea and diabetes  and men s sexual health 
our future growth depends on our ability to further develop and obtain regulatory approval of our investigational drug candidates for indications that we have studied  or plan to study  as well as in licensing and product line extensions 
we have funded operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock  through the sale of the rights to evamist and through sales of our former product  muse alprostadil 

table of contents we expect to generate future net losses due to increases in operating expenses as our various investigational drug candidates are advanced through the various stages of clinical development and for pre commercialization activities 
in connection with the sale of evamist  to date we have received an aggregate of million 
on november   we sold muse to meda ab  for which we received an upfront payment of million upon the closing and are eligible to receive an additional million based on future sales of muse  provided that certain sales milestones are reached 
as of december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of million and expect to incur operating losses in future years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to available for sale securities  research and development expenses  income taxes  inventories  contingencies and litigation and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition license and other revenue we recognize license revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  as codified in the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  revenue recognition  or asc when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  as codified in fasb asc topic  subtopic multiple element arrangements  or asc in accordance with eitf  we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered element has stand alone value and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements  or such elements are insignificant 
application of this standard requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
revenue from non refundable  upfront license fees where we have continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the development or agreement period 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
on may   we closed our transaction with k v pharmaceutical company  or k v  for the sale of our investigational drug candidate  evamist  a metered dose transdermal spray for the treatment of menopause symptoms 
at the time of the sale  evamist was an investigational product and was not 
table of contents yet approved by the fda for marketing 
the sale transaction contained multiple deliverables  including the delivery at closing of the evamist assets mainly raw material inventory and certain fixed assets  a grant of a sublicense of our rights under a license related to evamist  and a license to the mdts applicator  the delivery upon receipt of regulatory approval of evamist  along with all regulatory submissions  and  lastly  the delivery after fda approval of certain transition services and a license to improvements to the mdts applicator 
we received approval from the fda to market evamist on july   or fda approval  and on august   we transferred and assigned the evamist fda submissions and all files related thereto to k v 
in august  we assigned all of our rights and obligations under the evamist license agreement to k v 
we received an upfront payment of million in may upon the closing and received an additional million milestone payment in august upon fda approval 
these payments are non refundable 
we evaluated this multiple deliverable arrangement to determine whether the deliverables were divided into separate units of accounting 
upon fda approval  the two remaining deliverables were the transition services to be performed under the transition services agreement  or tsa  and a license to improvements to the mdts applicator  or improvement license  during the two year period commencing with the closing  or may   and ending on may  we were able to establish fair value for the tsa 
as it relates to the improvement license  no specific value was assigned in the agreement 
we had no obligation to develop improvements to the mdts applicator and had no plans to expend significant resources in this endeavor 
however  we did not have objective  reliable evidence of fair value or evidence of inconsequential value to the customer of the improvement license 
accordingly  the delivered items  together with the undelivered items  were bundled together and were treated as one unit of accounting 
as a result  the initial million paid at closing and the million paid upon fda approval were recorded as deferred revenue and have been recognized as license revenue ratably over the month term of the improvement license  from august  to may  the revenue related to the transaction recognized for year ended december  was million 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu no 
amends the guidance for measurement and separation of deliverables in multiple element arrangements under eitf issue  as codified in fasb asc  and significantly increases the related disclosure requirements 
under this new guidance  which was effective for us beginning january   our accounting for the revenue from the sale of the evamist transaction may have been different 
research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses include license fees  related compensation  consultants fees  facilities costs  accrued milestones  administrative expenses related to r d activities and clinical trial costs at other companies and research institutions under agreements that are generally cancelable  among other related r d costs 
we also record accruals for estimated ongoing clinical trial costs 
clinical trial costs represent costs incurred by clinical research organizations  or cros  and clinical sites and include advertising for clinical trials and patient recruitment costs 
these costs are recorded as a component of r d expenses and are expensed as incurred 
under our agreements  progress payments are typically made to investigators  clinical sites and cros 
we analyze the progress of the clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

table of contents income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it is not more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets  we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  as of december   it was considered more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would recognize a benefit to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence  unmarketable or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our investigational product candidates do not receive approval  inventory write downs may be required 
cash and cash equivalents the company considers highly liquid investments with maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
at december   all cash equivalents are invested in money market funds and us treasury securities 
these accounts are recorded at fair value 
available for sale securities we focus on liquidity and capital preservation in our investments in available for sale securities 
our investment policy  as approved by the audit committee of the board of directors  allows us to invest our excess cash balances in money market and marketable securities  primarily us treasury securities and debt securities of us government agencies  corporate debt securities and asset backed securities 
we periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date 
our marketable securities have been classified and accounted for as available for sale 
we may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than months until maturity 
in response to changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative investments as well as liquidity requirements  we may sell these securities prior to their 
table of contents stated maturities 
as these securities are viewed by us as available to support current operations securities with maturities beyond months are classified as current assets 
securities are carried at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as a component of stockholders equity  unless the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary and we intend to sell such securities before recovering their costs  in which case such securities are written down to fair value and the loss is charged to other than temporary loss on impaired securities 
we evaluate our investment securities for other than temporary declines based on quantitative and qualitative factors 
any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined on a specific identification method  and such gains and losses are reflected as a component of interest income 
contingencies and litigation we are periodically involved in disputes and litigation related to a variety of matters 
when it is probable that we will experience a loss  and that loss is quantifiable  we record appropriate reserves 
we record legal fees and costs as an expense when incurred 
share based payments we follow the fair value method of accounting for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with sfas r  share based payment  as codified in fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  or asc we adopted sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method of transition 
under sfas r  the estimated fair value of share based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock units granted under our stock option plan and purchases of common stock by employees at a discount to market price under the employee stock purchase plan  or the espp  is recognized as compensation expense 
compensation expense for purchases under the espp is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the common stock purchase rights during each offering period and the percentage of the purchase discount 
we recorded million  million and million of share based compensation expense from continuing and discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
share based compensation expense is allocated among research and development  general and administrative expenses and discontinued operations based on the function of the related employee 
this charge had no impact on our cash flows for the periods presented 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the share based awards as of the grant date 
the black scholes model  by its design  is highly complex  and dependent upon key data inputs estimated by management 
the primary data inputs with the greatest degree of judgment are the estimated lives of the share based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price 
the black scholes model is highly sensitive to changes in these two data inputs 
the expected term of the options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived by analyzing the historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we determine expected volatility using the historical method  which is based on the daily historical trading data of our common stock over the expected term of the option 
management selected the historical method primarily because we have not identified a more reliable or appropriate method to predict future volatility

table of contents fair value financial instruments measured at fair value 
our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale financial instruments are carried at fair value and we make estimates regarding valuation of these assets measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurement definition and hierarchy 
asc defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
valuation technique 
asc establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of vivus 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
asc prescribes three valuation techniques that shall be used to measure fair value as follows market approach uses prices or other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flow amounts to a single present value amount discounted 
cost approach the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset ie  current replacement cost 
one or a combination of the approaches above can be used to calculate fair value  whichever results in the most representative fair value 
fair value measurements as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis totaled million 
all of our cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities are in cash  money market instruments and us treasury securities at december   and these are classified as level the valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of these financial instruments were derived from quoted market prices  as substantially all of these instruments have maturity dates  if any  within one year from the date of purchase and active markets for these instruments exists 
deerfield financing on april   we entered into several agreements with deerfield management company  lp  or deerfield  a healthcare investment fund  and its affiliates  deerfield private design fund lp and deerfield private design international  lp collectively  the deerfield affiliates 
certain of the agreements were amended and restated on march   which included the addition of deerfield pdi financing lp as a deerfield affiliate 
under the agreements  deerfield and its affiliates provided us with million in funding  consisting of million from the funding and royalty agreement  or fara  entered into with a newly incorporated subsidiary of deerfield  the deerfield sub  and million from the sale of our common stock 
under the fara  we paid royalties on the net sales of muse to the deerfield sub 
the fara had a term of years 

table of contents we entered into the option and put agreement with the deerfield affiliates and the deerfield sub  dated april   and an amended and restated option and put agreement dated march   or the opa 
pursuant to the opa  the deerfield affiliates granted us an option to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the deerfield sub from the deerfield affiliates  referred to as the option 
our obligation to pay royalties terminated upon the exercise of the option 
the base consideration for the option exercise  or base option price  was million  less million we paid upon closing  as the option was exercised on or prior to the third anniversary of the execution of the opa 
the aggregate consideration payable by us upon exercise of the option  or the option purchase price  was equal to the sum of the base option price  plus i the cash and cash equivalents held by the deerfield sub at the date of the closing of the resulting sale of the common stock of the deerfield sub  or the cash adjustment  ii accrued and unpaid royalties  or the royalty adjustment  and minus i the option premium of million that was paid at the closing of the transaction  or the option premium adjustment  ii accrued but unpaid taxes  iii unpaid funding payments  iv loans payable by the deerfield sub  or the loan balance adjustment  and v any other outstanding liabilities of the deerfield sub  or the adjusted option purchase price 
in preparation for the closing of the muse transaction and in accordance with the terms of the opa  we exercised the option  and on october  we paid an aggregate amount totaling million  which consisted of the base option price of million  less the option premium adjustment of million  plus the cash adjustment of million and the royalty adjustment of million 
these payments satisfied all of the financial obligations under the fara and opa 
as a result  all of the outstanding shares and the million of cash of the deerfield sub are owned by us  all of the outstanding loans owed by the deerfield sub have been repaid and the security interests in the collateral related to muse and avanafil held by the deerfield sub and the deerfield affiliates as part of the fara and opa were terminated 
in december  the deerfield sub was dissolved 
the payoff of the deerfield loan resulted in a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of million which was recognized in the fourth quarter of results of operations executive overview for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or net loss per share as compared to a net loss of million or net loss per share during the same period in for the year ended december   the net loss from continuing operations was million  or net loss per share and the net income from discontinued operations was  or net income per share 
for the year ended december   the decreased net loss from continuing operations  as compared to the year ended december   results primarily from decreased operating expenses in the decrease in operating expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to reduced research and development spending on qnexa for obesity and avanafil for erectile dysfunction  and decreased general and administrative expense primarily due to lower qnexa pre commercialization expenses 
in june  we submitted a new drug application  or nda  to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  seeking approval of avanafil for the treatment of ed 
the nda submission follows the successful completion of a phase program for avanafil  which included over  patients  where avanafil was shown to be well tolerated and effective in treating men with ed 
on october   we received a complete response letter  or crl  from the fda regarding the qnexa nda 
the fda issued the crl to communicate its decision that the nda could not be approved in its present form 
no new clinical studies were requested in the crl 
on january   we held an end of review meeting with the fda to discuss the items contained in the crl and the information we planned to include in the resubmission 
in anticipation of the meeting  we provided a 
table of contents briefing document that included comprehensive assessment of the teratogenic potential of topiramate including analyses integrating existing non clinical and clinical data 
in the qnexa studies  which included offspring from women exposed to qnexa or topiramate  there were no reports of any congenital malformations 
in addition  we provided several new analyses including cardiovascular data from our sequel ob and sleep apnea ob studies to demonstrate that qnexa does not increase the risk for major cardiovascular events and that the observed increases in heart rate  which occurred in some patients over the course of the clinical program  did not increase the risk of major cardiovascular events  as evidenced by adverse events reported in the trial 
we also provided a synopsis of the final study report for the sequel study 
at the meeting  an overview was provided of the teratogenicity and cardiovascular risk material covered in the background package 
the discussion also included elements of our proposed rems program for qnexa 
the primary focus of the fda at the meeting  however  concerned the teratogenic potential for topiramate  specifically the incidence of oral clefts observed in the north american aed pregnancy registry and in the uk epilepsy and pregnancy registry 
the fda requested that we assess the feasibility of performing a retrospective observational study utilizing existing electronic medical claims healthcare databases to review fetal outcomes  including the incidence of congenital malformations and oral cleft  in the offspring of women who received prophylaxis treatment with mg of topiramate for migraine during pregnancy  or the feasibility assessment 
in the qnexa studies  which included births from women exposed to qnexa or topiramate  there were no reports of any congenital malformations or low birth weight 
we met with the fda in april to discuss the feasibility assessment 
we reached agreement with the fda on the retrospective observational study objectives and design  primary endpoints  and eligibility criteria 
during the april meeting  it was agreed the study would be expanded to include all doses of topiramate and all diagnoses 
it was also agreed that the results would be stratified and that the diagnoses of those exposed to topiramate would be matched with control groups with similar diagnoses and patient profiles 
the co primary endpoints were the relative risk of major congenital malformations and oral cleft in the offspring of women exposed to topiramate during pregnancy as compared to a control group that was not exposed to topiramate during pregnancy 
the retrospective observational study was called fortress  for fetal outcome retrospective topiramate exposure study 
top line results from fortress were announced in december  with validation of fortress expected in the third quarter of there can be no assurance that the validation of this information will be successfully completed 
on september   we announced that following a teleconference we had reached agreement with officials of the division of metabolism and endocrinology products  or dmep  of the fda on a plan that allowed for an early resubmission of the qnexa nda for the treatment of obesity 
based on this agreement  we resubmitted the qnexa nda on october   prior to completion of fortress  and the fda accepted the nda for filing 
on february   the food and drug administration held a second meeting of the endocrinology and metabolic drugs advisory committee  or the advisory committee  to discuss the additional data submitted for qnexa 
the fda asked the advisory committee to discuss the following their interpretation of the available data regarding teratogenicity of topiramate  including whether they believe the data indicate an increase in the risk for oral clefts  the potential strengths and weaknesses of the proposed teratogenicity risk management strategy for qnexa  the clinical significance of the changes in blood pressure and heart rate in overweight and obese patients treated with qnexa versus placebo  taking into account the reported changes in antihypertensive therapy  and whether the available data for qnexa warrant that a cardiovascular outcomes trial be conducted prior to approval 
the fda requested the advisory committee to vote on whether  after considering all the available data included in the nda and the discussions held at the meeting on february   including the questions referred to above  the overall benefit risk assessment of qnexa supports its approval for the treatment of obesity in individuals with a bmi kg m or a bmi kg m with weight related co morbidities 
the advisory committee voted to to recommend approval 
the fda is not bound by the recommendations of 
table of contents its advisory committees  but will consider their guidance during the review of the nda that was submitted for qnexa in october the pdufa target date for qnexa is april  the qnexa nda resubmission seeks approval for the treatment of obesity  including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss for obese patients bmi kg m  or overweight patients bmi kg m with weight related co morbidities such as hypertension  type diabetes  dyslipidemia  or central adiposity abdominal obesity 
the proposed labeling for qnexa submitted on october  included a contraindication that excluded the use of qnexa by women of childbearing potential 
the proposed pregnancy category is category x 
in january  we announced that following discussions with fda officials  we were asked to remove the qnexa contraindication for women of childbearing potential contained in the proposed label 
qnexa would remain contraindicated for women who are pregnant 
a contraindication typically indicates that a drug should not be used because the risk of use clearly outweighs any possible therapeutic benefit for that population 
included with the october  resubmission of the qnexa nda was a proposed rems 
we are currently revising our proposed rems based on the change in the contraindication 
we discussed the submitted rems with the fda and the details of the qnexa rems were discussed during the endocrinologic and metabolic drugs advisory committee  held february  our resubmission of the nda for qnexa states that we plan to conduct a cardiovascular outcomes study post approval  and we have since submitted a draft protocol to the fda 
neither the details of this study  nor the rems  have been agreed to with the fda 
although no other requests for additional information or studies were made by the fda at these meetings or in the crl  there can be no assurance that the fda will not request or require us to provide additional information or undertake additional prospective studies or retrospective observational studies in connection with the qnexa nda 
on december   we filed a marketing authorization application  or maa  with the european medicines agency  or ema  for qnexa controlled release capsules in the european union  or eu 
the proposed indication in the eu is for the treatment of obesity  including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss  and should be used in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric diet 
the ema s review of qnexa will follow their centralized marketing authorization procedure 
if approved  qnexa could receive marketing authorization in all eu member countries 
the maa was officially validated for central procedure on january  if approved in the eu  qnexa could be recommended for obese adult patients bmi kg m  or overweight patients bmi kg m with weight related co morbidities such as hypertension  type diabetes  dyslipidemia  or central adiposity abdominal obesity 
in europe  approximately million adults are considered overweight or obese  and the prevalence is rising rapidly 
according to ema guidelines for medicinal products used in weight control  a demonstration of weight loss of at least of baseline weight  which is at least statistically greater than that associated with placebo  is considered to be a valid primary efficacy criterion 
based on the results of the phase program  we believe qnexa has met this efficacy criterion set by the ema for obesity therapies 
in addition  the mean weight loss for the mid and top dose of qnexa at the end of two years was and  respectively  which we believe met the efficacy benchmark set by the ema for obesity therapies 
these results were shown to be sustained over a two year period and were associated with significant improvements in weight related co morbidities such as hypertension  dyslipidemia and diabetes 
the maa is comprised of data from over  overweight or obese patients with a broad range of weight related co morbidities 
two year  double blind data from sequel ob were also included in the filing to demonstrate durability of treatment response and long term safety 
in may  we received a response to our maa from the committee for medicinal products for human use  or chmp 
the response was in the form of the day questions 
the day 
table of contents questions covered a broad range of topics including  without limitation  issues relating to phentermine  which include historical concerns regarding its potential association with valvulopathy and pulmonary hypertension  heart rate and limited long term safety data in high risk patients  and known and suspected effects of topiramate which include cns and teratogenic potential 
the chmp also had questions concerning our proposed risk management plan for qnexa 
the day questions were consistent with the issues previously raised in the fda review process 
we met with representatives from the chmp in september to seek clarification on certain questions 
we submitted our response to the day questions in the fourth quarter of in january  we received the day loi from the chmp 
in order to perform additional analyses to allow further insights into the data as previously presented  we requested and have received a two month extension to respond to the day loi 
the day loi contained requests for additional information including risk minimization activities to address various issues relating to cardiovascular  neuropsychiatric and potential teratogenic effects of qnexa 
in addition  we were asked to discuss the benefit risk of the different doses of qnexa  its potential use in different patient populations  and the expected long term benefit of treatment with qnexa 
we are preparing our response  which we plan to submit in the second quarter of there can be no assurance that our response will be adequate or that our maa will be approved by the chmp 
on october   we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with meda to sell certain rights and assets related to muse  transurethral alprostadil  for the treatment of erectile dysfunction  or the muse transaction 
meda had been our european distributor of muse since the assets sold in the muse transaction include the us and foreign muse patents  existing inventory  and the manufacturing facility located in lakewood  new jersey 
we retained all of the liabilities associated with the pre closing operations and products of the muse business and the accounts receivables for pre closing muse sales 
the transaction closed on november  the sale of muse will allow us to focus on the approval and commercialization of qnexa and the development of avanafil 
prior to the closing of the muse transaction  we regained all of the rights to muse and avanafil held by deerfield management company  lp  and affiliates  and crown bank  na  or crown 
on october   in preparation for the closing of the muse transaction and in accordance with the terms of the agreements with crown  we paid million to crown in satisfaction of all obligations owed to them under these agreements 
as a result  the security interests and certificate of deposit held by crown were terminated in our favor 
under the terms of the muse transaction  we received an upfront payment of million upon the closing and are eligible to receive an additional million based on future sales of muse  provided that certain sales milestones are reached 
upon the closing of the muse transaction  meda is now responsible for the manufacturing  selling and marketing of muse 
meda also assumed all post closing expenses and liabilities associated with muse 
we have agreed not to develop  manufacture or sell any transurethral erectile dysfunction drugs for a period of three years following the closing of the muse transaction 
the assets and liabilities and results of operations associated with muse have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented

these payments satisfied all of the financial obligations under the fara and opa 
as a result  all of the outstanding shares and the million of cash of the deerfield sub are owned by us  all of the outstanding loans owed by the deerfield sub have been repaid and the security interests in the collateral related to muse and avanafil held by the deerfield sub and the deerfield affiliates as part of the fara and opa were terminated 
the payoff of the deerfield loan resulted in a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of million which was recognized in the fourth quarter of in december  the deerfield sub was dissolved

there are likely to be additional research and development expenses related to avanafil and qnexa and our other investigational drug candidates under development 
our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical and pre clinical studies 
regardless  if we are successful in obtaining fda regulatory approval for any new investigational drug candidates being developed through our research and development efforts  except for qnexa and avanafil  currently under fda regulatory review  we do not expect to recognize revenue from sales of such new drugs  if any  for at least a year or more due to the length of time required to develop investigational drug candidates into commercially viable products 
research and development expenses in the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million in the same period last year 
this decrease was the net result of decreased spending for qnexa for obesity of million  decreased spending for avanafil of million and a net decrease in other research and development spending of  partially offset by million in increased spending related to the filing of the marketing authorization application for qnexa in the european union in the year ended december   as compared to the same period last year

the funding necessary to execute our business strategies is subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials and approval by the fda may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of an investigational drug candidate 
it is also important to note that if an investigational drug candidate is identified  the further development of that candidate can be halted or abandoned at any time due to a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  funding constraints  lack of efficacy or safety or change in market demand 
the nature and efforts required to develop our investigational drug candidates into commercially viable drugs include research to identify a clinical candidate  pre clinical development  clinical testing  fda approval and commercialization 
this process is very costly and can take in excess of years to complete for each investigational drug candidate 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of matters arising during the clinical studies  including  among others  the following we or the fda may suspend trials  we may discover that an investigational drug candidate may cause harmful side effects or is not effective  patient recruitment may be slower than expected  and patients may drop out of the trials 
for each of our investigational drug candidate development programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and the merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs were terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
as such  the ultimate timeline and costs to commercialize a drug cannot be accurately estimated 
our investigational drug candidates have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish substantial evidence of safety and efficacy 
the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later clinical trials 
it is possible for a candidate to show promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 

table of contents as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion of our investigational drug candidate development programs are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and investigational drug candidate development programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
we may also be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other areas of our business 
in particular  our future capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon or be impacted by numerous factors  including the cost  timing and final outcome of fortress  the fda s interpretation of the data we submitted and may submit relating to teratogenicity and cardiovascular safety  the fda s interpretation of the data from our sequel study ob and sleep apnea study ob  whether or not the fda or ema requires us to perform additional studies for qnexa  whether or not the fda requires us to perform additional studies for avanafil  the outcome of an advisory committee meeting to review the resubmission of the qnexa nda  the cost and time required to set up a distribution system and rems program for qnexa that is suitable to address any fda concerns  our response to the ema s requests for information included in the day loi for qnexa  whether or not the fda approves the nda for avanafil  our ability to successfully commercialize by establishing marketing partnerships for avanafil  if approved  in the us and worldwide  mtpc s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval to manufacture and adequately supply avanafil for commercial use  the progress and costs of our research and development programs  the scope  timing and results of pre clinical  clinical and retrospective observational studies and trials  the cost of access to electronic records and databases that allow for retrospective observational studies  patient recruitment and enrollment in planned and future clinical trials  the costs involved in seeking regulatory approvals for our investigational drug candidates  the costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications and enforcing patent claims  the establishment of collaborations  sublicenses and strategic alliances and the related costs  including milestone payments  the costs involved in establishing a commercial operation and in launching a product without a partner  the cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities and arrangements  
table of contents the results of operations  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the rate of technological advances  ongoing determinations of the potential commercial success of our investigational drug candidates under development  the state of the economy and financing environment  the regulatory approval environment and regulatory hurdles for safety assessment for new products  the cost  timing and outcome of litigations  the healthcare reimbursement system or the impact of healthcare reform  if any  imposed by the us federal government  the level of resources devoted to sales and marketing capabilities  perceptions and interpretations of qnexa or the data by outside analysts or others  and the activities of competitors 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources combined with anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating needs at least through however  we anticipate that we may require additional funding to launch qnexa  if approved  to continue our research and investigational drug candidate development programs  to conduct pre clinical  clinical and retrospective studies and trials  to fund operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our investigational drug candidates  to finance the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending our patent claims  if any  and we may require additional funding to establish additional or new manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the future and to manufacture quantities of our investigational drug candidates for approval and commercialization 
in particular  we expect to make other substantial payments to the inventor of qnexa pending approval by the fda and to mtpc  in accordance with our agreements with mtpc in connection with the licensing of avanafil 
these payments are based on certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  we are required to make royalty payments on any future product sales 
similar to the transaction with evamist  we may consider selling or licensing any of our investigational drug candidates in development in order to raise additional funding 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets at any time 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances  acquisitions of companies with cash balances and other financing mechanisms 
we cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our investigational drug candidate development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others 
this may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or investigational drug candidates and to pay royalties on future product sales 
to the extent that we are unable to obtain third party funding for such expenses  we expect that increased expenses may result in future losses from operations 
we are continually evaluating our existing portfolio and we may choose to divest or sell one or more of our investigational drug candidates at any time 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop our products under development or that our products  if approved for sale  will generate revenues sufficient to enable us to earn a profit

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
market and interest rate risk our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds and us treasury securities 
our cash is invested in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors that specifies the categories money market funds  us treasury securities and debt securities of us government agencies  corporate bonds  asset backed securities  and other securities  allocations  and ratings of securities we may consider for investment 
currently  we have focused on investing in us treasuries until market conditions improve 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a 
table of contents change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment may decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by approximately  in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
there is ongoing concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed  asset backed and auction rate securities and the resultant effect on various securities markets 
in addition  continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession and fears of a possible depression 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary and may cause stock price volatility 
our investment policy  as approved by our board of directors  allows us to invest in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities that are not federally insured 
given the current economic instability  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these investments
