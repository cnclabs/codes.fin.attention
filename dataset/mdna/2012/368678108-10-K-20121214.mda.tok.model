overview gencor industries  inc  the company is a leading manufacturer of heavy machinery used in the production of highway construction materials  synthetic fuels  and environmental control equipment 
the company s core products include asphalt plants  combustion systems and fluid heat transfer systems 
the company s products are manufactured in two facilities in the united states 
because the company s products are sold primarily to the highway construction industry  the business is seasonal in nature 
traditionally  the company s customers do not purchase new equipment for shipment during the summer and fall months to avoid disrupting their peak season for highway construction and repair work 
the majority of orders for the company s products are thus received between october and february  with a significant volume of shipments occurring prior to june 
the principal factors driving demand for the company s products are the overall economic conditions  the level of government funding for domestic highway construction and repair  infrastructure development in emerging economies  the need for spare parts  fluctuations in the price of crude oil liquid asphalt as well as fuel costs  and a trend towards larger plants resulting from industry consolidation 
in august  the federal government passed the safe  accountable  flexible and efficient transportation equity act a legacy for users safetea lu 
this bill appropriated a multi year guaranteed funding of billion for federal highway  transit and safety programs that expired on september  on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  which included approximately billion for highway and bridge construction activities 
the arra and any future legislation approved by congress could reduce infrastructure funding levels 
in addition  funding restrictions can be imposed on states that do not comply with certain federal policies 
on march   president obama signed into law the hiring incentives to restore employment hire act 
this law extended authorization of the surface transportation programs previously funded under safetea lu through december  at levels 
in addition  the hire act authorized a one time transfer of billion from the general fund to the highway trust fund related to previously foregone interest payments 
on december   president obama signed into law the continuing appropriations and surface transportation extensions act  extending funding for federal surface transportation programs authorized under safetea lu through march  on march   president obama signed into law the surface transportation extension act of providing an extension of federal aid highway  transit and other programs funded out of the highway trust fund through september  on september   president obama signed an eighth extension of safetea lu  authorizing funding at levels through march   and on march   the president signed into law the surface transportation extension act of  a day extension of the existing federal transportation reauthorization 
the bill contained no policy changes and extended current programs and funding levels through june   pending enactment of a multi year law reauthorizing such programs 

table of contents on july   president obama signed a billion transportation bill  moving ahead for progress in the st century act map 
map includes a final three month extension of safetea lu at current spending levels combined with a new two year  billion authorization of the federal highway  transit  and safety programs effective october  the new bill will provide states and communities with two years of steady funding needed to build roads  bridges  and transit systems 
the company believes this will have a modest impact on the road construction industry and will allow its customers to plan and execute longer term projects 
in addition  the canadian government enacted major infrastructure stimulus programs which have benefitted the company 
in  the building canada plan provided billion in infrastructure funding through as part of the building canada plan  the gas tax fund was approved in  providing billion in annual infrastructure spending 
the infrastructure canada plan provided billion additional infrastructure funding from through the economic downturn over the past several years and the lack of a multi year federal highway bill have resulted in reduced purchasing within the company s served markets 
this had an adverse impact on sales and pricing pressures on the company s products  resulting in lower revenues and margins 
in addition to government funding and the overall economic conditions  fluctuations in the price of oil  which is a major component of asphalt mix  may affect the company s financial performance 
an increase in the price of oil increases the cost of liquid asphalt and could  therefore  decrease demand for asphalt and certain of the company s products 
increases in oil prices also drive up the cost of gasoline  which results in increased freight costs 
where possible  the company will pass increased freight costs on to its customers 
however  the company may not be able to recapture all of the increased costs and thus could have a negative impact on the company s financial performance 
steel is a major component used in manufacturing the company s equipment 
fluctuations in the price of steel can have a significant impact on the company s financial results 
where possible  the company will pass on increased steel costs to its customers 
however  the company may not be able to recapture all of the increased steel costs and thus its financial results could be negatively affected 
for the long term  the company believes its strategy of continuing to invest in product engineering and development and its focus on delivering high quality products and superior service will strengthen the company s market position when demand for its products rebound 
in response to the short term outlook  the company has taken actions to conserve cash  right size its operations and cost structure 
these actions included adjustments to workforce  reduced purchases of raw materials and reductions in administrative expenses 
the company continues to review its internal processes to identify inefficiencies and cost reductions and will continue reviewing its relationships with suppliers to ensure the company is achieving the highest quality products and services at the most competitive prices
