overview the company develops  manufactures and sells marine seismic data acquisition equipment and underwater remotely operated robotic vehicles 
the company s four operating units  each of which is considered to be a separate reportable segment  consist of seismic energy sources  underwater cables and connectors  seismic energy source controllers and underwater robotic vehicles 
refer to note to consolidated financial statements for further information on reportable segments 
sales of the company s products in the three segments dedicated to marine seismic data acquisition equipment seismic energy sources  underwater cables and connectors and seismic energy source controllers are generally related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and development activity  which is typically based on current and projected crude oil and natural gas prices 
sales of the company s underwater robotic vehicles are generally related to the demand from government and quasi government units 
during the past three fiscal years  the combined sales for the marine seismic data acquisition segments have improved from  in fiscal year  to  in fiscal year  and to  in fiscal year these improved sales levels reflect higher marine seismic exploration activity in fiscal years and the company is hopeful that the improvement in sales in the marine seismic data acquisition segments will continue in fiscal year based on customer orders and inquiries 
in addition  rts s smart energy source  a digital gun controller that also provides sophisticated near field measurements  is planned for market introduction in fiscal year the outlook for these segments remains strong based on the continuing necessity to discover offshore hydrocarbon reserves as reserves in existing fields are depleted 
there can be no assurance  however  that improved sales and earnings will continue next year due to the marine seismic industry s dependency on crude oil and gas prices  as well as the continuing global economic and political uncertainty 
effective january   the company acquired seabotix inc  a developer  manufacturer and seller of underwater remotely operated robotic vehicles 
sbx s sales for the company s fiscal year amounted to  representing only six months of activity due to the january  acquisition date 
in fiscal year  sbx s sales increased to  reflecting its successful introduction of new products  the easing of budgetary constraints previously experienced by its major customer groups  including the us defense budget  and federal  state and local governmental units  overall improvement in economic conditions and the inclusion of the full twelve months of sbx activity 
however  sbx s sales growth remains dependent on higher demand from its major customer groups  fluctuations in government budget levels and continued competitive success in the marketplace 
refer to notes  and to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning sbx 
the company had an accrued estimated contingent earnout liability to the former sbx stockholders at june  of  an earnout payment in the amount of  was made in february  reducing the balance of the accrual to  at march  based on sbx s increased sales in fiscal year  and anticipated sbx sales over the remaining earnout period ending on december   the company increased the estimated contingent earnout liability from  at march  to  at june  the  increase to the contingent earnout liability was charged to the consolidated statement of income in fiscal year this adjustment is a non cash item and is also a nondeductible expense for income tax purposes 
including this earnout adjustment  the company s basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year was 
excluding the earnout adjustment  the company s basic and diluted earnings per share would have been 
although the  adjustment was a substantial charge to operating results in fiscal year  it is also an indicator that estimated sales and earnings for sbx over the earnout period ending december  are anticipated to be substantially higher than at acquisition 
the company announced in september that it had commenced joint development efforts with westerngeco  a product line group of schlumberger limited  to develop an environmentally sensitive energy source for marine seismic exploration surveys 
the air gun is a bandwidth controlled source of acoustic waves designed to reduce the potential impact of seismic signals on marine life 
this is a multi phase project which  if successfully developed and commercialized  could be a significant new development in the marine seismic exploration industry 
expenditures made in support of this project were charged to research and development expense in the consolidated statement of income 
at the board s november meeting  the board of directors declared a special dividend of per share on its outstanding common stock 
this special cash dividend  in the aggregate amount of  was paid on december  to stockholders of record on december  in january  the board authorized and approved the institution of a quarterly dividend program  with dividends payable in january  april  july and october

refer to liquidity and capital resources for further information on the company s stock repurchase program 
the company remained debt free at june  the company follows accounting standards set by the financial accounting standards board fasb  which are referred to as generally accepted accounting principles or gaap  as contained in the fasb accounting standards codification 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company believes that current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet foreseeable operating needs for fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company s board of directors authorized and approved a program to repurchase up to  of its common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions 
pursuant to the terms of the repurchase program  management determines the timing and amount of any stock repurchase transactions depending on market conditions  share prices  capital availability and other factors 
the company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the repurchase program 
the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
the repurchase program is structured to conform to the safe harbor provisions of sec rule b as of june   the company had repurchased  of its shares under the repurchase program at an aggregate cost of  the sec declared the company s shelf registration statement on form s  relating to the sale of up to  of equity  debt or other types of securities described in the shelf registration statement  effective on january  the proceeds of the sale of such securities may be used for acquisitions  capital expenditures  repayment of debt the company may incur in the future  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the specifics of any potential future offering  along with the prices  terms and use of proceeds of any securities offered by the company  will be determined at the time of any applicable offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement at the time of such applicable offering 
the company has no current plans to offer securities under the shelf registration statement 
fiscal year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount is  or lower than the amount of cash and cash equivalents at june  the decrease was due primarily to the company s payment of consideration relating to the acquisition of sbx  dividend payments and stock repurchase program 
for the fiscal year ended june   cash flow provided from operating activities after changes in working capital items was  primarily due to net income adjusted for non cash items and higher current liabilities  excluding acquisition related liabilities  partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory 
for the fiscal year ended june   cash used in investing activities was  due to the payment of consideration relating to the acquisition of sbx  capital expenditures for new and replacement equipment  and other non current assets for the fiscal year ended june   cash used in financing activities was  primarily due to dividends paid to stockholders  and the repurchases of the company s common stock  offset by the cash received from the exercise of stock options 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal year will not exceed  which will be funded from operating cash flow 
these anticipated capital expenditures will relate primarily to new production machinery and equipment 
since a relatively small number of customers account for the majority of the company s sales  the consolidated accounts receivable balance at the end of any period tends to be concentrated in a small number of customers 
at june  and june   the five customers with the highest accounts receivable balances represented and of the consolidated accounts receivable balances on those dates  respectively 
the decrease in concentration is due to higher sbx accounts receivable balances at june  fiscal year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount is  or lower than the amount of cash and cash equivalents at june  the decrease was due primarily to the company s acquisition of sbx and its stock repurchase program 
for the fiscal year ended june   cash flow provided from operating activities after changes in working capital items was  primarily due to net income adjusted for non cash items  partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory and lower current liabilities  excluding acquisition related liabilities 
for the fiscal year ended june   cash used in investing activities was  due to the payment of consideration relating to the acquisition of sbx  capital expenditures for new and replacement equipment  and other non current assets for the fiscal year ended june   cash used in financing activities was  primarily due to repurchases of the company s common stock  and sbx debt repayment

results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended june  totaled  an increase of  or from the fiscal year ended june  the change in sales by reportable segment was as follows seismic energy sources increased by   underwater cables and connectors increased by   seismic energy source controllers decreased by  and underwater robotic vehicles increased by  
higher sales in the seismic energy sources segment was due primarily to increased air gun replacement business 
lower sales in the seismic energy source controllers segment reflects decreasing demand for analog controllers in favor of digital controllers 
a digital controller  the smart energy source  has been developed  and is in final field testing 
commercial marketing of the smart energy source digital controller is anticipated to commence in fiscal year sbx s sales in fiscal year were  representing six months of activity due to the january  acquisition date 
sbx s sales in fiscal year were  reflecting sbx s successful introduction of new products  easing of governmental budget constraints  several large orders from the us department of defense  and twelve months of activity 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales was for the fiscal year ended june  versus for the fiscal year ended june  the net decrease in the gross profit percentage was primarily due to sbx reflecting higher indirect manufacturing costs and distributor discounts 
research and development r d costs for the fiscal year ended june  increased by  or from the fiscal year ended june  the increase was due to the company entered a joint development effort with westerngeco in september to develop an environmentally sensitive energy source for marine seismic exploration surveys and incurred  in expense for this project in fiscal year r d costs for sbx increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year since only six months were included in fiscal year due to the january  acquisition date  as well as higher engineering costs for sbx in fiscal year selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  or in the fiscal year ended june  from the fiscal year ended june  sg a for the fiscal years ended june  and includes sbx in the amount of  and  respectively 
in fiscal year  sg a of sbx was only for a six month period due to the january  acquisition date 
in addition  sbx sg a in fiscal year includes higher advertising and trade show and commission expenses 
excluding sbx  sg a increased by  or primarily due to higher compensation expense 
the company recorded an adjustment of contingent earnout liability of  with respect to potential future earnout payments to former sbx stockholders in the fiscal year ended june  this non cash charge to the results of operations is also a nondeductible expense for income tax purposes 
this liability is evaluated each reporting period and any changes to the earnout liability is recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the adjustment to the contingent earnout liability is based on management s assessment of the likelihood of achievement of certain revenue levels during the earnout period ending december  refer to notes and to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning sbx 
the company conducted an annual impairment test of the a g and rts goodwill balances  and the results of these tests indicated that there was no impairment of the june  and goodwill balances 
the company conducted an annual impairment test of the sbx goodwill balance at december  and the results of this test indicated that there was no impairment 
intangible assets with indefinite lives must be tested annually  or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment  to determine if events and circumstances still justify the carrying value of such asset 
the sbx intangible asset with an indefinite life was tested for impairment at december  and the test indicated no impairment 
the company reviewed intangible assets with indefinite lives at june  and such review did not result in any indicators of impairment  and therefore no impairment tests were performed 
the company also reviewed other long lived assets  including intangible assets with definite lives  for indicators of impairment 
the company s reviews at june  and june  did not result in any indicators of impairment  and therefore no impairment tests were performed 
interest income decreased by  or in the fiscal year ended june  from the fiscal year ended june   primarily due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances

sales for sbx  which was acquired effective january   were  for the six month period ended june  the increase in net sales reflects an increase in marine seismic exploration activity  and the acquisition of sbx 
the improvement in sales of seismic energy sources and underwater cables and connectors reflects the outfitting of several new seismic vessels with the company s equipment 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales was for the fiscal year ended june  versus for the fiscal year ended june  the net decrease in the gross profit percentage was caused primarily by sales mix  partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales increase for the three marine seismic data acquisition segments in aggregate 
research and development r d costs for the fiscal year ended june  increased by  or from the fiscal year ended june  the increase was due to sbx r d relating to the development of new and refinement of existing underwater robotic vehicle products 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased by  or in the fiscal year ended june  from the fiscal year ended june  sg a for the fiscal year ended june  includes sbx  and sbx acquisition costs 
excluding sbx and related acquisition costs  sg a increased by  or  primarily due to higher compensation expenses  partially offset by lower bad debt expense 
the company conducted an annual impairment test of the a g and rts goodwill balances  and the results of these tests indicated that there was no impairment of the june  and goodwill balances 
the company conducted the initial annual impairment test of the sbx goodwill balance at december  the company also reviewed other long lived assets  including other intangible assets  for indicators of impairment 
the company reviews at june  and june  did not result in any indicators of impairment  and therefore no impairment tests were performed 
interest income decreased by  or in the fiscal year ended june  from the fiscal year ended june   primarily due to lower interest rates  cash used to acquire sbx and purchases of treasury stock  partially offset by increases in the company s cash and cash equivalent balances during the first six months of fiscal year the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended june  was  an effective tax rate of

the above mentioned factors resulted in net income for the fiscal year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the fiscal year ended june  critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying the accounting policies most critical to its financial statements have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  the company s most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  recording of inventory reserves  valuation of acquisitions  contingent earnout liability  deferred taxes  and the potential impairment of goodwill  intangible assets with indefinite lives and other long lived assets 
these policies are discussed below 
the company also has other key accounting policies  including the establishment of bad debt reserves 
the company believes that these other policies either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or are less likely to have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
although the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the end of each reporting period and involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the company s estimates and its estimates could be different using different assumptions or conditions 
refer to note to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales revenue when it is realized and earned 
the company s reported sales revenue is based on meeting the following criteria manufacturing products based on customer specifications  establishing a set sales price with the customer  delivering product to the customer before the close of the reporting period  whereby delivery results in the transfer of ownership risk to the customer  collecting of the sales revenue from the customer is reasonably assured  and no contingencies exist 
inventory reserves a significant source of the company s revenue arises from the sale of replacement parts required by customers who have previously purchased products 
as a result  the company maintains a large quantity of parts on hand that may not be sold or used in final assemblies for an extended period of time 
in order to recognize that certain inventory may become obsolete or that the company may have supplies in excess of reasonably supportable sales forecasts  an inventory valuation reserve has been established 
the inventory valuation reserve is a significant estimate made by management based on experience and the exercise of professional judgment 
actual results may differ from this estimate  and the difference could be material 
management establishes the inventory valuation reserve by reviewing the inventory for items that should be reserved in full based on a lack of usage for a specified period of time and for which future demand is not forecasted and establishes an additional reserve for slow moving inventory based on varying percentages of the cost of the items 
the inventory valuation reserve at june  and june  was  and  respectively 
at june  and june   approximately  and  respectively  of the raw materials and sub assemblies inventory were considered slow moving and subject to a reserve provision equal to all or a portion of the cost 
in certain instances  this inventory has been unsold for more than five years from the date of manufacture or purchase  and in other instances the company has more than a five year supply of inventory on hand based on recent sales volume 
management believes that this inventory is properly valued and appropriately reserved 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  that would not result in a cash outlay since the cash required to manufacture or purchase the older inventory was expended in prior years 
the inventory valuation reserve is adjusted at the close of each accounting period  as necessary  based on management s estimate of the inventory valuation reserve required 
this estimate is calculated on a consistent basis as determined by the company s inventory valuation policy 
increases to the inventory valuation reserve result in a charge to cost of sales  and decreases to the reserve result in a credit to cost of sales 
the inventory valuation reserve is also decreased when items are scrapped or disposed 
during the fiscal year ended june   the inventory valuation reserve decreased by a net amount of  reflecting an increase in the inventory valuation reserve in the amount of  and a decrease due to scrapped inventory in the amount of  valuation of acquisitions the company allocates the amounts it pays for each acquisition to the assets it acquires and the liabilities it assumes  based on estimated fair values at acquisition date 
the company determines the estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets based on valuations that use historical information and market assumptions 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill 
the use of different valuation assumptions  including estimated cash flows and discount rates  or different estimated useful life assumptions  could result in different purchase price allocations and intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods 
contingent earnout liability in the sbx acquisition  the company is obligated under an earnout arrangement to make cash payments to the former sbx stockholders if certain revenue targets are achieved 
the company recorded a contingent earnout liability at the acquisition date at its estimated fair value  which takes into account the range and probability of projected future revenues of the acquired entity over the earnout period 
the company revalues the contingent earnout liability at the close of each accounting period and records any change in the estimated fair value in the consolidated statement of income as adjustment of contingent earnout liability 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the sbx contingent earnout liability can result from changes in assumed revenues  probabilities of achieving revenue targets and discount rates 
significant judgment is used in determining the appropriateness of fair value assumptions at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
as a result  actual contingent earnout payments can differ from estimates  and the differences could be material 
the company had an accrued estimated contingent earnout liability to the former sbx stockholders at june  of  an earnout payment in the amount of  was made in february  reducing the balance of the accrual to  at march  based on sbx s increased sales in fiscal year  and anticipated sbx sales over the remaining earnout period ending on december   the company increased the estimated contingent earnout liability from  at march  to  at june  the  increase to the contingent earnout liability was charged to the consolidated statement of income in fiscal year this adjustment is a non cash item and is also a nondeductible expense for income tax purposes 
including this earnout adjustment  the company s basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year was 
excluding the earnout adjustment  the company s basic and diluted earnings per share would have been 
although the  adjustment to earnout liability was a substantial charge to operating results for fiscal year  it is also an indicator that estimated sales and earnings for sbx over the earnout period ending december  are anticipated to be substantially greater than at acquisition 
deferred taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
the company reviews its internal forecasted sales and pre tax earnings estimates to make its assessment about the utilization of deferred tax assets 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
if that assessment were to change  a charge or a benefit would be recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the company has concluded that no deferred tax valuation allowance was necessary at june  and june  because future taxable income is believed to be sufficient to utilize any deferred tax asset 
impairment testing of goodwill  intangible assets with indefinite lives and other long lived assets the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
a g and rts goodwill was tested for impairment and the tests indicated no impairment of the goodwill balances at june  and june  sbx goodwill was initially tested for impairment at december  and the test indicated no impairment of the goodwill balance 
goodwill represents approximately of the company s total assets at june  the evaluation of goodwill is thus a significant estimate by management 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  it would not result in a cash outlay because the goodwill amounts arose out of acquisition accounting 
refer to notes  and to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning goodwill 
intangible assets with indefinite lives must be tested annually  or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment  to determine if events and circumstances still justify the carrying value of such asset 
the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value 
any such loss would be recognized in the period in which the impairment arose 
the sbx intangible asset with an indefinite life was tested for impairment at december  and the test indicated no impairment 
the company reviewed intangible assets with indefinite lives at june  and june  and such reviews did not result in any indicators of impairment 
the company s other long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment  other intangible assets with definite lives and other non current assets 
the company reviews for the impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount is considered impaired when anticipated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
any such impairment is measured based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset and would be recognized in the company s results of operations in the period in which the impairment loss arose 
the company s reviews as of june  and june  did not result in any indicators of impairment  and therefore no impairment tests were performed 
recent accounting developments fair value measurement in may  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss 
the purpose of asu  which amends the guidance to topic fair value measurements and disclosures  is to provide common requirements for measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements presented in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and ifrss 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have an impact on the company s financial statements but requires additional disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
testing goodwill for impairment in september  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
the purpose of asu  which amends the guidance to topic  intangibles goodwill and other  is to simplify how entities test for goodwill impairment  and to reduce costs 
asu allows an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
the amendments in asu permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if events or circumstances exist leading to a determination that it is more likely than not more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  an entity must perform a more detailed  two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential impairment and measure any goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
asu also improves previous guidance by providing examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests to determine if there is impairment 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu will not have an impact on the company s financial statements because it is intended to simplify the process for conducting the goodwill impairment assessment 
the company adopted asu at june  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in july  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the purpose of asu  which amends the guidance to topic  intangibles goodwill and other  is to simplify the guidance for testing the decline in the realizable value impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
asu allows an entity to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets is necessary  similar in approach to the goodwill impairment test 
the amendments in asu permit an entity to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not more than that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  thus necessitating that it perform the quantitative impairment test 
an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  and early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements
