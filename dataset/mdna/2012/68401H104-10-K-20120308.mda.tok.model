item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and other parts of this report may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a global biopharmaceutical company currently focused on commercializing our antibiotic product dificid fidaxomicin in the united states  and further developing other fixacomicin products in the united states and worldwide  both ourselves and with our partners and licensees 
dificid is indicated for the treatment of cdad in adults years of age or older  and is the first antibacterial drug to be approved in the united states for the treatment of cdad in nearly years 
we are currently marketing dificid in the united states through our own sales force and through our co promotion agreement with cubist pharmaceuticals  inc  or cubist 
in addition  in december  the european medicines agency  or ema  approved the marketing authorization application  or maa  for dificlir fidaxomicin tablets for the treatment of adults suffering with cdad in europe 
in february  we entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with astellas to develop and commercialize fidaxomicin in europe  africa and certain other countries in the middle east and cis which we refer to as the astellas territory 
in return for an exclusive license to fidaxomicin in the astellas territory  astellas paid to us an upfront cash payment of million and we are eligible to receive additional cash payments totaling up to million euros upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones 
of this amount  million euros will become due days after the earlier to occur of launch in two major countries or six months after ema approval of the maa for dificlir and million euros will become due days after the launch of a fidaxomicin product in any country in the astellas territory 
furthermore  we will be entitled to receive escalating double digit royalties ranging from the high teens to low twenties on net sales of fidaxomicin in the astellas territory 
astellas is responsible for all future costs associated with the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of fidaxomicin in the astellas territory 
in connection with the collaboration and license agreement  we also entered into a supply agreement with astellas pursuant to which we will be the exclusive supplier of dificid to astellas in the astellas territory and astellas is obligated to pay us an amount equal to cost plus an agreed mark up for such supply 
in  we established a commercial infrastructure to implement the commercialization of dificid in the us in addition  as part of our dificid launch strategy  in april  we entered into a co promotion agreement with cubist pursuant to which we engaged cubist as our exclusive partner for the promotion of dificid in the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  we and cubist have agreed to co promote dificid to physicians  hospitals  long term care facilities and other healthcare institutions as well as jointly provide medical affairs support for dificid 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be responsible for the distribution of dificid in the united states and for recording revenue from sales of dificid  and we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain adequate inventory and third party logistics support for the supply of dificid in the united states 
the initial term of the agreement is two years from the date of first commercial sale of dificid in the united states  subject to renewal or early termination 
in exchange for cubist s co promotion activities and personnel commitments  we are obligated to pay a quarterly fee of approximately million to cubist million per year upon the commencement of the dificid sales program in the united states 
cubist is also eligible to receive an additional million in the first year after first commercial sale and million in the second year if mutually agreed upon annual sales targets are achieved  as well as a portion of our gross profits derived from net sales above the specified annual targets  if any 
we currently have made the decision to exit basic research 
however in the future we may develop additional product candidates using our proprietary technology  including our opops drug discovery platform 
opops is a computer aided technology that allows the development of potential drug candidates through carbohydrate mediated medicinal chemistry and enables the rapid synthesis of a wide variety of proprietary molecules 
it includes glycooptimization  which enables the modification of a carbohydrate group on an existing drug to improve its properties  and de novo glycosylation  which introduces new carbohydrate groups on existing drugs to create new patentable compounds with improvement of pharmacokinetics 
we were incorporated in november since inception  we have focused on developing and commercializing dificid and other fidaxomicin products 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  including the costs of clinical trial activities  license fees and general and administrative expenses  and more recently expenses incurred in connection with our commercial efforts with respect to dificid in the united states 
we expect to incur operating losses for the next several years as we pursue the commercialization of dificid  as well as further development of 
table of contents dificid  including conducting post marketing studies for label expansion and to obtain approval in the us for use of dificid for a prophylaxis indication  and further development  regulatory approval and commercialization of fidaxomicin worldwide 
we may also acquire or in license additional products or product candidates  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 
financial operations overview revenues our revenues depend on our ability to successfully commercialize dificid 
we began commercial sale of dificid in july and have begun to generate revenue on such sales 
we sell dificid to three major wholesalers  amerisourcebergen corporation  cardinal health  inc  and mckesson corporation  and regional wholesalers that provide the dificid to hospital and retail pharmacies  and long term care facilities 
prior to our launch of dificid in july  we have generated revenues primarily as a result of various collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and grants from government agencies 
revenues from license and collaboration agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the underlying agreements 
revenue is deferred for fees received before they are earned 
nonrefundable upfront payments and license fees  where we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligation  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the contract or development period 
milestone payments are generally recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the milestones as specified in the underlying agreement  assuming we meet certain criteria 
royalty revenues from the sale of dificid are recognized upon the sale of such products 
cost and expenses cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of royalty fees paid related to net sales of dificid 
a significant portion of the cost of dificid sold during the year was expensed as research and development expenses when manufactured in the beginning of the year since dificid had not been approved by the fda at that time 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with identifying and developing our drug candidates and developing and advancing our drug discovery technology 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with clinical trials managed by our cros and costs associated with non clinical research activities and regulatory approvals 
our historical research and development expenses have resulted predominantly from our clinical trials of dificid  the development of our carbohydrate technology platforms  including opops  in licensing fees and general research activities 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred because the underlying technology associated with these expenditures relates to our research and development efforts and has no alternative future uses 
from inception through december   we incurred total research and development expenses of approximately million 
we use our internal research and development resources across several projects  and much of this use is not allocable to a specific project 
accordingly  we do not account for all of our internal research and development costs on a project basis 
in addition to our internal resources  we use external service providers and vendors to conduct our clinical trials  to manufacture our product candidates to be used in clinical trials and to provide various other research and development related products and services 
these external costs are allocable to specific projects 
we incurred million  million and million of research and development expenses directly related to the development of dificid for the years ended december  and  and cumulatively through december   respectively 
all other research and development expenses were for other clinical programs 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation  including stock based compensation  related to our corporate operations and administrative employees  co promotion costs relating to cubist  and other expenses related to an allocated portion of facility cost  legal fees and other professional services expenses  and insurance costs 
we anticipate that the level of selling  general and administrative expenditures will increase as we increase our commercial infrastructure globally 
interest income expense and other  net 
interest income expense and other  net consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and other than temporary declines in the market value of available for sale securities and cash and non cash interest charges related to bridge financings 

table of contents net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
as of december  we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in for federal purposes and for state purposes 
the foreign losses will begin expiring in as of december   we had both federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal tax credits will begin expiring in unless previously utilized and the state tax credits carryforward indefinitely 
as of december   we had a state manufacturer s investment tax credit carryforward of approximately  which will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits before they expire 
as of december   we have completed a section analysis regarding the limitation of the net operating losses and credit carryovers and determined that the entire amount of us federal and state net operating losses and credit carryovers are available for utilization  subject to the annual limitation 
any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of future limitation will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
due to the existence of the valuation allowance  future changes in the unrecognized tax benefits will not impact the effective tax rate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined in a manner which approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
we capitalize inventory produced in preparation for product launches upon fda approval when costs are expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product 
we reserve for potentially excess  dated or obsolete inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand compared to forecasts of future sales 
as of december   inventories consist of million in raw materials  million in work in progress and  in finished goods 
revenue recognition dificid is available only through three major wholesalers  amerisourcebergen corporation  cardinal health  inc  and mckesson corporation  and regional wholesalers that provide the dificid to hospital and retail pharmacies  and long term care facilities 
we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  title has passed to the customer  the price is fixed and determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay us  the obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer has economic substance apart from us  we have no obligation to bring about the sale of the product  the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize product sales of dificid upon delivery of product to the wholesalers 
during the year ended december   the million in net product revenue to wholesalers reflected a total of  dificid treatments 
 dificid treatments were shipped to hospitals  retail pharmacies and long term care facilities 
as of december    hospitals had ordered dificid with hospitals covered by the company and cubist have placed dificid on their formularies 

table of contents our net revenues represent total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated rebates  discounts and returns 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate based on available information and will be adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such allowances 
allowances for rebates  discounts and returns are established based on the contractual terms with customers  communications with customers as well as expectations about the market for the product and anticipated introduction of competitive products 
product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
product sales allowances 
we establish reserves for prompt payment discounts and distribution fee for service arrangements with our contracted wholesalers  government rebates  product returns and other applicable allowances 
reserves established for these discounts and allowances are classified as a reduction of accounts receivable 
allowances against receivable balances primarily relate to prompt payment discounts and are recorded at the time of sale  resulting in a reduction in product sales revenue 
accruals related to government rebates  product returns and other applicable allowances are recognized at the time of sale  resulting in a reduction in product sales revenue and the recording of an increase in accrued expenses 
prompt payment discounts 
we offer a prompt payment discount to our contracted wholesalers 
since we expect our customers will take advantage of this discount  we accrue of the prompt payment discount that is based on the gross amount of each invoice  at the time of sale 
the accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect actual earned discounts 
government rebates and chargebacks 
we estimate government mandated rebates and discounts relating to federal and state programs such as medicaid  veterans administration  or va  and department of defense programs  the medicare part d coverage discount program  as well as with respect to certain other qualifying federal and state government programs 
we estimate the amount of these reductions based on historical trends for similar competitive products  until such time as dificid patient data  actual sales data and market research data related to payor mix has reached an established steady state 
these allowances are adjusted each period based on actual experience 
medicaid rebate reserves relate to our estimated obligations to states under statutory best price obligations which may also include supplemental rebate agreements with certain states 
rebate accruals are recorded during the same period in which the related product sales are recognized 
actual rebate amounts are determined at the time of claim by the state  and we will generally make cash payments for such amounts after receiving billings from the state 
va rebates or chargeback reserves represent our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell dificid to qualified healthcare providers at a price lower than the list price charged to our distributor 
the distributor will charge us for the difference between what the distributor pays for the product and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare provider 
rebate accruals are established during the same period in which the related product sales are recognized 
actual chargeback amounts for public health service are determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider from the distributor  and we will generally issue credits for such amounts after receiving notification from the distributor 
although allowances and accruals are recorded at the time of product sale  certain rebates will be generally paid out  on average  up to six months or longer after the sale 
reserve estimates are evaluated quarterly and  if necessary  adjusted to reflect actual results 
any such adjustments will be reflected in our operating results in the period of the adjustment 
product returns 
our policy is to accept returns of dificid for six months prior to and twelve months after the product expiration date 
we also permit returns if the product is damaged or defective when received by its customers 
we will provide a credit for such returns to customers with whom we have a direct relationship 
once product is dispensed it cannot be returned  but we allow partial returns in states where such returns are mandated 
we do not exchange product from inventory for the returned product 
allowances for product returns are recorded during the period in which the related product sales are recognized  resulting in a reduction to product revenue 
we estimate product returns based upon the sales pattern of dificid  management experience with similar products  historical trends in the pharmaceutical industry and trends for similar products sold by others 
collaborations  milestones and royalties in order to determine the revenue recognition for contingent milestones  we evaluate the contingent milestones using the criteria as provided by the financial accounting standards boards  or fasb  guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition at the inception of a collaboration agreement 

table of contents accounting standard codification asc topic  revenue recognition milestone method asc  established the milestone method as an acceptable method of revenue recognition for certain contingent event based payments underresearch and development arrangements 
under the milestone method  a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
a milestone is an event i that can be achieved based in whole or in part on either our performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved  and iii that would result in additional payments being due to us 
the determination that a milestone is substantive is judgmental and is made at the inception of the arrangement 
milestones are considered substantive when the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is i commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relates solely to past performance and iii is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
other contingent event based payments received for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the results of a collaborative partner s performance are not considered milestones under asc in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc  such payments will be recognized as revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues recognized for royalty payments  if any  are recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of various research and collaboration agreements 
for collaboration agreements with multiple deliverables  we recognize collaboration revenues and expenses by analyzing each element of the agreement to determine if it is to be accounted for as a separate element or single unit of accounting 
if an element is to be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes  the revenue recognition principles most appropriate for that element are applied to determine when revenue is to be recognized 
if an element is not to be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes  the revenue recognition principles most appropriate for the bundled group of elements are applied to determine when revenue is to be recognized 
cash received in advance of services being performed is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as services are performed over the applicable term of the agreement 
in connection with certain research collaboration agreements  revenues are recognized from non refundable upfront fees  which we do not believe are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of the agreement 
research fees are recognized as revenue as the related research activities are performed 
with respect to revenues derived from reimbursement of direct out of pocket expenses for research costs associated with grants  where we act as a principal  with discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform part of the services required in the transaction  we record revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursement 
the costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of costs associated with clinical trials  compensation  including stock based compensation  and other expenses related to research and development  including personnel costs  facilities costs and depreciation 
when nonrefundable payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are made  we defer and capitalize these types of payments 
the capitalized amounts are expensed when the related goods are delivered or the services are performed 
stock based compensation the fasb authoritative guidance requires that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
we used the modified prospective method and accordingly we did not restate the results of operations for the prior periods 
compensation expense of million  million and million was recognized in the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of our stock awards based on the quoted market price of our common stock 

table of contents estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected term  expected dividends and risk free interest rates 
due to optimer s and obi s limited historical data  the expected volatility incorporates the historical volatility of comparable companies whose share prices are publicly available 
the average expected term is calculated using the simplified method for estimating the expected term 
expected dividends are estimated based on optimer s and obi s dividend history as well as optimer s and obi s current projections 
the risk free interest rate for optimer is based on the united states treasury rate for us treasury zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to the periods approximating the expected terms of the options 
the risk free rate for obi is based on the central bank of china interest rates 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis or sooner if there is a significant change in circumstances that could affect these assumptions 
equity instruments issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets unless  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
segment reporting our management has determined that we operate in one business segment which is the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase of million was primarily due to two milestone payments received or due to us from our astellas collaboration 
we received a million upfront payment from astellas in the first quarter of which payment was earned upon the delivery of the license and related know how which occurred in the quarter ended march  we also recorded a million milestone payment for the ema approval milestone receivable from astellas which we expect to receive days after the earlier to occur of six months after the ema approval or astellas launch in two major countries 
total revenues also included million of net product revenue from the sale of dificid 
included in the net product revenue recognized are reductions for wholesaler fees  returns and allowances  prompt pay discounts and government rebates and chargebacks 
cost and expenses cost of product sales 
cost of product sales for the year ended december  primarily represents the royalty due to par on net sales of dificid in the united states 
a significant portion of the product cost of dificid sold during the year was expensed as research and development expense when manufactured in the first quarter of since dificid had not been approved by the fda at that time 
cost of licensing 
cost of licensing represents a royalty to par based on the astellas upfront payment as well as the receivable related to the ema approval milestone 
we did not have a similar expense in the prior year 
research and development expense 
research and development expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to higher health economics and outcomes research  medical affairs  pharmacovigilance  publication expenses as well are higher research and development expense by obi for its phase breast cancer clinical trial 
the increase was partially offset by a million milestone payment due to par in for the successful completion of the second dificid phase trial 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  and was million and million respectively  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to the build up of our commercial infrastructure for the launch of dificid as well as a significant increase in related marketing expenses in we hired approximately hospital account managers in mid which significantly increased our compensation expenses and related personnel costs 
in addition  we expensed million related to the cubist service fee as part of our co promotion agreement 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net of  for the year ended december  was relatively consistent with the  for the year ended december  comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the increase of  or  was primarily due to a milestone payment received from cempra pharmaceuticals for the completion of its phase study for the treatment of respiratory infections 
expenses research and development expense 
research and development expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the decrease of  or  was due primarily to a decrease in dificid development expenses and manufacturing set up expenses reimbursable to biocon incurred in the prior year 
the decrease was offset by a million milestone to par for the successful completion of the second dificid phase trial and the regulatory filing fee for the dificid nda 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  and was million and million respectively  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to increased market research and pre commercial launch commercialization efforts related to our dificid program as well as higher consulting  recruitment and compensation expenses which included million of stock compensation expense  an increase of million over the same period in the prior year 
interest income and other  net 
net interest income and other of  for the year ended december  was relatively consistent with the  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity prior to our collaboration with astellas and subsequent launch of dificid in july  our operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity securities 
through december   we received gross proceeds of approximately million from the sale of shares of our preferred and common stock in various private and public financing transactions 
in march  pursuant to our collaboration and license agreement with astellas  we received approximately million as an upfront payment from astellas 
until required for operations  we invest a substantial portion of our available funds in money market funds  us government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments  all of which are investment grade quality 
we have established guidelines relating to diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
cash flows as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled approximately million as compared to million as of december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to the net million raised in a public offering of our common stock in february and a million upfront payment from astellas in march in connection with a collaboration and license agreement for dificid offset by the use of cash for our operating expenses 
additionally  in february  obi raised approximately million in gross proceeds in a private placement of common shares 
of our consolidated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million was held by obi as of december  
table of contents although we started selling dificid in july  we cannot be certain if  when or to what extent we will receive meaningful cash inflows from our commercialization activities 
we expect our commercialization expenses to be substantial and to increase over the next few years 
we also expect to continue to incur development expenses as we pursue life cycle management opportunities and build our pipeline 
on april   we entered into a co promotion agreement with cubist pursuant to which we engaged cubist as our exclusive partner for the promotion of dificid in the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  we and cubist have agreed to co promote dificid to physicians  hospitals  long term care facilities and other healthcare institutions as well as jointly provide medical affairs support for dificid 
in exchange for cubist s co promotion activities and personnel commitments  we are obligated to pay a quarterly fee of approximately million to cubist million per year which we began paying upon the commencement of the dificid sales program in the united states 
cubist is also eligible to receive an additional million in the first year after first commercial sale and million in the second year after first commercial sale if mutually agreed upon annual sales targets are achieved  as well as a portion of our gross profits derived from net sales above the specified annual targets  if any 
in february  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with astellas pursuant to which we granted to astellas an exclusive  royalty bearing license under certain of our know how and intellectual property to develop and commercialize fidaxomicin in the astellas territory 
under the terms of the license agreement with astellas  astellas paid to us an upfront fee of million 
we are eligible to receive additional cash payments totaling up to million euros upon the achievement by astellas of specified regulatory and commercial milestones 
million euros is due days after the earlier to occur of launch of fidaxomicin in two major countries or six months after ema approval of the mma for dificlir  which occurred in december and million euros will become due days after the launch of a fidaxomicin in any astellas territory 
we currently expect to receive these two milestone payments no later than mid in addition  we will be entitled to receive escalating double digit royalties ranging from the high teens to low twenties on net sales of dificid products in the astellas territory  which royalties are subject to reduction in certain  limited circumstances 
such royalties will be payable by astellas on a product by product and country by country basis until a generic product accounts for a specified market share of the applicable fidaxomicin product in the applicable country 
in june  we entered into a commercial manufacturing services agreement with patheon inc to manufacture and supply fidaxomicin drug products  including dificid  in north america  europe and other countries  subject to agreement by the parties to any additional fees for such countries 
we agreed to purchase a specified percentage of our fidaxomicin product requirements for north america and europe from patheon or its affiliates 
in may  we entered into a long term supply agreement with biocon limited  or biocon  for the commercial manufacture of fidaxomicin s active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api 
pursuant to the agreement  biocon agreed to manufacture and supply to us  up to certain limits  fidaxomicin api and  subject to certain conditions  we agreed to purchase from biocon at least a portion of our requirements for fidaxomicin api in the united states and canada 
we previously paid to biocon million for certain equipment purchases and manufacturing scale up activities  and we may be entitled to recover up to million of this amount under the supply agreement in the form of discounted prices for fidaxomicin api 
in february  we regained worldwide rights to fidaxomicin from par under a prospective buy back agreement 
we paid par a one time million milestone payment in june for our successful completion of the second phase trial for fidaxomicin 
we are obligated to pay par a royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates of fidaxomicin in north america and israel  and a royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates of fidaxomicin in the rest of the world 
in addition  we are required to pay par a royalty on net revenues we receive from licensees of our right to market fidaxomicin in the rest of the world 
we are obligated to pay each of these royalties  if any  on a country by country basis for seven years commencing on the applicable commercial launch in each such country 
in march  we paid par a million royalty payment associated with the upfront payment we received under the astellas agreement 
funding requirements our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the following our ability to successfully market and sell dificid in the united states and other fidaxomicin products in countries outside the united states  the costs of establishing  maintaining and managing our commercial infrastructure  including our sales or distribution capabilities and the timing of such efforts  
table of contents the amount and timing of payments we may receive or be required to make under strategic collaborations  including licensing  co promotion and other arrangements  our decision to partner or license fidaxomicin or commercialize fidaxomicin ourselves in countries outside the united states and the astellas territory  our decision to conduct future clinical trials  including the timing and progress of such clinical trials  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including licensing and other arrangements  the costs of preparing and pursuing applications for regulatory approvals and the timing of such approvals  the costs involved in prosecuting  enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we in license  acquire or invest in other indications  products  technologies and businesses 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents plus the two milestone payments from astellas will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next months 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources  revenues from sales of dificid in the united states and revenues from existing and future collaboration agreements 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of additional equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in completing future equity financings  in entering into additional collaboration agreements  in receiving milestone or royalty payments under new or existing collaboration agreements  in obtaining new government grants or in obtaining debt financing 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate  that financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
the credit markets continue to be volatile  which volatility has generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain  and may negatively impact our ability to complete financing transactions 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our planned commercialization activities and development programs  relinquish some or even all of our rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or negotiate less favorable terms for rights to our products or product candidates than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise funds by incurring debt  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table describes our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands operating lease obligations our facilities currently consist of laboratory and office space in two facilities in san diego  california  and office space in jersey city  new jersey 
our operating leases for our san diego facilities have an original expiration of november but were extended through july we plan to consolidate our san diego offices and in december  we entered into an operating lease agreement for laboratory and office space in san diego for a year lease term with a two five year renewal option 
we expect to move in the new facility in august the operating lease in new jersey is subject to a one five year renewal option 
we had firm purchase order commitments for the acquisition of inventory from biocon and patheon as of december  and of million and zero  respectively

recently issued accounting pronouncements fasb issued the following accounting amendments in may  the fasb issued an update to existing guidance on fair value measurement and disclosure requirements under us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the amendments in this update change the wording used to describe many of the requirements under us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the amendments in this update will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively 
the adoption of these amendments is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  cash flow or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued an update which amends the presentation of comprehensive income 
the objective of this update is to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
under this update  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under either choice  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
the amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively 
the adoption of these amendments is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  cash flow or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash equivalents and marketable securities risk our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds and us government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in an approximately  change in net income 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates applicable to our securities portfolio 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds and united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in approximately a  change in net loss 
fair value measurements all of our investment securities are available for sale securities and are reported on the consolidated balance sheet at market value except for one auction rate preferred securities or arps with a par value of approximately million 
as a result of the negative conditions in the global credit markets  our arps is currently not liquid 
in the event we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  until the securities are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
foreign currency risk while we operate primarily in the united states  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
our agreement with astellas includes milestone and royalty payments which are denominated in euros 
our dificid api manufacturer  biocon  is located in india and our manufacturer of dificid tablets  patheon  is located in canada 
although we pay biocon and patheon in us dollars changes in the rupee and the canadian dollar may result in price adjustments and affect our operating results 

table of contents in addition  certain transactions related to us and our subsidiary  obi  are denominated primarily in taiwan dollars 
we also recently established a subsidiary in canada  optimer pharmaceuticals canada  inc and we expect optimer canada s transactions to be denominated primarily in canadian dollars 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets where we conduct business  including the impact of the existing conditions in the global financial markets in such countries and the impact on both the us dollar  the new taiwan dollar and the canadian dollar 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not engage in exchange rate hedging or hold or issue foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
in anticipation of a million euro milestone payment from astellas when we received the ema approval of fidaxomicin  we entered in a forward contract to limit our foreign currency exposure to euro 
and thus  we do not expect the impact of fluctuations in the relative fair value of the euro to be material to our results of operations
