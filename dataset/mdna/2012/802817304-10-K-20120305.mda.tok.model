we have also licensed certain exclusive rights to glaxo group limited  an affiliate of glaxosmithkline  plc  or gsk  to develop  manufacture and commercialize prescription and over the counter  or otc  products in up to specified countries including markets within africa  asia  the middle east  and central and south america 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
principles of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of santarus and its wholly owned subsidiary  covella pharmaceuticals  inc  or covella 
we do not have any interest in variable interest entities 
all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

table of contents inventories and related reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
inventories consist of finished goods and raw materials used in the manufacture of our commercial products 
we provide reserves for potentially excess  dated or obsolete inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments compared to forecasts of future sales 
business combinations the revised authoritative guidance for business combinations establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring the total consideration transferred to and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquired target in a business combination 
we accounted for the acquisition of covella in september in accordance with the revised authoritative guidance for business combinations 
the consideration paid to acquire covella was required to be measured at fair value and included cash consideration  the issuance of our common stock and contingent consideration  which includes our obligation to make clinical and regulatory milestone payments based on success in developing product candidates in addition to a royalty on net sales of any commercial products resulting from the anti vla mab technology 
after the total consideration transferred was calculated by determining the fair value of the contingent consideration plus the upfront cash and stock consideration  we assigned the purchase price of covella to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this allocation of the purchase price resulted in recognition of intangible assets related to in process research and development  or ipr d  and goodwill 
we accounted for the commercialization agreement with depomed  inc  or depomed  entered into in august in accordance with the revised authoritative guidance for business combinations 
the purchase consideration was comprised of cash payments for the purchase of existing inventory  and the entire purchase price was allocated to inventory  as cost approximated fair value  and no other assets were acquired and no liabilities were assumed in the transaction 
under the commercialization agreement  we have an obligation to pay royalties to depomed based on glumetza net product sales 
these royalties are being expensed as incurred as we determined that the royalty rates reflect reasonable market rates for the manufacturing and commercialization rights we were granted under the commercialization agreement 
we accounted for the license agreement with cowen healthcare royalty partners  lp  or chrp  and shore therapeutics  inc  or shore  in accordance with the revised authoritative guidance for business combinations 
the purchase consideration was comprised of an upfront cash payment  and the purchase price was allocated to prepaid royalty expense and intangible assets related to the license agreement 
there were no other assets acquired or liabilities assumed under the license agreement 
under the license agreement  we have an obligation to pay royalties to shore based on fenoglide net product sales and certain one time success based milestones contingent on sales achievement 
these royalties and sales milestones will be expensed as incurred as we determined that the royalty rates and sales milestone amounts reflect reasonable market rates for the manufacturing and commercialization rights granted under the license agreement 
the determination and allocation of consideration transferred in a business combination requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration 
the key assumptions in determining the fair value are the discount rate and the probability assigned to the potential milestone or royalty being achieved 
we remeasure the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period  with any change in fair value being recorded in the current period s operating expenses 
changes in the fair value may result from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date  such as changes in the estimated probability or timing of achieving the milestone or royalty 
intangible assets and goodwill our intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired ipr d and license agreements 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from business combinations 
we periodically assess the carrying value of our intangible assets and goodwill  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments 
table of contents regarding the future cash flows of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  and the impact of significant negative industry  regulatory or economic trends 
ipr d will not be amortized until the related development process is complete  and goodwill is not amortized 
license agreements and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined by a combination of third party sources and forecasted discounted cash flows 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used 
we also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies 
a change in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates could result in an impairment charge which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we have not recognized any impairment charges on our intangible assets or goodwill through december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
product sales  net 
we sell our glumetza  cycloset  fenoglide and zegerid products primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors 
we are obligated to accept from customers products that are returned within six months of their expiration date or up to months beyond their expiration date 
the shelf life of our products from the date of manufacture is as follows glumetza to months  cycloset months  fenoglide to months  and zegerid months 
we authorize returns for expired or damaged products in accordance with our return goods policy and procedures 
we issue credit to the customer for expired or damaged returned product 
we rarely exchange product from inventory for returned product 
at the time of sale  we record our estimates for product returns as a reduction to revenue at full sales value with a corresponding increase in the allowance for product returns liability 
actual returns are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for product returns liability at sales value with a corresponding decrease in accounts receivable for credit issued to the customer 
we recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for product returns  estimated rebates in connection with contracts relating to managed care  medicare  and patient coupons and voucher programs  and estimated chargebacks from distributors  wholesaler fees and prompt payment and other discounts 
we establish allowances for estimated product returns  rebates and chargebacks based primarily on the following qualitative and quantitative factors the number of and specific contractual terms of agreements with customers  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel  estimated remaining shelf life of products  analysis of prescription data gathered by a third party prescription data provider  direct communication with customers  historical product returns  rebates and chargebacks  anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors  and the impact of state and federal regulations 
in our analyses  we utilize prescription data purchased from a third party data provider to develop estimates of historical inventory channel pull through 
we utilize a separate analysis which compares historical product shipments less returns to estimated historical prescriptions written 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the distribution channel which may be subject to various product return  rebate and chargeback exposures 

table of contents our estimates of product returns  rebates and chargebacks require our most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual future payments for returns  rebates  chargebacks and other discounts exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
our allowance for product returns was million as of december  and million as of december  we recognize product sales at the time title passes to our customers  and we provide for an estimate of future product returns at that time based upon historical product returns trends  analysis of product expiration dating and estimated inventory levels in the distribution channel  review of returns trends for similar products  if available  and the other factors discussed above 
due to the lengthy shelf life of our products and the terms of our returns policy  there may be a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated allowance and when we receive the product return and issue credit to a customer 
therefore  the amount of returns processed against the allowance in a particular year generally has no direct correlation to the product sales in the same year  and we may record adjustments to our estimated allowance over several periods  which can result in a net increase or a net decrease in our operating results in those periods 
we have been tracking our zegerid product returns history by individual production batches from the time of our first commercial product launch of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in late  taking into consideration product expiration dating and estimated inventory levels in the distribution channel 
we launched cycloset in november and began distributing fenoglide in december we have provided for an estimate of cycloset and fenoglide product returns based upon our review of returns trends for similar products and taking into consideration the effect of a product s shelf life on its returns history 
under a new commercialization agreement with depomed  we began distributing and recording product sales for glumetza in september we have provided for an estimate of glumetza product returns based upon the glumetza product returns history and taking into consideration the effect of a product s shelf life on its returns history 
our provision for product returns provided in schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively  which reflected an increase in the provision for product returns as a percentage of the related gross product sales from to and a decrease in the provision for product returns as a percentage of the related gross product sales from to the increase in the provision for product returns as a percentage of the related gross product sales from to reflects the higher estimated returns rates of certain of our cycloset and glumetza products due to the shorter shelf lives of these products 
the decrease in the provision for product returns as a percentage of the related gross product sales from to was based on our analysis of our zegerid product returns history since the first commercial launch of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in late through the end of  which analysis reflected decreases in the actual returns rates for our zegerid products over time 
although we have experienced decreased sales volumes of our zegerid products resulting from par pharmaceutical  inc s  or par s  commencement of commercial sale of a generic version of our zegerid capsules in late june  given the lengthy shelf life of our zegerid products ie months from the date of manufacture  we determined that our allowance for product returns was adequate  and no increase in the returns rate was necessary in our allowance for rebates  chargebacks and other discounts was million as of december  and million as of december  these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for rebates due to managed care organizations under specific contracts  rebates due to various organizations under medicare contracts and regulations  chargebacks due to various organizations purchasing our products through federal contracts and or group purchasing agreements  and other rebates and customer discounts due in connection with wholesaler fees and prompt payment and other discounts 
we estimate our liability for rebates and chargebacks at each reporting period based on a combination of the qualitative and quantitative assumptions listed above 
in each reporting period  we evaluate our outstanding contracts and apply the contractual discounts to the invoiced price of wholesaler shipments recognized 
although the total invoiced price of shipments to wholesalers for the reporting period and the contractual terms are known during the reporting period  we project the ultimate disposition of the sale eg future utilization rates of cash payors  managed care  medicare or other contracted organizations 
this estimate is based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes based on specific contractual terms of new agreements with 
table of contents customers  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors and the other qualitative and quantitative factors described above 
there may be a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated allowance and when we make the contractual payment or issue credit to a customer 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated allowance over several periods  which can result in a net increase or a net decrease in our operating results in those periods 
for the year ended december   we recorded a decrease in our estimated allowance for accrued rebates associated with product sales in prior periods of million due to decreased utilization under  as well as the termination of  certain of our managed care and other contracts associated with our zegerid products 
our estimate for accrued rebates was impacted by reduced sales volumes resulting from par s commencement of its commercial sale of a generic version of zegerid capsules prescription products and our decision to cease promotion of our zegerid prescription products at that time 
absent this discrete event  actual results were not materially different from our estimates for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  actual results were not materially different from our estimates 
our provision for cash discounts  chargebacks and other sales discounts provided in schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the provision for cash discounts  chargebacks and other sales discounts as a percentage of the related gross product sales increased from to and remained relatively consistent from to the provision for cash discounts  chargebacks and other sales discounts as a percentage of the related gross product sales is impacted by utilization under contracts as well as the specific contractual terms 
the increase in cash discounts  chargebacks and other sales discounts as a percentage of the related gross product sales from to reflected an increase in wholesaler fees 
in addition  as a result of par s launch of the generic version of zegerid capsules in late june  sales under chargeback contracts for zegerid capsules generally decreased at a lower rate than the non contracted portion of the zegerid business in in late june  we began selling an authorized generic version of our prescription zegerid capsules under a distribution and supply agreement with prasco 
prasco has agreed to purchase all of its authorized generic product requirements from us and pays a specified invoice supply price for such products 
we recognize revenue from shipments to prasco at the invoice supply price and the related cost of product sales when title transfers  which is generally at the time of shipment 
we are also entitled to receive a percentage of the gross margin on sales of the authorized generic products by prasco  which we recognize as an addition to product sales  net when prasco reports to us the gross margin from the ultimate sale of the products 
any adjustments to the gross margin related to prasco s estimated sales discounts and other deductions are recognized in the period prasco reports the amounts to us 
promotion  royalty and other license revenue 
we analyze each element of our promotion and licensing agreements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
prior to january   we recognized revenue on upfront payments over the period of significant involvement under the related agreements unless the fee was in exchange for products delivered or services rendered that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process and no further performance obligation existed under the contract 
effective january   we adopted the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables materially modified or entered into after december  under this guidance  we identify the deliverables included within the agreement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting 
upfront license fees are generally recognized upon delivery of the license if the facts and circumstances dictate that the license has standalone value from any undelivered items  the relative selling price allocation of the license is equal to or exceeds the upfront license fees  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  our price to the partner is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
upfront license fees are deferred if facts and circumstances dictate that the license does not have standalone value 
the determination of the length of the period over which to defer revenue is subject to judgment and estimation and can have an impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
effective january   we adopted prospectively  the authoritative guidance that offers an alternative method of revenue recognition for milestone payments 
under the milestone method guidance  we recognize payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone  as defined in the guidance  in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
other milestones that do not fall under the definition of a milestone under the milestone method are recognized under the authoritative guidance concerning revenue recognition 
sales milestones  royalties and promotion fees are based on sales and or gross margin information  which may include estimates of sales discounts and other deductions  received from the relevant alliance agreement partner 
sales 
table of contents milestones  royalties and promotion fees are recognized as revenue when earned under the agreements  and any adjustments related to estimated sales discounts and other deductions are recognized in the period the alliance agreement partner reports the amounts to us 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights granted using the black scholes valuation model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected life of the stock option  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
in determining our volatility factor  we perform an analysis of the historical volatility of our common stock for a period corresponding to the expected life of the options 
in addition  we consider the expected volatility of similar entities 
in evaluating similar entities  we consider factors such as industry  stage of development  size and financial leverage 
in determining the expected life of the options  we use the simplified method 
under this method  the expected life is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
we will continue to use the simplified method until we have sufficient historical exercise data to estimate the expected life of the options 
the fair value of options granted is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period ranging from one to four years 
pre vesting forfeitures were estimated to be approximately for the years ended december   and as the majority of options granted contain monthly vesting terms 
the following table includes stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in thousands years ended december  cost of product sales research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charges total as of december   total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was approximately million  and the weighted average period over which it was expected to be recognized was years 
income taxes we provide for income taxes under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
we follow the authoritative guidance relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this guidance clarifies the recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
please see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements adoption of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued authoritative guidance concerning the recognition and classification of the new annual fee payable by branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers on branded prescription drugs which was mandated under the health care reform legislation enacted in the us in march under this new authoritative guidance  the annual fee should be estimated and recognized in full as a liability upon the first qualifying commercial sale with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating expenses using a straight line method unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year in which it is payable 
this new guidance is effective for calendar years beginning on or after december   when the fee initially became effective 
upon adoption  this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb ratified the final consensus that offers an alternative method of revenue recognition for milestone payments 
the guidance states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to recognize a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone  as defined in the guidance  in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  with early adoption permitted  provided that the revised guidance is applied retrospectively to the beginning of the year of adoption 
we elected to adopt this guidance prospectively  effective for our fiscal year beginning january  upon adoption  the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the guidance may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements 
we elected to adopt this guidance prospectively  effective for our fiscal year beginning january  upon adoption  the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this newly issued authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity  requires the consecutive presentation of the statement of net income and other comprehensive income  and requires an entity to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements from other comprehensive income to net income 
the amendments in this authoritative guidance do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income nor do the amendments affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
the authoritative guidance is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued guidance which defers the requirement for entities to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented 
this requirement has been indefinitely deferred and will be further deliberated by the fasb at a future date 
during the deferral  entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect prior to the issuance of the new guidance 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our future financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued an update to the authoritative guidance on performing goodwill impairment testing 
under the revised guidance  entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit step of the goodwill impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required  otherwise  no further testing is 
table of contents required 
the revised guidance does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units  does not revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment  and does not amend the requirement to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events and circumstances warrant 
the revised authoritative guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our future financial position and results of operations 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and product sales  net 
product sales  net were million for  million for and million for and consisted of sales of zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension 
in and  product sales  net also consisted of sales of the authorized generic version of zegerid capsules under our distribution and supply agreement with prasco and sales of cycloset which we launched in november in  product sales  net also consisted of sales of glumetza which we began distributing in september and fenoglide which we began distributing in december the million decrease in product sales  net from to was comprised of approximately million related to a decrease in sales of our zegerid products  including the authorized generic products  partially offset by approximately million in sales of glumetza and an increase of approximately million in sales of cycloset 
the million decrease in product sales  net from to was comprised of approximately million related to a decrease in sales volume comprised primarily of our zegerid products  including the authorized generic products  offset by approximately million related to increased average selling prices 
the decrease in zegerid sales volume from to and to resulted from par s commencement of commercial sale of its generic version of our zegerid capsules prescription products in late june promotion revenue 
promotion revenue was million for  million for and million for and was comprised of fees earned under our promotion agreement with depomed for the promotion of glumetza prescription products 
promotion revenue for was based on glumetza sales recorded by depomed for january through august and which sales were impacted by an increase of million in depomed s allowance for product returns related to a glumetza pricing action taken in august the promotion agreement was replaced by a new commercialization agreement with depomed under which we began distributing and recording product sales for glumetza in september glumetza mg was the subject of a voluntary recall and supply interruption which resulted in the unavailability of this dosage strength from june through early january shipments of glumetza mg resumed in january royalty revenue 
royalty revenue was million for and million for and was comprised of royalty revenue earned under our license agreement with merck for zegerid otc and our license agreement with gsk for prescription and otc immediate release omeprazole products in specified countries outside the us merck commenced commercial sales of zegerid otc products in the first quarter of  and gsk commenced commercial sales in mexico in the second quarter of and kenya in the fourth quarter of there was no royalty revenue for other license revenue 
other license revenue was  for and was comprised of the remaining amortization of the upfront payment we received in october in connection with our license agreement with norgine bv  or norgine 
other license revenue was million for and included a million one time nonrefundable milestone payment we received from merck in december following the approval of the new drug application  or nda  submitted by merck for zegerid otc 
we recognized the milestone payment of million in other license revenue in due to the substantive nature of the milestone achieved 
other license revenue in also included amortization of upfront payments under license agreements received from norgine in  gsk in and merck in there was no other license revenue in cost of product sales 
cost of product sales was million for  million for and million for  or approximately  and of net product sales  respectively 
cost of product sales consists primarily of raw materials  third party manufacturing costs  freight and indirect personnel and other overhead costs associated with the sales of our glumetza  cycloset  fenoglide and zegerid prescription products as well as 
table of contents shipments to prasco of the authorized generic version of zegerid capsules 
cost of product sales also includes reserves for excess  dated or obsolete commercial inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments compared to forecasts of future sales 
the increase in our cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales from to was primarily attributable to certain fixed costs being applied to decreased sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs associated with glumetza and cycloset 
the increase in our cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales from to was primarily attributable to a reserve of approximately million recognized in against on hand inventories of our zegerid products in connection with the launch of generic and authorized generic versions of prescription zegerid capsules and our related decision to cease promotion of zegerid 
license fees and royalties 
license fees and royalties were million for  million for and million for license fees and royalties consist of royalties due to the university of missouri based upon net product sales of our zegerid prescription products  sales of zegerid otc by merck under our license agreement and products sold by gsk under our license agreement  and royalties due to depomed under our commercialization agreement based upon net product sales of glumetza 
in addition  license fees and royalties include milestone payments and upfront fees expensed or amortized under license agreements  as well as amounts payable to s therapeutics  inc  or s  and veroscience  llc  or veroscience  based on a percentage of the gross margin associated with net sales of cycloset 
license fees and royalties also include changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to business combinations 
the million decrease in license fees and royalties from to was primarily due to certain upfront fees and milestone payments expensed in as follows a million upfront fee we paid to pharming group nv  or pharming  in september under our license and supply agreements  a million accrual related to the one time million sales milestone due to depomed based on glumetza net product sales in excess of million during the month period ending january and a milestone payment to cosmo technologies limited  or cosmo  under our license agreement based on the achievement of both of the primary endpoints in the phase iii studies for uceris 
cosmo elected to receive payment through the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
the fair value of the shares issued to cosmo was approximately million 
additionally  the decrease in license fees and royalties from to resulted from a decrease in royalties due to the university of missouri based on decreased sales of zegerid prescription products 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in the product royalty payable to s and veroscience based on the gross margin associated with net sales of cycloset and the royalties due to depomed based upon net product sales of glumetza which commenced in september the million increase in license fees and royalties from to was primarily due to the upfront fee paid to pharming and the milestones paid to depomed and cosmo expensed in research and development 
research and development expenses were million for  million for and million for the million increase in our research and development expenses from to was primarily attributable to an increase in costs associated with our phase i clinical study with san and increased compensation costs associated with an increase in research and development personnel and annual merit increases  offset in part by a decrease in costs associated with our uceris and rifamycin sv mmx phase iii clinical programs 
the million increase in our research and development expenses from to was primarily attributable to costs associated with our rifamycin sv mmx phase iii clinical program which was initiated in the second quarter of  start up costs associated with our phase ii proof of concept study evaluating recombinant human c inhibitor in early antibody mediated rejection in renal transplant patients and increased compensation costs associated with an increase in research and development personnel and annual merit increases 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in our research and development expenses related to the uceris phase iii clinical program 
in connection with our strategic collaboration with cosmo entered into in december  we are developing two product candidates targeting gastrointestinal  or gi  conditions 
uceris is a non systemic corticosteroid in a novel oral tablet formulation  dosed one tablet once daily  which utilizes proprietary mmx colonic delivery technology and is being developed for the treatment of ulcerative colitis 
we have announced statistically significant top line results according to our statistical analysis plan from two phase iii clinical studies which evaluated uceris mg for the induction of remission of mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis 
additionally  we announced top line safety data from a month  double blind  extended use study 
in december  we submitted an nda for uceris to the fda seeking approval to market uceris mg tablets for the induction of remission of mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis 
the fda accepted our nda for filing in february in 
table of contents connection with the ongoing development and potential future commercialization of uceris  in february  we began patient enrollment in a phase iiib multicenter  randomized  double blind placebo controlled clinical study evaluating whether there is an incremental benefit when uceris mg is added to current oral aminosalicylate  or asa  therapy for patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis who are not adequately controlled on background asa therapy

we have acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to san through the acquisition of covella and a related license agreement with biogen idec ma  or biogen 
san is a humanized anti vla mab and has shown activity in multiple preclinical models of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
we believe that san may have potential application as a drug candidate in multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis  inflammatory bowel disease  psoriasis and organ transplantation 
we initiated a multicenter  randomized  placebo controlled  single dose  dose escalation phase i clinical study with san in march  which study we expect to be completed in the first half of research and development expenses have historically consisted primarily of costs associated with clinical studies of our products under development as well as clinical studies designed to further differentiate our products from those of our competitors  development of and preparation for commercial manufacturing of our products  compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel and facilities expenses 
a substantial portion of our external research and development costs is tracked on a direct project basis 
however  because our internal research and development resources are used in several projects  the related indirect costs are not attributable to a specific development product candidate 
for example  personnel and facility related costs are not tracked on a project basis 
we have summarized the costs associated with our development programs in the following table in thousands 
costs that are not attributable to a specific product candidate  including salaries and related personnel and facilities costs  are included in the indirect costs category 
year ended december  project to date through december  direct costs uceris rifamycin sv mmx rhucin san zegerid and other projects   n a total direct costs indirect costs    n a total research and development project to date amounts are included for projects on which we are primarily focused

we are unable to estimate with any certainty the research and development costs that we may incur in the future 
in addition  in connection with the approval of our ndas for zegerid powder for oral suspension  we committed to commence clinical studies to evaluate the product in pediatric populations in we have not yet commenced any of the studies and have requested a waiver of this requirement from the fda 
we received an initial response from the fda waiving certain of the requirements and plan to seek further clarification

in addition  our cash requirements will depend on market acceptance of any other products that we may market in the future  the success of our strategic alliances  the resources we devote to researching  developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products  and our ability to enter into third party collaborations 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and use of our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the next twelve months  however  our projected revenue may decrease or our expenses may increase and that would lead to our cash resources being consumed earlier than we expect 
although we do not believe that we will need to raise additional funds to finance our current operations through at least the next twelve months  we may pursue raising additional funds in connection with licensing or acquisition of new products or the continued development of our product candidates 
sources of additional funds may include funds generated through equity and or debt financings or through strategic collaborations or licensing agreements 
our existing universal shelf registration statement was declared effective in december and may permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to an additional approximately million of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include the progress of our commercial and development activities  investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets  among others 
in july  we entered into our loan agreement with comerica  which was most recently amended in february  pursuant to which we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed million 
in december  we drew down million under the loan agreement 
the revolving loan bears interest  as selected by us  at a variable rate of interest  per annum  most recently announced by comerica as its prime rate or the libor rate plus 
interest payments on advances made under the loan agreement are due and payable in arrears on the first calendar day of each month during the term of the loan agreement 
the february amendment to the loan agreement extends the maturity date of the revolving line from july  to february  amounts borrowed under the loan agreement may be repaid and re borrowed at any time prior to february   and any outstanding principal drawn during the term of the loan facility is due and payable on february  the loan agreement will remain in full force and effect for so long as any obligations remain outstanding or comerica has any obligation to make credit extensions under the loan agreement 
amounts borrowed under the loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our personal property  excluding intellectual property 
under the loan agreement  we are subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on our ability to undergo certain change of control events  convey  sell  lease  license  transfer or otherwise dispose of assets  create  incur  assume  guarantee or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness  grant liens  pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments  and make investments 
in addition  under the loan agreement  we are required to maintain our cash balances with either comerica or another financial institution covered by a control agreement for the benefit of comerica 
we are also subject to specified financial covenants with respect to a minimum liquidity ratio and  in specified limited circumstances  minimum ebitda requirements 
we believe we have currently met all of our obligations under the loan agreement 

table of contents we cannot be certain that our existing cash and marketable securities resources and use of our line of credit will be adequate to sustain our current operations 
to the extent we require additional funding  we cannot be certain that such funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities  our stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
if adequate funds are not available on terms acceptable to us at that time  our ability to continue our current operations or pursue new product opportunities would be significantly limited 
in addition  our results of operations could be materially affected by economic conditions generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated economic uncertainty 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many negative ways  including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary  and our stock price may further decline 
in addition  we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits 
given the current instability of financial institutions  we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on these deposits 
in march  the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act  which makes extensive changes to the delivery of healthcare in the us this act includes numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies  some of which are effective immediately and others of which will be taking effect over the next several years 
for example  the act seeks to expand healthcare coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of medicaid 
the act also imposes substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers  such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to medicaid  new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the medicare prescription drug benefit  an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the us  and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics 
the act also contains cost containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for healthcare items and services generally  including pharmaceuticals 
it also will require reporting and public disclosure of payments and other transfers of value provided by pharmaceutical companies to physicians and teaching hospitals 
these measures could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decreased potential returns from our development efforts 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the terms of our loan agreement with comerica bank  or comerica  the interest rate applicable to any amounts borrowed by us under the credit facility will be  at our election  indexed to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
if we elect comerica s prime rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  the interest rate will be variable  which would expose us to the risk of increased interest expense if interest rates rise 
if we elect the libor rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  such libor rate will remain fixed only for a specified  limited period of time after the date of our election  after which we will be required to repay the borrowed amount  or elect a new interest rate indexed to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
the new rate may be higher than the earlier interest rate applicable under the loan agreement 
as of december   the balance outstanding under the credit facility was million  and we had elected the prime rate plus interest rate option  which was as of december  under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the interest rate under the loan agreement would not materially affect our interest expense at our current level of borrowing 

table of contents in addition to market risk related to our loan agreement with comerica  we are exposed to market risk primarily in the area of changes in us interest rates and conditions in the credit markets  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
our short term investment securities have consisted of corporate debt securities  government agency securities and us treasury securities which are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the consolidated balance sheets at estimated market value 
our results of operations could be materially affected by economic conditions generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world
