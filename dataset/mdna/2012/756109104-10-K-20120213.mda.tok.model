item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general realty income corporation  the monthly dividend company  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust  or reit 
our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations  or ffo  per share 
our monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to retail and other commercial enterprises 
we have in house acquisition  leasing  legal  credit research  real estate research  portfolio management and capital markets expertise 
over the past years  realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail and other properties that generate rental revenue under long term lease agreements primarily to years 
in addition  we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 
at december   we owned a diversified portfolio of  properties  with an occupancy rate of  or  properties leased and only properties available for lease  leased to different retail and other commercial enterprises doing business in separate industries  located in states  with over million square feet of leasable space  and with an average leasable space per property of approximately  square feet 
of the  properties in the portfolio   or  are single tenant properties  and the remaining are multi tenant properties 
at december   of the  single tenant properties   were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant of approximately years 
liquidity and capital resources capital philosophy historically  we have met our long term capital needs by issuing common stock  preferred stock and long term unsecured notes and bonds 
over the long term  we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure 
however  we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time 
we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties 
in addition  we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 
our primary cash obligations  for the current year and subsequent years  are included in the table of obligations  which is presented later in this section 
we expect to fund our operating expenses and other short term liquidity requirements  including property acquisitions and development costs  payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness  property improvements  re leasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders  primarily through cash provided by operating activities  borrowing on our million credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings 
conservative capital structure we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure 
therefore  we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
at december   our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds  mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were billion  or approximately of our total market capitalization of billion 

table of contents we define our total market capitalization at december  as the sum of shares of our common stock outstanding of  multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of per share on december   or billion  aggregate liquidation value par value of per share of the class d preferred stock of million  aggregate liquidation value par value of per share of the class e preferred stock of million  outstanding mortgages payable of million  outstanding borrowings of million on our credit facility  and outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of billion 
mortgage debt as of december   we have million of mortgages payable to third party lenders that were assumed in  in connection with our property acquisitions 
we paid  in principal payments on these mortgages payable during additionally  net premiums totaling  in aggregate  were recorded upon assumption of the mortgages payable at the time of the respective property acquisitions to account for above market interest rates 
we recorded amortization of  related to these net premiums during our mortgages payable are secured by the properties on which the debt was placed and are non recourse 
we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties and costs make it economically feasible to do so 
we intend to continue our policy of primarily identifying property acquisitions that are free from mortgage indebtedness 
million acquisition credit facility we have a million unsecured  revolving credit facility 
the initial term of the credit facility expires in march and includes two  one year extension options 
under the credit facility  the current investment grade credit ratings on our debt securities provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate  commonly referred to as libor  plus basis points with a facility commitment fee of basis points  for all in drawn pricing of basis points over libor 
the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling 
we also have other interest rate options available to us under the credit facility 
at december   we had a borrowing capacity of million available on our credit facility subject to customary conditions to borrowing and an outstanding balance of million 
as a result of the issuance of our class f preferred stock in february  we paid off all outstanding credit facility borrowings on february  the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at december  was per annum 
we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility 
at december   we remain in compliance with these covenants 
we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes 
any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility  up to million  to a total borrowing capacity of million 
any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility 
cash reserves we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders  in the form of monthly cash distributions  a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties 
we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash provided from operating activities  and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we intend  however  to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 

table of contents acquisitions during during  we invested billion in new properties  and properties under development  with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 
the majority of the lease revenue from these properties will be generated from tenants that have investment grade ratings on their senior debt securities 
these new properties  and properties under development  are located in states  contain over million leasable square feet  and are leased with an average lease term of years 
the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a net leased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent or  in the case of a property under development  the estimated base rent for the first year of each lease  divided by the estimated total cost of the properties 
since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent  we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 
included in the billion invested during are the acquisition of single tenant retail  distribution  office and manufacturing properties for approximately million  under long term  net lease agreements 
the acquisition of properties operating in the restaurant quick service industry for million  under long term  net lease agreements 
the acquisition of six properties operating in the wholesale clubs industry for million  under long term  net lease agreements 
the acquisition of properties operating in the grocery store industry for million under long term  net lease agreements 
the acquisition of nine properties operating in the health and fitness industry for million  under long term  net lease agreements 
the remaining properties acquired totaled approximately million 
portfolio discussion leasing results at december   we had properties available for lease out of  properties in our portfolio  which represents a occupancy rate 
since december   when we reported properties available for lease and a occupancy rate  we leased properties  sold properties available for lease  and have new properties available for lease 
during  properties with expiring leases were leased to either existing or new tenants 
the rent on these leases was million  as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of million 
at december   our average annualized rental revenue per square foot was approximately 
investments in existing properties in  we capitalized costs of million on existing properties in our portfolio  consisting of million for re leasing costs and million for building and tenant improvements 
in  we capitalized costs of million on existing properties in our portfolio  consisting of million for re leasing costs and million for building improvements 
as part of our re leasing costs  we pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions 
leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal 
we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents the majority of our building and tenant improvements are related to roof repairs  hvac improvements  and parking lot resurfacing and replacements 
it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives 
the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly  depending on the rental market  credit worthiness  and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases 
impact of real estate and credit markets in the commercial real estate market  property prices generally continue to fluctuate 
likewise  the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which may impact our access to and cost of capital 
we continue to monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and  if required  will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 
see our discussion of risk factors in this annual report 
increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders we continue our year policy of paying distributions monthly 
monthly distributions per common share increased in april to  in july to  in october to and in january to 
the increase in january was our th consecutive quarterly increase and the th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the nyse in in  we paid three monthly cash distributions per common share in the amount of  three in the amount of  three in the amount of and three in the amount of  totaling

the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus basis points if our credit facility is lower than bbb baa and ii libor plus basis points if our credit rating is a a or higher 
in addition  our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings  which ranges from i basis points for a rating lower than bbb baa  and ii basis points for a credit rating of a a or higher 
we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions 
if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change  our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease 

table of contents the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if  in its judgment  circumstances warrant

table of contents matters pertaining to certain tenants in january  friendly ice cream corporation  or friendly s  one of our tenants  announced that it was emerging from voluntary reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code which they had filed for in october 
pursuant to the bankruptcy proceedings  friendly s accepted of their leases with us 
friendly s rejected leases with us  representing approximately million of annualized rent  and received rent concessions and term reductions on some of their accepted leases with us 
overall  post bankruptcy  we estimate that we will recover approximately of the million of annualized rent that friendly s was paying the company before the bankruptcy filing 
additionally  in january  buffets holding  inc  or buffets  another one of our tenants  filed for voluntary reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
buffets leases properties from us that  as of december   represented approximately million  or approximately of our annualized rental revenue 
buffets rejected the leases on seven of our properties  representing approximately million of annualized rent 
additionally  we have reached a preliminary agreement subject to bankruptcy court approval with buffets regarding rent concessions and term reductions on some of buffets other leases with us 
overall  post bankruptcy  we estimate that we will recover approximately of the million of annualized rent that buffets was paying us before the bankruptcy filing 
friendly s and buffets both operate casual dining restaurants 
for both friendly s and buffets  any properties returned to us are immediately available for re lease to other tenants 
we believe that demand in the market for the rejected properties will allow us to find suitable replacement tenants within the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in finding replacement tenants for these properties within this timeframe  or at all  or that friendly s or buffets will continue to pay rent for the remainder of the lease terms on their accepted leases 
in addition  we have recently concluded an analysis of our portfolio and have identified other tenants  whose leases represented approximately to of our total annualized rent as of december   that we believe may make similar bankruptcy filings in however  the foregoing percentages are estimates and are subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties and the actual percentage of annualized rent represented by other tenants who make bankruptcy filings during may be different 
results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition 
we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business  as well as other factors  to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap  many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies 
one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties 
depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life  it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we believe that years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 
when acquiring a property for investment purposes  we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to land and building and improvements  based in each case on their estimated fair values 
in addition  any assumed mortgages payable are recorded at their estimated fair values 

table of contents for properties acquired with in place operating leases  we allocate the fair value of real estate to land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  based in each case on their estimated fair values 
intangible assets and liabilities consist of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  as applicable 
another significant judgment must be made as to if  and when  impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property 
key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates  estimated holding periods  capital expenditures  and property sales capitalization rates 
if a property is held for sale  it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value  less estimated cost to sell 
the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet 
our strategy of primarily holding properties  long term  directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable  thus requiring the recognition of an impairment 
however  if our strategy  or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future  an impairment may need to be recognized 
if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment  it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december   and rental revenue rental revenue was million for versus million for  an increase of million  or

percentage rent in was less than of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than of rental revenue in our portfolio of real estate  leased primarily to regional and national commercial enterprises under net leases  continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders 
at december   our portfolio of  properties was leased with properties available for lease as compared to at december  it has been our experience that approximately to of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time  however  it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million in versus million in and million in the increases in depreciation and amortization in and were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in and  which was partially offset by property sales in those same years

table of contents ebitda and adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures 
our ebitda and adjusted ebitda computation may not be comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda reported by other companies that interpret the definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do 
management believes ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be meaningful measures of a reit s performance because it is widely followed by industry analysts  lenders and investors and is used by management as one measure of performance 
in addition  management utilizes adjusted ebitda because our million credit facility uses a similar metric to measure our compliance with certain covenants 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should be considered along with  but not an alternative to  net income  cash flow and ffo  as measures of our operating performance

we consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company s ability to meet its interest expense obligations

in  we intend to employ more active disposition efforts to further enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio 
as a result  we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified  from which we anticipate receiving between million and million in proceeds during the next months 
we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions  if there are attractive opportunities available 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties

preferred stock dividends preferred stock cash dividends totaled million in  and net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders was million in  an increase of million as compared to million in net income available to common stockholders in was million 
the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties and excess land 
the amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders

table of contents we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments 
the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation of buildings and improvements  which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a reit  using historical accounting for depreciation  could be less informative 
the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure 
in addition  ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 
presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits  although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way  so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful 
furthermore  ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
in addition  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity  of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 
adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo affo for increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in and million in we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance 
most companies in our industry use a similar measurement  but they may use the term cad for cash available for distribution or fad for funds available for distribution 
the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and affo 
also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income available to common stockholders cumulative adjustments to calculate ffo ffo available to common stockholders amortization of share based compensation amortization of deferred financing costs provisions for impairment on real estate acquired for resale by crest capitalized leasing costs and commissions capitalized building improvements other adjustments total affo available to common stockholders affo per common share  basic and diluted distributions paid to common stockholders affo in excess of distributions paid to common stockholders weighted average number of common shares used for computation per share basic diluted see reconciling items for ffo presented under funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo 

table of contents includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our senior notes were issued in march  november  march  september  september  september  june and june additionally  this includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred and capitalized in connection with our assumption of the mortgages payable in these costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages 
no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 
includes straight line rent revenue and the amortization of above and below market leases 
we believe the non gaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies 
in particular  affo provides an additional measure by which to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to the measurement of the particular company s on going operating performance 
therefore  we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric  and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders 
presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits  although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way  so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful 
furthermore  ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
ffo and affo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
in addition  ffo and affo should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  of our ability to make cash distributions  or of our ability to pay interest payments 
impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes  increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings  and or fixed increases 
we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time 
during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent  as provided for in the leases  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 
of our  properties in our portfolio  approximately or  are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses 
net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and long term notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives we issue long term notes and bonds  primarily at fixed rates 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents the following table presents by year of expected maturity  the principal amounts  average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december  this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions expected maturity data year of maturity fixed rate debt average interest rate on fixed rate debt variable rate debt average interest rate on variable rate debt thereafter totals fair value million of fixed rate mortgages mature in for one million mortgage payable which matures in may  we have provided notice to the lender that we will be paying it off in march million of fixed rate senior notes mature in march and million of fixed rate mortgages mature in million of fixed rate mortgages mature in september and the credit facility expires in march million of fixed rate senior notes mature in november and million of variable rate mortgages mature in june the variable interest rate on the mortgages of million is capped at million of fixed rate senior notes mature in september as it relates to fixed rate senior notes  million matures in september  million matures in august  million matures in january and million matures in march excludes net premiums of  recorded on mortgages payable 
we base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate senior notes at december  on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our notes payable 
we base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate and variable rate mortgages at december  on the current year treasury yield curve  plus an applicable credit adjusted spread 
we believe that the carrying value of the credit facility balance reasonably approximates its estimated fair value at december the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates 
all of our outstanding senior notes and bonds have fixed interest rates 
all of our mortgages payable  except one  have fixed interest rates 
interest on our credit facility balance is variable 
based on our credit facility balance of million at december   a change in interest rates would change our interest costs by milliion per year 
as a result of the issuance of our class f preferred stock in february  we paid off all outstanding credit facility borrowings on february
