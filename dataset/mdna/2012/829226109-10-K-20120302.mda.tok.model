national revenues have decreased during  primarily due to declines in spending by the telecommunications  fast food  direct response  insurance companies  and reduced media spending by other forms of media 
production  selling and general and administrative expenses combined have increased over the same period primarily due to higher reverse network compensation and license fees  and freedom and four points lma payroll related costs in the fourth quarter 

table of contents events in january  we closed the asset acquisition of four points for million  and financed the acquisition with a million draw under a recently raised incremental term b loan commitment under our amended bank credit agreement plus a million cash escrow previously paid  and in february  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share 
industry trends political advertising increases in even numbered years  such as  due to the advertising expenditures from candidates running in local and national elections and issue related advertiser spending 
in addition  political revenue has consistently risen between presidential election or mid term election years such as from to or from to  respectively 
in every fourth year  such as  political advertising is usually elevated further due to presidential elections 
however  due to the contentious mid term elections our political revenues in not only exceeded results  but exceeded presidential election year revenues as well  the fcc has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi channel broadcasts 
the fcc must carry rules only apply to a station s primary digital stream  we  as well as a number of other broadcasters  have joined together in organizations such as the omvc  m and the mcv to focus on efforts to accelerate the nationwide availability of mobile dtv service and work through programming  distribution and aggregation opportunities 
there is potential for broadcasters to create an additional revenue stream by providing their signals to mobile devices as well as through other multi channel initiatives  retransmission consent rules provide a mechanism for broadcasters to seek payment from mvpds who carry broadcasters signals 
recognition of the value of the programming content provided by broadcasters  including local news and other programming and network programming all in hd has generated increased local revenues  automotive related advertising is a significant portion of our total net revenues in all periods presented and these revenues trended downward in most of due to the economic turmoil 
however  this sector has dramatically trended upward in and due to improved economic conditions  many other broadcasters are enhancing upgrading their websites to use the internet to deliver rich media content  such as newscasts and weather updates  to attract advertisers  seasonal advertising increases occur in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers  broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements  station outsourcing arrangements are becoming more common as broadcasters seek out ways to improve revenues and margins  advertising revenue related to the olympics occurs in even numbered years and the super bowl is aired on a different network each year 
both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues  and compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has halted 
networks now require compensation from broadcasters for the use of network programming 
sources of revenues and costs our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers 
since  we have been generating local revenues from our retransmission consent agreements with mvpds 
our revenues from local advertisers had seen a continued upward trend until and when non political revenues fell from due to the economic recession 
we saw an increase in local revenues in and revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of total broadcast revenues 
we believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues  combined with a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers multiple alternatives in which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasingly competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to our advertisers including the success of multi channel digital initiatives together with mobile dtv 
in addition  our revenue success is dependent on the success and advertising spending levels of the automotive industry 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  program contract costs  intangible assets  income taxes  property and equipment  investments and derivative contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets  intangible assets and equity and cost method investments 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  broadcast licenses  long lived assets  intangible assets and equity and cost method investments for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operating performance of our stations  legal factors and other various qualitative factors 
we have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires such assets along with our goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often when certain triggering events occur 
as of december   we had million of goodwill  million in broadcast licenses  and million in definite lived intangibles 
we perform our annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses at the beginning of the fourth quarter each year 
we early adopted the recent accounting guidance related to the annual goodwill impairment  which allowed us  beginning with our goodwill impairment test  to first qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that goodwill has been impaired 
as part of our qualitative assessment  we consider the following factors related to the reporting units  where applicable significant changes in the macroeconomic conditions  significant changes in the regulatory environment  significant changes in the operating model  management  products and services  customer base  cost structure and or margin trends  comparison of current and prior year operating performance and forecast trends for future operating performance  and the excess of the fair value over carrying value of the reporting units determined in prior quantitative assessments 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired  we will apply the quantitative two step method 
prior to  the annual impairment test for goodwill was performed using the quantitative two step method  for all reporting units 
for the annual impairment test for our indefinite lived intangibles  broadcast licenses  we also apply a quantitative assessment 
our quantitative assessments for our broadcast licenses and goodwill consist of estimating the fair market value of the broadcast licenses  or the fair value of our reporting units in the case of goodwill  using a combination of quoted market prices  observed earnings cash flow multiples paid for comparable television stations  discounted cash flow models and appraisals 
we then compare the estimated fair market value to the book value of these assets to determine if an impairment exists 
for the broadcast licenses  if the fair value is less than book value  we would record the resulting impairment 
for goodwill  if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  we then perform the second step which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill to determine the implied fair value 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
we aggregate our stations by market for purposes of our goodwill and license impairment testing and we believe that our markets are most representative of our broadcast reporting units because segment management views  manages and evaluates our stations on a market basis 
furthermore  in our markets operated as duopolies  certain costs of operating the stations are shared including the use of buildings and equipment  the sales force and administrative personnel 
our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within each designated marketing area  as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms length transaction 

table of contents for all other long lived assets  including fixed assets and definite lived intangibles  we assess recoverability of the assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we conclude that such trigger event has occurred  we perform a two step quantitative test to first assess whether the asset is recoverable by comparing the sum of undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to the carrying value of the asset group  including goodwill 
if the sum of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group  we then measure and allocate the amount of impairment to record for each of the assets in the asset group by comparing the respective fair value of the assets to their carrying values 
based on the qualitative assessment performed for the annual goodwill impairment test performed in  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of all reporting units would sufficiently exceed their carrying value and thus it was not necessary to perform the quantitative two step method 
the qualitative factors for our reporting units indicated stable or improving margins and favorable or stable forecasted economic conditions 
additionally  the results of prior quantitative assessments supported significant excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units 
based on quantitative assessments performed during the years ended december  and  we recorded impairment on our broadcast licenses and other long lived assets of million and million  respectively 
the million interim impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of was due to anticipated increase in construction costs for one of our stations as a result of converting to full power 
as a result of our annual impairment test for broadcast licenses in  we concluded that impairment did not exist 
the million impairment charge recorded in was primarily the result of additional cash outflows for increased signal strength necessary to maintain competitive market positions 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in impairment losses on our goodwill  broadcast licenses and other long lived assets 
of the million in impairment recorded in  we recorded million in the first quarter of we performed an interim impairment test in the first quarter of due to the severe economic downturn and continued decrease in our market capitalization 
accordingly  we made further revisions to our forecasted cash flows  cash flow multiples  and discount rates 
the impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter of was primarily due to the continued deterioration of the economy which resulted in further decreases in our forecasted cash flows and increases in our discount rates 
the fair value of our reporting units is calculated using a combination of the market approach using comparable market multiples and the income approach using a discounted cash flow model for four years and estimating the terminal value of the reporting units using a multiple of cash flows 
the fair value of our broadcast licenses is calculated using a discounted cash flow model for eight years and estimating the terminal value based on the constant growth model and a compound annual growth rate 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units to test our goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses consist of discount rates  revenue and expense growth rates  constant growth rates and comparable business multiples 
the revenue  expense and constant growth rates used in determining the fair value of our broadcast licenses have increased slightly from to the growth rates are based on market studies  industry knowledge and historical performance 
the discount rates used determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses did not significantly change from to the discount rate is based on a number of factors including market interest rates  a weighted average cost of capital analysis based on the target capital structure for a television station  and includes adjustments for market risk and company specific risk 
when factors indicate that there may be a decrease in value of an equity or cost method investment  we assess that investment and determine whether a loss in value has occurred 
if that loss is deemed to be other than temporary  an impairment loss is recorded 
for any investments that indicate a potential impairment  we estimate the fair value of those investments using discounted cash flow models  unrelated third party valuations or industry comparables  based on the various facts available to us 
during  we recorded million of impairment on equity method investments 
no impairment of our equity or cost method investments was recorded in and we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to evaluate whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was less than their carrying values  as well as with performing the quantitative impairment assessments discussed previously 
if future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  including future events such as a deterioration of market conditions or significant increases in discount rates  we could be exposed to impairment charges in the future 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
revenue recognition 
advertising revenues  net of agency commissions  are recognized in the period during which commercials are aired 
all other revenues are recognized as services are provided 
the revenues realized from station barter arrangements are recorded as the programs are aired at the estimated fair value of the advertising airtime given in exchange for the program rights 
some of our retransmission consent agreements contain both advertising and retransmission consent elements that are paid in cash 
we have determined that these agreements are revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
advertising and retransmission consent deliverables sold under our agreements are separated into different units of accounting based on fair value 
revenue applicable to the advertising element of the arrangement is recognized consistent with the advertising revenue policy noted above 
revenue applicable to the retransmission consent element of the arrangement is recognized over the life of the agreement 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from extending credit to our customers that are unable to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  a increase in the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   would increase bad debt expense by approximately million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
program contract costs 
we have agreements with distributors for the rights to televise programming over contract periods  which generally run from one to seven years 
contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period 
each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross cash contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing 
the portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in program contract assets and million and million  respectively  in program contract liabilities 
the programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value nrv 
estimated nrvs are based on management s expectation of future advertising revenue  net of sales commissions  to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms 
amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using a four year accelerated method or a straight line method  depending on the length of the contract 
program contract costs estimated by management to be amortized within one year are classified as current assets 
program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not reflected by adjustments for amortization or estimated nrv 
if our estimate of future advertising revenues declines  then additional write downs to nrv may be required 
income tax 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as of december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in deferred tax assets and million and million  respectively  in deferred tax liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine  based on the weight of all available evidence  that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   valuation allowances have been provided for a substantial amount of our available state net operating losses 
management periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions and accrues amounts for tax contingencies 
based on these reviews  the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations  accruals are adjusted as necessary in accordance with income tax accounting guidance 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended guidance with respect to goodwill impairment 
the amended guidance requires that step two of the goodwill impairment test be performed if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative and it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists based on any adverse qualitative factors including an evaluation of the triggering circumstances noted in the guidance 
the change is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued new guidance for fair value measurements 
the purpose of the new guidance is to have a consistent definition of fair value between us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
many of the amendments to gaap are not expected to have a significant impact on practice  however  the new guidance does require new and enhanced disclosure about fair value measurements 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively 
we do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements but may require changes to our fair value disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in the financial statements 
the new guidance does not make any changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income but rather allows an entity to choose whether to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
each component of net income and other comprehensive income along with their respective totals would need to be displayed under either alternative 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this guidance during the year ended december   which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued the final accounting standards update for goodwill impairment testing 
the standard allows an entity to first consider qualitative factors when deciding whether it is necessary to perform the current two step goodwill impairment test 
an entity would need to perform step one if it determines qualitatively that it is more likely than not that the fair 
table of contents value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the changes are effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this new guidance in the fourth quarter of in completing our annual impairment analysis 
this guidance impacted how we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing  however  it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as it did not result in any impairments for the fourth quarter of see note goodwill  broadcast licenses and other intangible assets for further discussion of the results of our goodwill impairment analysis

we have two reportable segments  broadcast and other operating divisions that are disclosed separately from our corporate activities 
seasonality cyclicality our operating results are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations 
usually  the second and fourth quarter operating results are higher than the first and third quarters because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers 
our operating results are usually subject to fluctuations from political advertising 
in even numbered years  political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections 
additionally  every four years  political spending is elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election
