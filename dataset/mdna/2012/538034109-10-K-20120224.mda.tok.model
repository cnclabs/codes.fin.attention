our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions  artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash  which depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is  to an extent  subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we cannot predict the impact to our ability to access additional capital in light of the current uncertainty in the credit market 
if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs  we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
in addition  the terms of our existing debt  including our senior secured credit facility  and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 
these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations 
we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all 
as a result  the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations 
any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 
the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that  in turn  could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 
the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends and make distributions  make certain investments  repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  modify the nature of our business  enter into sale leaseback transactions  transfer and sell material assets  and merge or consolidate 
in addition  our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions  including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios 
our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents  which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

table of contents these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 
furthermore  they may restrict our ability to expand  to pursue our business strategies and otherwise to conduct our business 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control  such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply 
a breach of these covenants could result in a default under our debt 
if there were an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness and the obligations thereunder accelerated  our assets and cash flow might not be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt and we could be forced into bankruptcy 
we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 
we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations 
if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us  we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries 
our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose 
in addition  the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries future indebtedness  as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 
any inability to fund the significant up front cash requirements associated with our touring and ticketing businesses could result in the loss of key tours or the inability to secure and retain ticketing clients 
in order to secure a tour  including global tours by major artists  we are often required to advance cash or post a letter of credit to the artist prior to the sale of any tickets for that tour 
additionally  to secure new  or retain existing  ticketing clients  we are often required by the client to make cash advances at the beginning and or periodically during the term of the agreement 
if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or capacity under our credit facility to advance the necessary cash or post the required letter of credit  for any given tour we would not be able to promote that tour and our touring business would be negatively impacted 
similarly  if we did not have enough cash on hand  or access to cash  required to advance to new ticketing clients or to continue to pay advances under existing ticketing agreements  our ticketing business would be negatively impacted 
risks relating to our convertible senior notes we may not have the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of the notes or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion if we make the net share settlement election  or we may otherwise be restricted from making such payments  which may increase note holders credit risk 
in july  we issued million of convertible senior notes due in a private placement in the united states to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
on july   july  and july   or in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes  holders may require us to repurchase their notes at a price of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  to the repurchase date 
in addition  at any time on or prior to june   we may irrevocably elect net share settlement of the notes  and thereafter we will be required to make a cash payment of up to  for each  in principal amount of notes converted 
however  it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds available at such time to make the required repurchase or settlement of converted notes 
in addition  some of our existing financing agreements contain  and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness could contain  provisions prohibiting the repurchase of the notes under certain circumstances  or could provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under that agreement  restrict our ability to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes or restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make funds available to us for that purpose 
if any agreement governing our indebtedness prohibits or otherwise restricts us from repurchasing the notes or making the cash payment upon conversion when we become obligated to do so  we could seek the consent of the lenders to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion or attempt to refinance the other debt 
if we do not obtain such consent or refinance the debt  we would not be permitted to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion without potentially causing a default under the other debt 
our failure to repurchase tendered notes or to pay any cash payable on a conversion would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness 

table of contents the additional shares of common stock payable on any notes converted in connection with specified corporate transactions may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transactions 
if certain specified corporate transactions occur on or prior to july   we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate on notes converted in connection with the specified corporate transaction by a number of additional shares of common stock 
the number of additional shares of common stock will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction 
the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes in connection with a specified corporate transaction may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transaction 
furthermore  holders of notes will not receive the additional consideration payable as a result of the increase in the conversion rate until the effective date of the specified corporate transaction or later  which could be a significant period of time after holders of notes have tendered their notes for conversion 
if the specified corporate transaction occurs after july   or if the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction is less than the common stock price at the date of issuance of the notes or above a specified price  there will be no increase in the conversion rate 
in addition  in certain circumstances upon a change of control arising from our acquisition by a public company  we may elect to adjust the conversion rate and  if we so elect  holders of notes will not be entitled to the increase in the conversion rate determined as described above 
the conditional conversion feature of the notes could result in holders of notes receiving less than the value of the common stock for which a note would otherwise be convertible 
prior to july   the notes are convertible for shares of our common stock or cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met 
if the specific conditions for conversion are not met  holders of notes will not be able to convert their notes  and they may not be able to receive the value of the common stock or cash and common stock  as applicable  for which the notes would otherwise be convertible 
upon conversion of the notes  holders of notes may receive less proceeds than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after the exercise of the conversion right 
if we elect to settle conversions other than solely in shares of common stock  including by making a net share settlement election  the conversion value that holders of notes will receive upon conversion of their notes are in part determined  subject to certain exceptions  by the average of the last reported sale prices of our common stock for the trading days beginning on the second trading day immediately following the day the notes are tendered for conversion  or  if tendered within the days leading up to the maturity date or a specified redemption date  beginning on the fifth day following the maturity date or the redemption date 
accordingly  if the price of our common stock decreases after holders of notes tender their notes for conversion  the conversion value they will receive may be adversely affected 
the conversion rate of the notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events 
the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment only for certain specified events  including  but not limited to  the issuance of stock dividends on our common stock  the issuance of certain rights or warrants  subdivisions  combinations  distributions of capital stock  indebtedness or assets  cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers 
however  the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events  such as an issuance of common stock for cash or acquisition  that may adversely affect the trading price of the notes or the common stock  or for a third party tender offer 

table of contents risks relating to our common stock we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade 
our stock price has fluctuated between and over the past three years 
the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  some of which may be beyond our control  including our quarterly or annual earnings  or those of other companies in our industry  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to the seasonality of our business and other factors related to our business  our loss of or inability to obtain significant popular artists or ticketing clients  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions or divestitures  the publication by securities analysts of financial estimates or reports about our business  changes by securities analysts of earnings estimates or reports  or our inability to meet those estimates or achieve any goals described in those reports  the disclosure of facts about our business that may differ from those assumed by securities analysts in preparing their estimates or reports about us  media reports  whether accurate or inaccurate  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies  overall market fluctuations  and general economic conditions 
in particular  the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  in the past  some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them 
if a suit were to be filed against us  regardless of the outcome  it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our corporate governance documents  rights agreement and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable  which could decrease the value of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors 
these provisions include restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors and supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents  a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent 
in addition  the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
delaware law  for instance  also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock and us 
although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that  subject to any written agreement to the contrary  which agreement does not currently exist  clear channel will have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers or vendors or employing or otherwise engaging or soliciting any of our officers  directors or employees 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if any director and or officer of the company who is also a director and or officer of clear channel acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate business opportunity a corporate opportunity for both us and clear channel  we will generally renounce our interest in the corporate opportunity 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunity that will belong to clear channel  unless such opportunity is offered to a director and or officer of the company in writing solely in such person s capacity as a director and or officer of the company 
we have obtained a waiver of this provision to the extent it might apply to irving azoff  who is our executive chairman and is also a member of clear channel s board of directors 
clear channel will  to the fullest extent permitted by law  have satisfied its fiduciary duty with respect to such a corporate opportunity and will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that it acquires or seeks the corporate opportunity for itself  directs that corporate opportunity to another person or does not present that corporate opportunity to us 
these provisions could make an acquisition of us less advantageous to a third party 

table of contents we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us 
under the plan  if any person or group acquires  or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring  or more of our common stock  and in the case of certain schedule g filers  or more of our common stock  and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates  more than of our common stock  without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances  our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock  or shares of the acquiring company  at a substantial discount to the public market price 
therefore  the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 
in addition  the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control 
these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock  which could affect its market price 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth  development and expansion of our business and or to repay existing indebtedness 
accordingly  we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the declaration  payment and amount of future dividends  if any  will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow from operations  current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans  the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law 
in addition  the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders 
accordingly  holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 
future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 
we have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 
as of december   there were million shares of live nation common stock outstanding including million shares of unvested restricted stock awards and excluding million shares held in treasury  million shares issuable from unvested restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards  million shares of common stock issuable from options currently exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per share  million shares issuable from the conversion of our convertible notes and a warrant to purchase million shares of common stock at an exercise price of we continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy 
these acquisitions may involve the payment of cash  the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities 
any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time 
the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock 
the hedging or arbitrage could  in turn  affect the trading prices of our convertible notes 
conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 
the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue blank check preferred stock  the designation  number  voting powers  preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors 
our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock 
accordingly  the board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock 

table of contents risks relating to the separation if the separation were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax free for united states federal income tax purposes  we may be subject to significant tax liabilities 
in connection with the separation  clear channel received both a private letter ruling from the irs and a legal opinion substantially to the effect that the distribution of our common stock to its stockholders qualified as a tax free distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections and a d of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and the opinion of counsel  the irs could assert that the separation did not qualify for tax free treatment for united states federal income tax purposes 
if the irs were successful in taking this position  clear channel could be subject to a significant united states federal income tax liability 
in general  clear channel would be subject to tax as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value 
in addition  even if the separation otherwise were to qualify under section of the code  it may be taxable to clear channel as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value under section e of the code  if the separation were later deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a or greater interest in clear channel or us 
for this purpose  any acquisitions of clear channel stock or of our stock within the period beginning two years before the separation and ending two years after  are presumed to be part of such a plan  although we or clear channel may be able to rebut that presumption 
although such corporate level taxes  if any  resulting from a taxable distribution generally would be imposed on clear channel  we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel and its affiliates against tax related liabilities  if any  caused by the failure of the separation to qualify as a tax free transaction under section of the code including as a result of section e of the code if the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions  events or transactions relating to our stock  assets or business  or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement 
if the failure of the separation to qualify under section of the code is for any reason for which neither we nor clear channel is responsible  we and clear channel have agreed in the tax matters agreement that we will each be responsible for of the tax related liabilities arising from the failure to so qualify 
clear channel reported a billion capital loss as a result of the separation
