business overview and presentation advanced energy experienced significant changes in the markets it serves in after an exceptional year in  began with the same level of growth and opportunities 
as the year progressed  the markets served by our thin films business unit began to experience a significant slow down due to uncertain economic conditions 
we demonstrated speed and flexibility in responding to the changing needs of our markets and began strategic initiatives to re align our business to move the research and development and engineering functions closer to our customers 
these actions will reduce our time to market for new product development 
the acquisition of pv powered in may expanded our solar energy business and positioned us among the leaders in the north american solar inverter market 
solar inverter sales grew to million in  significant growth over critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note operations and summary of significant accounting 
table of contents policies and estimates to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting positions described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting positions require significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on variability in factors affecting these statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales upon transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and the collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
in most transactions  we have no obligations to our customers after the date products are shipped  other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
for customers purchasing our solar energy products  we provide installation  support  and services after the product has been shipped 
for arrangements containing these additional elements  we allocate revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence of the selling price of each individual element of the arrangement 
as we also sell these additional elements separately  the evidence is our selling price for those elements when sold separately 
we defer the revenue of any undelivered elements until the undelivered element is delivered 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers  if any  are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales 
we maintain a credit approval process and we make significant judgments in connection with assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
the customers purchasing our solar energy products require larger credit limits than those purchasing our thin film products 
despite this assessment  from time to time  our customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
we continuously monitor our customers credit worthiness  and use our judgment in establishing a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivable and our future operating results 
additionally  if our credit loss rates prove to be greater than we currently estimate  we could record additional reserves for doubtful accounts 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost  based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our industry is subject to technological change  new product development  and product technological obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments in excess of our current estimates could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
warranty costs we provide for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue 
we offer warranty coverage for a majority of our thin film products for periods typically ranging from to months after shipment 
we warrant our solar inverter products for five to ten years and provide the option to purchase additional warranty coverage up to years 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing our products under such warranties based on the historical costs of the repairs and any known specific product issues 
the assumptions we use to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically  in light of actual experience  and when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
should product failure rates differ from our estimates  actual costs could vary significantly from our expectations 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets we completed our acquisition of pv powered in may for a total cost of million 
as a result of our acquisition  we recorded intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing  as well as  testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu intangibles goodwill and other which allows an assessment of qualitative factors in determining if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired 
if this assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired the next step of impairment testing compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
goodwill would be impaired if the resulting implied fair value of goodwill was less than the recorded carrying value of the goodwill 
we adopted the new guidance related to goodwill impairment testing in and therefore performed an assessment of qualitative factors for our annual impairment test in  including macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  cost factors  and overall financial performance of our solar inverter business 
this assessment resulted in the conclusion that there is no impairment of goodwill 

table of contents finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we use the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows and other fair value measurements 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon our estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows are significantly diminished  intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
additionally  the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to our carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to our results of operations 
income taxes we assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
our assessment includes a number of factors  including historical results and taxable income projections for each jurisdiction 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the generation of taxable income in appropriate jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
we consider our scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance 
accounting for income taxes requires a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate our tax position by determining if  based on the technical merits  it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained upon audit  including resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
although we believe our tax estimates and reserves  including those for uncertain tax positions  are reasonable  including those relied upon in the execution of our entity restructuring  if those estimates and judgments prove to be incorrect  we could record further adjustments to our tax provisions and accruals  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
business environment and trends semiconductors investment in semiconductor capital equipment spending increased overall worldwide for the second straight year  although at a growth rate lower than after a surge of capital investment going into  fab utilization rates declined in the second half of the year while integrated circuit inventories rose  forcing many semiconductor manufacturers to reduce inventory levels in the second half 
consumer spending picked up to some extent during the fourth quarter holiday season  but not enough to lower the level of inventory of electronic devices that use semiconductors 
emerging players in the korean wafer fab equipment market continued to gain momentum and capture market share in plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition pecvd and etch technologies for dynamic random access memory dram  and are increasing the level of competition around price  performance and responsiveness 
we believe we are well positioned in this region as our local presence grows  and as we deepen relationships with the evolving korean customer base 
looking forward  we anticipate global macroeconomic trends to somewhat offset expected improvements in consumer electronics demand as we move through the first half of as inventory levels continue to decrease  we expect modest gains in demand for semiconductor capital equipment toward the second half of flat panel display growth in our flat panel display fpd market is driven by investment in new technologies  particularly in the development of next generation high definition televisions  smart phones and tablet computers 
the majority of fpd investment was centered on mass production of active matrix light emitting diode displays amoled at generation and higher generation liquid crystal display lcd panels at generation and above 
early equipment investment paused in the second half of the year as manufacturers began to work through their inventory and focus on the migration to amoled 
overall  we expect flat panel display sales to remain slow throughout most of as customers continue to work through inventory and continue the migration to amoled 

table of contents we believe we are well positioned to benefit from growth in etch and pvd where we hold strong technology and market positions 
similar to the semiconductor market  new korean equipment suppliers are emerging and capturing market share in fpd 
our continued investment in localized korean manufacturing and expanded capabilities brings us closer to our customers and enhances our responsiveness to their evolving needs 
thin film renewables strong demand for our crystalline silicon c si pv products in europe and china drove initial strength in renewables sales early in however  the unexpected and sudden decline in pv module prices negatively impacted thin films renewables sales for most of solar subsidy cuts in germany and italy early in the year triggered a global oversupply of solar panels and the ensuing price declines 
as a result of this oversupply and uncertain demand in the major european markets  wafer  cell and module production capacity is likely not to expand until the second half of at the earliest 
many of the largest suppliers of pv products along with smaller chinese solar companies will most likely run their plants below capacity while some may stop production completely 
this scenario will have an adverse impact on our sales in this market for the foreseeable future 
thin film solar manufacturing  including copper indium gallium selenide cigs and cadmium telluride cdte  will continue to increase capacity as the technology matures  keeping the relative market share of thin film to c si constant for the foreseeable future 
our power conversion technology for sputtering are well positioned in these markets and will benefit from increased demand as customers require more control and repeatability in their deposition processes due to capacity increases 
inverter we believe the long term impact of declining pv module prices will be an increase in solar projects as the overall cost for a solar installation falls and the financial model for power producers gets more attractive 
however  the short term impact experienced in was postponement and or delays of projects in an effort by customers to secure the lowest price modules available 
advances in inverter technology  such as higher efficiency and intelligent grid support  will take on a greater significance in and beyond  particularly for multi megawatt projects in the utility industry 
this technology development will be critical in order for projects to be financial viable given the anticipated cuts in global solar incentives 
additionally  global demand has expanded from europe to growth markets in north america and asia and  as a result  has and will continue to drive increased global competition 
results of operations our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be instructive for understanding our historical performance and relevant trends going forward 
our results of operations include the operating results of pv powered for the full year ended december  and the period may  through december  operating results applicable to our gas flow control business are excluded from our results of continuing operations for all periods presented 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  in item of this annual report on form k 
segment reporting in fiscal the combination of pv powered s solar inverter product line with our solaron inverter product line resulted in revenue growth  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our overall revenue 
serving the inverter market has proven to require management  marketing  sales and engineering efforts that are uniquely different from those of our traditional thin film capital equipment market 
as a result  management announced the creation of two focused business units within the company effective january  the two business units  thin films deposition power conversion and thermal instrumentation thin films and solar energy  enable improved execution and a strategic focus on their distinct markets 
the thin films business unit principally serves our oem and end customers in the semiconductor  flat panel display  solar panel  and other capital equipment markets  while the solar energy business unit focuses on residential  commercial  and utility scale solar projects and installations  selling primarily to distributors  engineering  procurement  and construction contractors epc s  developers  and utility companies 
the creation of these two units enables greater focus on each business unique needs and requirements  allowing each to expand and accelerate our growth by better serving each of these very different industries 

table of contents due to the structure of our internal organization  the design of our internal systems  and the manner in which expenses were tracked and managed  we are unable to recast our financial statements by operating segment for and prior without significant cost and effort 
therefore  except for revenue  segment information based on the two new business units for and has not been reported as it is impracticable to do so

in thousands thin films semiconductor capital equipment market non semiconductor capital equipment global support total thin films solar energy total sales 
table of contents years ended december  thin films semiconductor capital equipment market non semiconductor capital equipment global suppoirt total thin films solar energy total sales total sales total sales for the twelve months ended december  increased to million from million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in sales was driven by a significant increase in inverter sales by our solar energy business unit 
the increase in inverter sales in was due to growth in overall demand in north america for commercial and utility scale solar applications 
the increase in solar energy was partially offset by a slight decline in sales of our thin films business unit caused by a slowdown in demand in all of our end markets  particularly in the second half of the year 
this slowdown was the direct result of uncertainty in the global economy  caused by lower consumer spending on products such as desktop computers  laptops  and high definition flat panel televisions 
total sales increased to million in as compared to the increase in sales was driven by a recovery in all of the thin film end markets that we serve from very depressed levels in caused by a global recession 
additionally  we experienced significant levels of customer adoption of our utility scale inverter products in and acquired pv powered  which contributed an additional million in inverter sales from the acquisition date of may  through the end of the year 
thin films results for thin films for the twelve months ended december    and are as follows in thousands years ended december  sales operating income total thin film sales for declined as compared to as a result of weakening economic conditions across all of our thin film markets in the second half of the year 
this uncertainty has tempered demand for consumer electronics  which drives capital spending throughout the markets we serve 
total thin film sales increased in as compared to this increase was the result of an economic recovery in that was marked by growing consumer confidence and spending and high levels of capital investment by our oem customers and their end users to meet consumer demand 
in  sales in our thin film semiconductor market decreased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales in the first half of the year saw a continuation of the growth experienced in as a transition from dram to flash memory brought on continued investment in new products and capacity in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
however  the second half of was marked by uncertain economic conditions that began to have a negative impact on capacity utilization and investment in capital equipment among our customers end users 
we anticipate this uncertainty will continue into the first half of  but may recover towards the second half of the year 
in  semiconductor market sales rose to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales in the increase was due to a recovery from extremely low investment levels in that saw capacity at record lows in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
demand from our customers end users grew as they rebuilt capacity throughout the year  made investments in new technology and rebuilt inventory to satisfy the consumer electronics market 

table of contents sales to the non semiconductor capital equipment markets remained flat in as compared to the markets that comprise our non semiconductor capital equipment markets include flat panel display  solar panel  data storage  architectural glass  and other industrial thin film manufacturing equipment markets 
our customers in these markets are predominantly large oems 
although our customers in the non semiconductor capital equipment markets were also adversely impacted by negativity in consumer sentiment  lower capital spending  and lower factory utilization rates  the extent and timing of the impact was slightly different in each end market 
sales to customers in the flat panel display market increased to million  or of total sales in as compared to million  or of total sales in while revenue year over year was relatively flat  we experienced a large increase in demand in the early part of that was the continuation of an investment cycle that began in this investment for capacity expansion in both korea and the prc came online in the second half of the year and resulted in very low levels of investment during the remainder of the year and  most likely  will continue into the first half of sales to customers in the solar panel market decreased to million  or of total sales in as compared to million  or of total sales in we experienced a very robust first half of due to the continuation of a heavy capital investment cycle in the solar panel market  however  that heavy investment resulted in an ensuing overcapacity that ended virtually all investment in the latter half of the year and  most likely  into due to this overcapacity  panel prices have been declining over the past several quarters and we will need to wait out a market pause as our customers end users postpone investment in new technology and wait for the consolidation and or reduction of panel inventors around the world and the stabilization of panel prices 
in  total sales to the non semiconductor capital equipment markets increased to million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in the increase in non semiconductor sales in was due to capacity expansion in the flat panel display market and capacity expansion in the solar panel market 
in  sales to customers in the flat panel display market increased to million  or of total sales in as compared to million  or of total sales  in this increase was the result of a significant cycle of investing by panel manufacturers in korea and the prc which was driven by the market adoption of flat panels by chinese consumers  the growth in touch screens for tablet computers and smart phones  and the migration of new technology such as led backlighting and d televisions around the world 
in  sales to customers in the solar panel market increased to million  or of total sales  in as compared to million  or of total sales  in throughout  we saw strong demand for our crystalline silicon pv products in both europe and the prc 
additionally  the north american market grew in as larger megawatt output solar array projects resulted in an increase in the demand for solar panels 
global support revenue for increased to million  or of total sales in as compared to million  or of total sales in service activity levels were stable in most of our geographic regions and end markets as changes due to tighter maintenance budgets were offset by sales of used equipment 
the outlook for our global support business continues to be strong  the risk of our end users more tightly managing maintenance budgets in response to drops in factory utilization should be offset by the expansion of our product offerings in the growing solar array service market 
in  global support revenue grew to million  or of total sales  compared to million  or of sales  in the increase in global support sales in was due to an increase in factory utilization by our customers throughout the year  which drove demand for repairs  replacement parts  and inventory restocking 
additionally  as factory utilization remained high  our customers looked to us to provide them with used and refurbished equipment to be used as spares for their fabrication lines 
applied materials inc  our largest customer  accounted for million or of our sales in  million  or of our sales in  and million  or  of our sales in our sales to applied materials included sales for the semiconductor capital equipment market  as well as the solar and flat panel display markets 

table of contents solar energy results for solar energy for the twelve months ended december    and are as follows in thousands years ended december  sales operating income solar energy sales increased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in solar energy comprised of total sales in as compared to in sales in also included a full year of sales from pv powered which we acquired on may  the majority of our sales in the inverter market continued to come from commercial and utility scale applications 
the addition of pv powered s product portfolio expanded the range of power capacities in which we can compete and added a line of residential inverters 
the increase in sales in as compared to was the result of growth in overall demand in north america for commercial and utility scale solar applications 
we anticipate that inverter sales will increase in due to continued investment by utilities and municipalities in solar applications in north america 
however  our revenue in the first quarter of will be down due to normal seasonal delays typically experienced in cold weather states 
we are also cautious about delays and pushouts of business in response to the continued uncertainty around solar energy incentives and dropping prices for solar panels 
although we expect lower solar panel prices to ultimately fuel growth of solar array installations  uncertainty regarding pricing may continue to cause temporary delays in the procurement of equipment needed for projects 
sales to the solar inverter market grew  to million  or of total sales  in  as compared to million  or of total sales  in along with the widespread adoption of our solaron inverter product in north america and europe  this increase was also driven by our acquisition of pv powered on may  gross profit our gross profit was million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in the increase in absolute dollars is due to the overall growth in production and sales in  a full year of sales from our acquisition of pv powered and increased leverage of factory overhead  as well as  reduced warranty costs resulting from improved quality and lower warranty claims 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales is the result of a shift in the mix of products including a higher percentage of revenue from our solar energy product line  which traditionally has lower gross margins 
gross profit was million  or of revenue in and million  or of revenue  in the large increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in when compared to was due to an overall boost in production volume and increased leverage from factory overhead  plus reduced warranty costs as a percent of total sales resulting from lower warranty claims 
operating expense the following table summarizes our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended  and years ended december  in thousands research and development selling  general  and administrative impairment of goodwill amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses 
table of contents operating expenses increased in due to the purchase of pv powered in and increased spending in our production facilities in carried over into the first half of demand in the markets we serve declined significantly in the second half of as a result  we initiated a plan to re align our business to be closer to our customers and improve our time to market 
these initiatives included headcount reductions  facilities closures  and asset impairments 
the first phase of these initiatives occurred late in the year  therefore the reductions in spending were not fully realized in but are expected to save approximately million annually 
the second phase of the initiatives will occur over the next to months 
once complete  the two phases of the plan are expected to result in annual savings in excess of million 
in response to the extremely unfavorable global economic and industry conditions  we implemented cost reductions in some of the cost reductions were business restructuring  which were permanent in nature 
these included reductions of personnel headcounts across all functions and geographies and consolidation of facilities on a worldwide basis 
additionally  we implemented cost cutting initiatives that were more temporary in nature  such as cuts in discretionary spending  including travel expense and professional fees  as well as  pay cuts for management level personnel  company wide shutdowns and reductions in employee benefits 
in order to meet the current level of demand  as well as  implement strategic projects that drive continued international growth and sales opportunities  we increased headcount in and  as a result  incurred more discretionary spending in than in the rapid increase in demand in in the markets we serve has challenged our production capacity  as well as  our ability to meet the tight deadlines of our customers 
as a result  we increased spending in our production facilities in order to meet our customers demands and take full advantage of the market opportunities presented to us in additionally  we added employees and operating expenses related to the acquisition of pv powered  as well as  for the infrastructure necessary to expand our global presence to new markets throughout the world 
research and development the markets we serve constantly present opportunities to develop products for new or emerging applications and require technological changes driving for higher performance  lower cost  and other attributes that will advance our customers products 
we believe that continued and timely development of new and differentiated products  as well as enhancements to existing products to support customer requirements  are critical for us to compete in the markets we serve 
accordingly  we devote significant personnel and financial resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and we expect these investments to continue 
all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  increased million from the same period in the increase is primarily the result of a full year of expenses for pv powered 
we continued to invest in product development in both the thin film and solar energy businesses to meet customer needs 
the strategic initiatives announced in september involved re aligning our research and development activities to be closer to our customers 
these initiatives included headcount reductions which will reduce future research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses of million in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in was driven primarily by slight increases in personnel costs  including the reversal of the temporary cost control efforts implemented in and  outside consulting  and travel 
additionally  this variance includes increased spending as a result of the engineering personnel absorbed in the pv powered acquisition 
selling  general and administrative our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  third party sales representative commissions  and other selling and marketing activities 
our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate  legal  tax  financial  governance  administrative  information systems  and human resource functions in addition to our general management 
selling general and administrative sg a expenses increased million in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to a full year of expenses for employees added through the acquisition of pv powered combined with an increase in bad debt expense  which was partially offset by significantly lower incentive expenses in based on a decline in company performance in the second half of the year 
the increase in sg a expenses of million in as compared to was primarily driven by increases in sales personnel  commissions  and travel expenses to meet the expectations and demands of our global customers  increased personnel costs related to the reversal of the temporary cost control efforts described earlier in this section  and the accrual of incentive compensation totaling million during as compared to no incentive compensation expense in we incurred million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of pv powered during  as well as  additional costs related to employees added through the acquisition 

table of contents goodwill impairment we perform a goodwill impairment analysis annually as of october  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in september  the fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other which allows an assessment of qualitative factors in determining if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired 
if this assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired the next step of impairment testing compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
goodwill would be impaired if the resulting implied fair value of goodwill was less than the recorded carrying value of the goodwill 
we adopted the new guidance for our annual impairment test in as allowed by the asu  and therefore  performed an assessment of qualitative factors for our annual impairment test in resulting in the conclusion that there is no impairment of goodwill 
the qualitative factors used in our assessment include macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  cost factors  and overall financial performance of our solar inverter business 
based upon a combination of factors in early  including a significant decline in our market capitalization below our carrying value  the deteriorating macro economic environment  which had resulted in a significant decline in customer demand  and illiquidity in the overall credit markets  we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis at february  we determined our fair market value at february  based on our market capitalization and an average weighting of both projected discounted future cash flows and the use of comparative market multiples and relative control premiums 
the use of comparative market multiples the market approach uses other comparable companies valuation multiples to arrive at a fair value 
the use of discounted cash flows was based on assumptions that were consistent with our estimates of future growth and our strategic plan to manage the underlying business  and also included a probability weighted expectation as to our future cash flows 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  and tax rates  along with other considerations 
having determined that our goodwill was potentially impaired  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis which involved allocating the overall estimated fair value of the company to all of our assets and liabilities other than goodwill including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets and comparing the residual amount to the carrying value of goodwill 
in march  we determined that our goodwill was fully impaired and recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million 
this charge eliminated the goodwill balance as of december  all goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  resulted from the acquisition of pv powered 
amortization expense amortization expense was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period ending december  and million for the same period ending december  the increase of million in is due to a full year of amortization as compared to a partial year in on million of amortizable assets acquired with the purchase of pv powered 
amortization expense in included expense for the period may  through december  see note intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on intangible assets and related future amortization 
restructuring charges in september  we announced several initiatives designed to realign our manufacturing and research and development activities in order to foster growth and enhance profitability 
these initiatives are designed to align research and development activities with the location of our customers and reduce product costs for the solar energy business 
as part of this plan  we have reduced the global workforce by approximately people or of the workforce  begun consolidation of our facilities by terminating a lease of office and research and development space  and recording impairments for assets no longer in use due to the restructuring of our business 
these activities resulted in million of charges in over the next to months  we will continue to evaluate our cost structure as we close facilities and relocate certain functions 
we estimate these initiatives will result in additional charges of approximately million to million 
during and we implemented cost reduction efforts in response to deteriorating economic conditions and weakening demand from our end markets 
as a result  we incurred restructuring costs of million in the costs incurred were primarily severance and benefits related to reductions in personnel 
we did not incur any restructuring costs in we continue to look for ways to make our global workforce more efficient and effective  which may lead to additional cost reduction activities in the future 

table of contents other income other income consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses  and other miscellaneous items 
interest income for the twelve month periods ending december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the consistent decrease was the result of much lower interest rates available in financial markets in and as compared to other income  net was million in  million in and a million loss in the decrease in as compared to was mainly due to million in net revenue recognized in from pv powered s participation in the solar energy grid system program sponsored by the department of energy 
the revenue related to this program declined in as the project in process was completed 
provision for income taxes we recorded a income tax provision of million which consisted of million of us federal and state income taxes and million of foreign jurisdiction tax benefit 
the shift in tax expense between domestic and foreign  as compared to  was the result of profitability in our solar energy business unit  which is primarily domestic  and foreign losses related to start up expenses and loss true ups in certain jurisdictions 
during  we were profitable in most of the jurisdictions in which we operated 
as a result  we accrued income taxes at statutory rates that vary by location 
we recorded an income tax provision of million during the year ended december  the income tax provision consisted of million of tax on income in foreign jurisdictions and million of us federal and state income taxes 
we recorded a income tax provision of million consisting of million foreign taxes  million of federal income tax  and million benefit for state income taxes 
the us federal income tax expense consisted of million of tax expense related to reserves for uncertain tax positions  offset by million of federal income tax benefit 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof  and the geographic composition of our pre tax income 
we carefully monitor these factors and adjust our effective income tax rate accordingly 
discontinued operations on october   we completed the sale of our gas flow control business  which includes the aera mass flow control and related product lines to hitachi metals  ltd  for million 
assets and liabilities sold include  without limitation  inventory  real property in hachioji  japan  equipment  certain contracts  intellectual property rights related to the gas flow control business  and certain warranty liability obligations 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million gain on the asset disposition  net of million in taxes 
the results of continuing operations were reduced by the revenue and costs associated with the gas flow control business which are included in the income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information

sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our ability to fund our operations  acquisitions  capital expenditures  and product development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to future operating performance  as well as  general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other conditions  some of which may be beyond our control

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and risk management in the normal course of business  we have exposures to interest rate risk from our investments and foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations and foreign currency transactions 
interest rate risk our market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments consisted primarily of treasury bills  certificates of deposit  corporate bonds  agency bonds and institutional money markets  all with maturity of less than years 
as a measurement of the sensitivity of our portfolio and assuming that our investment portfolio balances remain constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in interest rates would decrease annual pre tax earnings by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates through sales and purchasing transactions when we sell products and purchase materials in currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred 
the functional currencies of our worldwide facilities primarily include the usd  eur  krw  twd  gbp  and cny 
our purchasing and sales activities are primarily denominated in the usd  eur and cny 
we may be impacted by changes in the relative buying power of our customers  which may impact sales volumes either positively or negatively 
as these currencies fluctuate against each other  and other currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on sales  purchasing transactions and labor 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange rate contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities expected to be settled at a future date 
market risk arises from the potential adverse effects on the value of derivative instruments that result from a change in foreign currency exchange rates 
in we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the exchange rate risk associated with intercompany debt denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
we minimize our market risk applicable to foreign currency exchange rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of our derivative contract instruments 
we enter into derivative contract instruments for risk management purposes only 
we do not enter into or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
our reported financial results of operations  including the reported value of our assets and liabilities  are also impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
assets and liabilities of substantially all of our subsidiaries outside the us are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period 
operating results and cash flow statements are translated at weighted average rates of exchange during each reporting period 
although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact  the translation changes may impact future borrowing capacity  and overall value of our net assets 
currency exchange rates vary daily and often one currency strengthens against the usd while another currency 
table of contents weakens 
because of the complex interrelationship of the worldwide supply chains and distribution channels  it is difficult to quantify the impact of a change in one or more particular exchange rates
