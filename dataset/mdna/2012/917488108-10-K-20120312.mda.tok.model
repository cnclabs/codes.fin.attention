item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations currency amounts are in thousands except per share amounts and where noted 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
overview on march   utmd acquired femcare see note 
the performance of femcare after march  is included in financial results 
a summary of income statement measures for compared to follows change net sales gross profit operating income income before tax net income earnings per share a comparison of profit margins in to follows gross profit margin operating income margin net income margin the acquisition of femcare group ltd in march was substantially accretive to utmd s financial performance in  highlighted by a increase in consolidated sales and a increase in earnings per share eps 
the company s continued excellent profitability allowed it to pay down the five year term loans that it incurred to finance the purchase of femcare faster than required  while retaining utmd s program of dividend payments to its shareholders 
in addition to the obvious benefit of a much greater sales volume to absorb the overhead costs of its critical infrastructure  a significant benefit of the femcare acquisition for utmd was the geographic diversification of sales 
in  sales to entities outside the us comprised of total sales compared to in sales to customers outside the us were  in compared to  in  a increase 
in  utmd had foreign distributors purchase more than during the year compared to in in addition to the greater number of overseas sales distribution entities  utmd expects to be able to better cross utilize distributors previously representing one or the other of femcare or utmd  but this integration project continues somewhat slowly as distributors evaluate and learn about the other specialized product lines relative to their individual market needs  and utmd adjusts its distribution agreements 
utmd believes that international sales will continue to lead its growth in notwithstanding  there are a number of significant risk factors that could negatively impact utmd s international sales  including those listed above under risk factors 
with regard to utmd s four product categories  sales in its lowest category in became its highest category in in  neonatal product  blood pressure monitoring and accessories  labor delivery devices and gynecology urology product sales were   and of total sales  respectively 
in  neonatal product  blood pressure monitoring and accessories  labor delivery devices and gynecology urology product sales were   and of total sales  respectively 
simply stated  with the acquisition of femcare  utmd is now much more a gynecology medical device company 
the company s new product development activities will reflect that change in emphasis 
prior to its acquisition by utmd  except for the assembly and servicing of reusable filshie clip applicators and some packaging operations  femcare subcontracted its manufacturing to third parties 
going forward  utmd expects to realize an important  if subtle  benefit from its own manufacturing quality and cost disciplines for certain femcare devices 
in particular  utmd will be able to employ its utah molding capabilities and ireland assembly and packaging operations 
despite rapid increases in raw materials costs and steady increases in unit labor costs in  utmd s gross profit margin gpm  gross profits divided by sales  was percentage points higher in than in the improvement was due to the combination of the cost savings from consolidating utmd s oregon molding operations into utah  improved manufacturing overhead and direct labor efficiencies  a different product mix  and direct sales in the uk and australia for femcare devices at end user prices instead of distributor wholesale prices 
despite the higher gpm  operating income margins oim were about four percentage points lower than in due to the amortization of intangible assets that resulted from the femcare acquisition  acquisition expenses  and higher femcare operating expenses as a percentage of sales 
despite a lower oim  operating profits increased  in the femcare acquisition transaction costs of were included in g a expenses  of which were not tax deductible 
utmd expects that it will be able to improve its oim in as a result of reducing redundant g a expenses after the acquisition 
income before taxes ebt increased  in ebt was diminished by much higher interest expense from borrowing to help finance the femcare acquisition interest in compared to in utmd expects that its non operating expense will be substantially less in than in due to reducing debt rapidly as a result of its positive cash flow 
net income income after provision for income taxes was  higher in  a increase 
utmd s net income margin nim  net income as percent of sales  was down about four percentage points due to the lower oim and interest expense related to the femcare acquisition 
the effective consolidated income tax provision rate for was compared to in the lower rate in was primarily a result of the lower income tax rate in the uk and australia compared to the us for the portion of consolidated income generated in the uk and australia  respectively 
with a full year of femcare ebt in the uk and australia  combined with another lowering of the uk tax rate to as of april   and the lack of recurrence of non deductible acquisition expenses  utmd expects its consolidated income tax provision rate will again be lower in earnings per share eps of were 
higher  or higher  than in net income and earnings per share in will be further leveraged due to lower interest expense and a lower average income tax provision rate 
management is currently projecting eps for calendar year in the range of to  an increase in the range of 
in summary  management is currently targeting growth in revenues and gross profits in  and growth in operating income  ebt  net income and eps 
the company s december  balance sheet changed substantially from december  due to the march femcare acquisition 
key december  balance sheet changes compared to december  and post acquisition march  follow december  balance sheet change from cash investments receivables inventory property and equipment net goodwill other intangible assets net total assets current portion of notes payable notes payable deferred tax liability intangibles total liabilities shareholders equity measures of the company s liquidity and overall financial condition in also changed significantly as a result of the femcare acquisition and the loans utmd obtained to partially finance the transaction 
for example  utmd s current ratio current assets to current liabilities decreased to at the end of from a year earlier  and the total debt ratio total liabilities to total assets increased to from at the end of however  the additional debt allowed significant improvements in sales and income 
cash generation remained strong enough to increase quarterly cash dividend payout rate to shareholders while at the same time rapidly paying down the loan principal balances 
ending days in accounts receivable improved to from average inventory balances increased less than sales  yielding higher inventory turns 
the return on average shareholders equity prior to the payment of dividends increased to in compared to for productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year end total assets were  compared to  at the end of the increase was primarily due to the addition of about million in femcare net intangible assets  offset by a decrease in cash and investments of about million 
the two components of femcare intangibles at year end were identifiable intangibles of  reduced from  by amortization of  and goodwill of  the productivity of total assets average total asset turns total sales divided by average total assets for the year in was compared to in year end and cash and investment balances were  and  representing and of total assets  respectively 
the reduction in cash was due to utmd s investment in femcare 
although management expects sales to increase by about  average total asset turns in will decline because the average of total assets will be substantially higher with a full year of the intangible assets acquired during on utmd s balance sheet during property  plant and equipment pp e assets are comprised of utah  ireland and england manufacturing molds  production tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software  and facilities 
ending net consolidated pp e depreciated book value of all fixed assets increased as a result of in depreciation  the addition of in femcare pp e in march  capital expenditures of and the year end effect of usd currency exchange rates on the value of pp e in england and ireland 
the net book value of pp e in the us decreased during  and in ireland decreased femcare s ending net book value of pp e was after depreciation of and in capital expenditures 
average pp e turns sales divided by net pp e increased about because  with the acquisition of femcare  sales increased and year end net pp e increased only 
in contrast to utmd  femcare leases its facilities and subcontracts most of its manufacturing 
the year end net book value after accumulated depreciation of consolidated pp e was of actual acquisition cost 
since utmd s pp e is in good working order and capable of supporting increased sales activity  the continued productivity of fixed assets will remain a source of future profitability 
in  the utah facility was expanded to house the transfer of equipment from consolidation of oregon operations 
in  new pp e purchases are not expected to exceed depreciation of fixed assets 
year end inventories increased from the beginning of the year  prior to the addition of femcare 
average inventory turns were compared to in primarily because of the averaging anomaly of lower inventories prior to the femcare acquisition relative to cost of goods sold after the acquisition 
net after allowance for doubtful accounts year end trade accounts receivable a r balances increased  due to the femcare acquisition 
average days in a r on december  of days  based on q shipments  was down from days at the end of this performance remained well within management s continuing trade a r objective of days 
the company believes any older a r will be collected or are within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was  compared to  at year end compared to the end of  year end current assets declined  and year end current liabilities increased  this had a double whammy effect on the current ratio  which declined to from at the end of the decline in current assets resulted from a  decrease in cash and investments used in the purchase of femcare  and a  increase in current liabilities from the current portion of notes payable and interest payable resulting from the financing of the purchase of femcare 
nevertheless  the end of working capital amount exceeds utmd s needs for managing normal operations  meeting interest and debt repayment obligations  paying shareholder dividends and internally financing growth 
utmd paid a net  for femcare 
for the year  utmd paid  in shareholder cash dividends compared to  during which included a year end special dividend 
because the current portion of notes payable represents one year s loan principal repayment obligation and the current loan balance is about of a five year term loan  current liabilities at the end of will remain about the same 
similarly  because utmd expects to use cash generated from operations to pay down loan balances and continue shareholder dividends  current assets at the end of will remain about the same  yielding a current ratio at the end of about the same as at end of net intangible assets were  at the end of compared to  at the end of net intangible assets after accumulated amortization are comprised of the capitalized costs of obtaining patents and other intellectual property including technology rights  and identifiable intangibles and goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
the femcare intangible assets purchased by utmd in are described in note utmd s goodwill balance was  at the end of under current us gaap  goodwill is not expensed unless and until the market value of the acquired entity becomes impaired 
the three prior acquisitions of  and continue to be viable parts of utmd s overall business  representing of total sales in including derivative devices that ensued the acquisitions 
utmd does not expect the current goodwill value associated with the four acquisitions including femcare to become impaired in purchases of intangibles of in excluding femcare were offset by in amortization expense 
the non cash amortization expense of femcare identifiable intangible assets was  the non cash amortization expense of femcare identifiable intangible assets will be  or  at an average exchange rate of usd gbp 
net intangible assets at the end of represented of total assets  compared to at the end of b liabilities 
at the end of  utmd s total liabilities had increased  from the end of the resulting year end total debt ratio was  compared to at the end of total liabilities increased in large part because of the term loans which had a year end balance of  that utmd obtained to help finance the femcare stock purchase  and because of the deferred tax liability created as a result of the fifteen year tax consequence of the amortization of the intangible assets obtained in the acquisition which had a year end balance of 
the ireland subsidiary debt balance at the end of declined by from the end of actual principal payments were in euro terms  the note payable balance declined from at the end of to at the end of the femcare uk loan declined  in book value  compared to principal payments of  in great britain pound gbp terms  the note declined from  when issued in march to  at the end of the differences between the decline in the period end balances and the principal payments during the year resulted from timing of currency exchange rates applied to balance sheet balances 
principal payments on the femcare us loan were  as the note declined from  at inception in march to  at the end of utmd estimates that it will repay the femcare notes in about more years  and the ireland note over the next two years out of cash flow generated by its operations 
year end consolidated current liabilities were about times higher than at year end as a result of the addition of femcare liabilities including the associated current liability portions of the acquisition loans and income taxes due on earnings 
in addition to liabilities stated on the balance sheet  utmd has operating lease and purchase obligations described in note results of operations 
a revenues 
global consolidated sales in were  compared to  in and  in the company believes that revenue should be recognized at the time of shipment as title generally passes to the customer at the time of shipment 
revenue recognized by utmd is based upon documented arrangements and fixed contracts in which the selling price is fixed prior to acceptance and completion of an order 
revenue from product or service sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped or service completed and invoiced  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
there are no post shipment obligations which have been or are expected to be material to financial results 
there are circumstances under which revenue may be recognized when product is not shipped  which meet the criteria of sab the company provides engineering services  for example  design and production of manufacturing tooling that may be used in subsequent utmd manufacturing of custom components for other companies 
this revenue is recognized when utmd s service has been completed according to a fixed contractual agreement 
terms of sale are established in advance of utmd s acceptance of customer orders 
in the us  uk and australia  utmd generally accepts orders directly from and ships directly to end user clinical facilities  as well as third party med surg distributors  under utmd s standard terms and conditions t c of sale 
about of utmd s domestic direct sales go through third party med surg distributors which contract separately with clinical facilities to provide purchasing  storage and scheduled delivery functions for the applicable facility 
utmd s t c of sale are substantially the same in the us  uk and australia 
utmd may have separate discounted pricing agreements with a clinical facility or group of affiliated facilities based on volume of purchases 
pricing agreements with clinical facilities  or groups of affiliated facilities  if applicable  are established in advance of orders accepted or shipments made 
for existing customers  past actual shipment volumes determine the fixed price by part number for the next agreement period of one  two or three years 
for new customers  the customer s best estimate of volume is accepted by utmd for determining the ensuing fixed prices for the agreement period 
new customers typically have one year agreements 
prices are not adjusted after an order is accepted 
for the sake of clarity  the separate pricing agreements with clinical facilities based on volume of purchases disclosure is not inconsistent with utmd s disclosure above that the selling price is fixed prior to the acceptance of a specific customer order 
utmd may from time to time establish a similar fixed price agreement with a group purchasing organization gpo in the us gpos are bargaining agents for member hospitals  not customers of utmd 
except for an administrative fee  generally of utmd s sales to a gpo s members  the t c of gpo agreements are not materially different from utmd s standard t c of sale 
consolidated total sales in were up  or from domestic us sales were  in  compared to  in and  in utmd divides its domestic sales into two distribution categories direct sales which are sales to end user customers by utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are component or finished device sales to other companies where products are resold as part of another company s finished product offerings 
domestic direct sales represented of global consolidated sales in  compared to in and in as a percentage of total domestic sales  direct domestic sales were in  compared to in both and therefore  domestic oem sales were of total domestic sales in  and in and the primary change in was the addition of cooper surgical inc as a domestic oem customer for the filshie clip system 
international foreign sales in were  compared to  in and  in international sales were of global consolidated sales in  in and in of the international sales  were to customers in europe compared to in and in femcare shipped of utmd s total international sales in utmd s ireland subsidiary utmd ltd 
shipped of total international sales in usd terms in  compared to in and in utmd groups its sales into four general product categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician and patient safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease including letz  endometrial tissue sampling  transvaginal uterine sonography  diagnostic laparoscopy  surgical contraception and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal critical care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies  including providing vascular access  enteral feeding  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized applications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components as well as molded parts sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors enjoy a significant market share and may have differentiated product features protected by patents 
global revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
international revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
as a summary description of revenues in the above tables obstetrics 
the decline in total obstetrics l d device sales in was the result of a difficult us market lower utilization of specialty devices in us hospitals together with restrictive us gpo administrative agreements 
us domestic obstetric product sales declined  while international obstetric device sales increased 
intran iupc sales outside the us were up 
the gynecology electrosurgery urology es gyn product category encompasses all of femcare s products 
es gyn sales in excluding femcare increased 
with femcare  es gyn sales increased 
us domestic sales increased  while international es gyn sales increased 
the domestic sales increase was primarily due to sales to cooper surgical inc  which has an agreement with femcare for distribution of the filshie clip system in the us cooper surgical is now utmd s largest customer  with sales of million  about of total utmd sales 
the es gyn international sales increase included femcare direct sales in the uk and australia at end user prices 
neonatal intensive care unit nicu device sales decreased in the us and increased internationally 
the changes were consistent with utmd s experience described for the obstetrics product category 
blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm 
us domestic bpm sales decreased  while international bpm sales increased 
this category includes molded components some of which are not related to medical devices sold to other companies for use in their products 
the weakness experienced in us domestic medical device end user sales also extended to sales of components to other us companies 
utmd s second largest customer in  beijing sak  purchased million of deltran blood pressure monitoring kits from utmd ltd ireland for use in china 
looking forward to  utmd expects to begin obtaining benefits from its joint distribution rationalization program initiated after the acquisition of femcare in march for example  after providing reasonable notice to utmd s third party distributors in the uk and training its own sales and marketing employees at femcare  utmd anticipates selling its non femcare es gyn devices directly to end users in the uk 
in addition  because of the close proximity and availability of femcare management resources  utmd will begin selling its non femcare es gyn devices directly to end users in ireland 
continuing a deliberate conversion process  a few of utmd s more successful international distributors will have adopted the marketing of femcare s devices  and a few of femcare s more successful distributors will have adopted the marketing of utmd s non femcare devices 
based on having the benefit of a full year of femcare product sales and the advantages of combining international distribution capabilities  offset by anticipated continued weak demand for specialized medical devices in europe and the us  utmd projects sales will increase by about 
b gross profit 
utmd s gross profit  the surplus after subtracting costs of manufacture  including forming components  assembling  inspecting  packaging  sterilizing and shipping products  from net revenues  was  compared to  in and  in gross profit margins gpms  gross profits expressed as a percentage of net sales  were in compared to in and in despite rapid increases in raw materials costs and steady increases in unit labor costs in  utmd s gross profit margin gpm  gross profits divided by sales  was percentage points higher in than in the improvement was due to the combination of the cost savings from consolidating utmd s oregon molding operations into utah  improved manufacturing overhead and direct labor efficiencies  a different product mix  and direct sales in the uk and australia for femcare devices at end user prices instead of distributor wholesale prices 
ireland subsidiary gross profits are disproportionately lower than total utmd gross profits because all of the finished devices sold by utmd ltd were to third party international distributors at discounted wholesale prices  the bpm devices themselves are generally commodities now  and the costs of manufacturing in ireland  in particular labor related costs  are higher than in utah 
ireland subsidiary gross profits in euros were in compared to in and in the associated gpms were in  in and in the lower gpm in was due to a higher proportion of sales to utmd s lowest price bpm kit customer in china  and lower total sales which reduced absorption of fixed manufacturing overheads costs 
the femcare group subsidiary gross profits in gbp were  the associated gpm was 
prior to its acquisition by utmd  except for the assembly and servicing of reusable filshie clip applicators and some packaging operations  femcare subcontracted its manufacturing to third parties 
going forward  utmd expects to realize an important  if subtle  benefit from its own manufacturing quality and cost disciplines for certain femcare devices 
in particular  utmd will be able to employ its utah molding capabilities and ireland assembly and packaging operations 
in the us  gross profits were  in compared to  in and  in the associated gpms were in  in and in in the second half of  after review of accounting principles  utmd reallocated its us expenses of shipping products to customers which were previously included in cost of goods sold manufacturing expense to sales and marketing operating expense 
this reallocation of expenses did not impact operating profits  ebt or net income 
the following table illustrates the change us cost of goods sold prior to reallocation percent of sales reallocated shipping costs us cost of goods sold as reported percent of sales utmd expects that its consolidated gpm in will remain about the same as in because the benefits of bringing the manufacture of some femcare products in house and the higher gpm for converting some sales to end users rather than to distributors are expected to be offset by continued pricing pressure from us hospitals  higher costs of employee benefits including medical plan costs and unemployment taxes  and inflation in the cost of raw materials 
therefore  since sales are targeted to increase by about  gross profits are expected to increase by as well 
oem sales are sales of utmd components and subassemblies that are marketed by other companies as part of their product offerings 
utmd utilizes oem sales as a means to help optimize utilization of its capabilities established to satisfy its direct sales business 
looking forward  femcare will become an oem customer for utah and ireland operations 
as a general rule  prices for oem sales expressed as a multiple of direct variable manufacturing expenses are lower than for direct sales because utmd s oem business partners incur significant expenses of sales and marketing 
because of utmd s small size and period to period fluctuations in oem business  fixed manufacturing overhead expenses cannot be meaningfully allocated between direct and oem sales 
therefore  utmd does not report gpm by sales channels 
c operating income 
operating income is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  product development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
consolidated operating expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in the following table provides a comparison of operating expense categories for the last three years 
s m expenses r d expenses g a a litigation expense provision g a b corporate legal expenses g a c stock option compensation expense g a d management bonus accrual g a e outside accounting audit tax expenses g a f intangible asset amortization g a g acquisition expenses g a h all other g a expenses g a expenses total total operating expenses operating expenses of sales consolidated operating income in was  compared to  in and  in utmd s operating income margin oim  operating income divided by total sales  was in  compared to in and in the utmd ltd ireland subsidiary oim in was compared to in and in femcare s oim was 
utmd us oim in was compared to in and in looking forward to  utmd projects its consolidated operating income margin will improve by about one percentage point compared to as a result of consolidating g a expenses 
i s m expenses s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions  attending clinical meetings and medical trade shows  administering customer agreements  advertising  processing orders  shipping  paying commissions to outside representatives and funding gpo fees 
in markets where utmd sells directly to end users  which in was the us  uk and australia for a portion of the year for a portion of utmd s products  the largest component of s m expenses is the cost of employing direct sales representatives  including associated costs of travel  subsistence and communications 
the trade off between higher gross profit margins for selling directly at end user prices is higher s m expenses as a percent of sales 
this is reflected in the increase in s m expenses in after the acquisition of femcare 
as a percent of total sales  s m operating expenses were in compared to in both and s m expenses are expected to increase as a percentage of total sales to around in because utmd expects to convert its utah product sales from distributors in the uk to direct femcare sales  expects to convert its utah product sales in ireland to direct sales  and will have femcare s higher relative direct sales expenses for a full year 
s m expenses include all customer support costs including training 
in general  training is not required for utmd s products since they are well established and have been clinically widely used 
written instructions for use are packaged with all finished devices 
although utmd does not have any explicit contracts with customers to provide training  it does have third party group purchasing organization agreements in the us and uk under which it agrees to provide hospital members in service and clinical training as required and reasonably requested 
utmd promises prospective customers that it will provide  at no charge in reasonable quantities  copies of videotapes and other instruction materials developed for the use of its products 
utmd provides customer support from offices in the us  uk and australia by telephone  and employed representatives on a geographically dispersed basis  to answer user questions and help troubleshoot any user issues 
occasionally  on a case by case basis  utmd may utilize the services of an independent practitioner to provide educational assistance to clinicians 
all in service and training expenses are routinely expensed as they occur 
except for the consulting services of independent practitioners  all of these services are allocated from fixed s m overhead costs included in operating expenses 
historically  marginal consulting costs have been immaterial to financial results  which is also utmd s expectation for the future 
ii r d expenses r d expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs  developing innovative concepts  testing concepts for viability  validating methods of manufacture  completing any necessary premarketing clinical trials  regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control  responding to customer requests for product enhancements  and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes 
as a percent of sales  r d expenses were in compared to in and in utmd will continue to opportunistically invest in r d 
in  r d expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to be higher than in recent years as a result of the new projects identified as part of the femcare acquisition 
iii g a expenses g a expenses include the front office functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  corporate risk management  corporate governance  protection of intellectual property  amortization of identifiable intangibles and legal costs 
in most of these functional areas  there was a lot of redundancy immediately following the femcare acquisition  in addition to one time costs associated with the acquisition 
except for the noncash amortization expense of identifiable intangible assets resulting from the value of the femcare acquisition  utmd expects g a expenses to substantially decline in the following lettered items refer to the same g a subcategories in the table above a the higher litigation provision in was due primarily to changes related to the acquisition of femcare 
absent unforeseen litigation  utmd expects its litigation expense provision in should be about half that of b utmd expects routine expenses consistent with those in c stock option expense in was calculated using a black scholes pricing model for unvested options 
please see note for further explanation 
in  utmd expects option expense consistent with that of d accrued bonuses in will continue to depend both on utmd s overall profit performance and each individual employee s contribution to the financial and non financial success of the company 
e utmd now has operations in the us  uk  ireland and australia which require financial and internal controls audit and tax consulting 
therefore  costs are expected to remain about the same as costs 
f amortization of identifiable intangibles associated with the femcare purchases will be about million per year for fifteen years from the march acquisition date 
in the short year after the acquisition  this noncash amortization expense represented of total sales 
if sales increase for the year of  the full year s amortization expense will be about of sales  diluting the oim by almost one percentage point 
g utmd does not expect any acquisition expenses in h the last other g a expense category includes predominantly salaries  medical benefits  payroll taxes and other employee related expenses of g a employees  as well as corporate p l insurance  outside director fees  public shareholder relations expenses  property taxes  depreciation expense of g a pp e  among other more minor items 
in summary  in utmd expects the following operating expense categories to increase as a percentage of sales r d  s m and the amortization expense of intangible assets included as part of g a 
the combined increase of those categories is expected to be about two percentage points 
on the other hand  utmd expects to reduce g a expenses excluding the amortization of intangibles by about three percentage points  so that utmd s consolidated opm will overall increase by about one percentage point for the year 
if successful in achieving its sales and gross profit targets stated above  the resulting opm would yield operating profits in the range of to million  an increase of to compared to d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income noi includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology  rent from leasing underutilized property to others  income earned from investing the company s excess cash and gains or losses from the sale of assets  offset by non operating expenses noe which include interest on the femcare and ireland bank loans  bank service fees and excise taxes 
net noe was in compared to noi of in and in the largest portion of noe was interest expense on the bank loans 
all the other items listed above summed to in noi 
utmd expects net noe in of about interest expense 
in  utmd paid in interest expense on the femcare and ireland loans  compared to in and in on just the ireland loan 
the interest expense results from borrowing   and  in march for the purchase of femcare  and   in december to allow the repatriation of profits generated by utmd s ireland subsidiary since inception in through please see note  below 
due to decreasing loan balances  utmd estimates that its interest expense should be about in investment of excess cash 
investment income including gains and losses on sales in was  compared to in and in average lower interest rates and the use of over million cash in the femcare acquisition caused the reductions from cash in the us is generally currently held in non interest bearing bank accounts because avoiding the bank operating fees which would result from lower balances more than offsets the interest that can be earned at current rates 
interest from cash balances in australia is expected to be about in royalties 
femcare receives a royalty from licensing the use of the filshie intangibles to cooper surgical  inc as part of its distribution agreement in the us royalties in were utmd expects to receive in filshie royalties in presently  there are no arrangements under which utmd is receiving royalties from other parties 
other noi 
income received from renting underutilized warehouse space in ireland and parking lot space in utah for a cell phone tower  offset by bank fees and excise taxes  was in  in and in conservatively expecting it will not be able to rent ireland warehouse space in  utmd expects other noi will be about in earnings before income taxes ebt result from subtracting utmd s non operating expense from its operating income 
consolidated ebt was  in compared to  in and  in ebt margin is ebt divided by total sales 
utmd s consolidated ebt margin was in  in and in the ebt of utmd ltd 
ireland was in  in and in the respective ebt margins of utmd ltd 
ireland were in  in and in femcare s ebt was  ebt margin was 
utmd is targeting consolidated ebt in the range of million  an increase of to over in that range  assuming utmd s projection for sales  ebt margin would be approximately two percentage points higher than in the projected ebt margin improvement comes from an improved oim and lower interest expense in compared to e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes  often called the bottom line 
net income was  in   in and  in the effective consolidated corporate income tax provision rate was  and for the same periods respectively 
year to year fluctuations in the tax rate may result from variation in ebt contribution from femcare in the uk which has a current income tax rate of  but which will decline to as of april   variation in profits of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products and a rate on rental and other types of income  variation in the ebt contribution of femcare australia which is currently taxed at a rate of  variation in the ebt contribution of utmd us operations which are currently taxed at a combined federal and state rate prior to special us tax exclusions such as the manufacturing profit deduction  accelerated depreciation of certain assets and r d tax credit  and higher marginal tax rates for ebt in the us above million 
the possibility of lower corporate income tax rates in the us is not included in this projection 
management expects the consolidated average income tax provision rate to be at least one percentage point of ebt lower than the rate due to a greater proportion of consolidated ebt coming from the non us areas and a lower tax rate in the uk 
utmd s net income margin nim  net income expressed as a percentage of sales  was in  in and in because of the expected higher ebt margin and lower income tax provision rate in  management projects utmd s nim will once again exceed in utmd s profitability has consistently ranked it in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies  and has been the primary driver for utmd s excellent returns on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money  ie  have exercise prices below the applicable period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were in  in and in if utmd achieves the projections above  eps in will be in the range of share  a increase 
the ending weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands  compared to  shares in and  shares in dilution for in the money unexercised options for the year was shares in thousands  compared to in both and actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd after payment of dividends to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the applicable time period 
roe includes balance sheet measures as well as income statement measures 
roe for was before payment of dividends 
roe for was zero because in utmd paid out all of its net income to shareholders in the form of cash dividends
