employees dredging during  the company employed an average of full time salaried personnel in the us in addition  the company employs us hourly personnel  most of whom are unionized  on a project by project basis 
crews are generally available for hire on relatively short notice 
during  the company employed a daily average of hourly personnel to meet domestic project requirements 
in addition  at december   the company employed approximately expatriates  foreign nationals and local staff to manage and administer its middle east operations 
during  the company also employed a daily average of hourly personnel to meet project requirements in the middle east 

table of contents demolition at december   the demolition segment employed approximately full time salaried administrative employees  in addition to an average of hourly employees pursuant to four union agreements 
the hourly employees are hired on a project by project basis and are generally available for hire on relatively short notice 
safety safety of its employees is one of the highest priorities of great lakes 
the company promotes a safety culture committed to training  awareness and mutual responsibility for the wellbeing of workers 
accident prevention  safety and environmental protection have top priority in the company s business planning  in the overall conduct of its business  and in the operation and maintenance of its vessels and facilities 
unions the company is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements in the us that govern its relationships with its unionized hourly workforce 
however  four primary agreements apply to approximately of such employees 
the company s three contracts with local operators union for the northern  southern and gulf regions  representing approximately of its unionized workforce  are set to expire in october the company s collective bargaining agreement with seafarers international union expired in february and we have negotiated a new agreement which is subject to ratification by its members 
the company has not experienced any major labor disputes in the past five years and believes it has good relationships with the unions that represent a significant number of its hourly employees  however  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience labor strikes or disturbances in the future 
government regulations the company is subject to government regulations pursuant to the dredging act  the jones act  the shipping act   or shipping act  and the vessel documentation laws set forth in chapter of title of the united states code 
these statutes require vessels engaged in dredging in the navigable waters of the united states to be documented with a coastwise endorsement  to be owned and controlled by us citizens  to be manned by us crews  and to be built in the united states 
the us citizen ownership and control standards require the vessel owning entity to be at least us citizen owned and prohibit the chartering of the vessel to any entity that does not meet the us citizen ownership test 
environmental matters the company s operations  facilities and vessels are subject to various environmental laws and regulations related to  among other things dredging operations  the disposal of dredged material  protection of wetlands  storm water and waste water discharges  demolition activities  asbestos removal  transportation and disposal of wastes and materials  air emissions  and remediation of contaminated soil  sediments  surface water and groundwater 
the company is also subject to laws designed to protect certain marine species and habitats 
compliance with these statutes and regulations can delay appropriation and or performance of particular projects and increase related project costs 
non compliance can also result in fines  penalties and claims by third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury  as well as damages to property and natural resources 
certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  and the oil pollution act of impose strict and  under some circumstances joint and several  liability on owners and operators of facilities and vessels for investigation and remediation of releases and discharges of regulated materials  and also impose liability for related damages to natural resources 
the company s past and ongoing operations involve the use and from time to time the release or discharge of regulated materials which could result in liability under these and other environmental laws 
the company has remediated known releases and discharges as deemed necessary  but there can be no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred if for example third party claims arise or new conditions are discovered 

table of contents the company s projects may involve demolition  excavation  transportation  management and disposal of hazardous waste and other regulated materials 
various laws strictly regulate the removal  treatment and transportation of hazardous water and other regulated materials and impose liability for human health effects and environmental contamination caused by these materials 
the company s demolition business  for example  requires it to transport and dispose of hazardous substances and other wastes  such as asbestos 
the company takes steps to limit its potential liability by hiring qualified asbestos abatement subcontractors from time to time to remove such materials from our projects and some project contracts require the client to retain liability for hazardous waste generation 
based on the company s experience and available information  the company believes that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and liability for known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the company cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future  how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced  administered or interpreted  or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or to respond to newly discovered conditions  such as future cleanup matters or other environmental claims

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors address the material risks and uncertainties concerning our business 
you should carefully consider the following risks and other information contained or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k when evaluating our business and financial condition and an investment in our common stock 
should any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  such developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
we depend on our ability to continue to obtain federal government dredging contracts  and are therefore impacted by the amount of government funding for dredging projects 
a reduction in government funding for dredging contracts can reduce our revenues and profits 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from federal government dredging contracts 
revenues related to contracts with federal agencies or companies operating under contracts with federal agencies and its percentage as a total of dredging revenue for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  federal government dredging revenue in us  percent of dredging revenue from federal government 
table of contents amounts spent by the federal government on dredging are subject to the budgetary and legislative processes 
we would expect the federal government to continue to improve and maintain ports as it has for many years  which will necessitate a certain level of federal spending 
however  there can be no assurance that the federal government will allocate any particular amount or level of funds to be spent on dredging for any specified period 
in addition  federal government contracts can be canceled at any time without penalty to the government  subject to our contractual right to recover our actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the federal government will not cancel any federal government contracts that have been or are awarded to us 
a material reduction in government funding for dredging contracts could materially reduce our revenues and profits 
most of our dredging contracts are fixed price contracts pursuant to which we charge a fixed price per unit of material dredged 
if we are unable to accurately estimate our costs to complete our projects  our profitability could suffer 
most dredging contracts are fixed price contracts where the customer pays a fixed price per unit eg  cubic yard of material dredged 
fixed price dredging contracts carry inherent risks  including risks of losses from underestimating costs  operational difficulties and other changes that sometimes occur over the contract period 
one of the more significant factors that can adversely affect the profitability of a dredging project is inclement or hazardous weather conditions that exceed our estimates 
such an event can result in substantial delays in performance time and cause additional contract expenses 
in addition  most of our demolition contracts are fixed price contracts where the customer pays a fixed price for our performance under the contract 
fixed price demolition contracts carry similar risks to our fixed price dredging contracts 
if we were to significantly underestimate the costs on one or more significant contracts  the resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows or financial condition 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly 
our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
accordingly  you should not rely on the results of any past quarter or quarters as an indication of future performance in our business operations or valuation of our stock 
our operating results could vary greatly from quarter to quarter due to factors such as inclement or hazardous weather conditions that may result in underestimated delays in dredging and additional contract expenses  unplanned equipment downtime  environmental restrictions requiring that certain projects be performed in winter months to protect wildlife habitats  and equipment mobilization to and from projects 
if our results of operations from quarter to quarter fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively impacted 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations primary factors that determine operating profitability 
our use of the percentage of completion method of accounting could result in a change in previously recorded revenue and profit 
we recognize contract revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the majority of our work is performed on a fixed price basis 
contract revenue is accrued based on engineering estimates for the physical percent complete for dredging and estimates of remaining costs to complete for demolition 
we use accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for accounting policies relating to our use of the percentage of completion method  estimating costs  revenue recognition  combining and segmenting contracts 
table of contents and change order claim recognition 
percentage of completion accounting relies on the use of estimates in the process of determining income earned 
the cumulative impact of revisions to estimates is reflected in the period in which these changes are experienced or become known 
given the risks associated with the variables in these types of estimates  it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made  which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded net revenues and profits 
we are subject to risks related to our international dredging operations 
revenue from foreign contracts and its percentage to total dredging revenue for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  foreign revenue in us  percent of dredging revenue from foreign countries international operations subject us to additional potential risks  including uncertainties concerning import and export license requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  political and economic instability  reduced middle eastern demand as a result of fluctuations in the price of oil  the primary export in the middle east  restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the united states  difficulties in enforcing agreements through certain foreign legal systems  requirements of  and changes in  foreign laws  policies and regulations  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations without additional expense  taxation issues  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act  difficulty in enforcing our contractual rights  currency fluctuations  logistical and communication challenges  and improperly insured political  cultural and economic uncertainties  including acts of terrorism  civil unrest  war or other armed conflict 
in addition  our international operations are subject to us and other laws and regulations regarding operations in foreign jurisdictions 
these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include anti competition laws  anti corruption laws  tax laws  immigration laws and accounting requirements 
given the high level of complexity of these laws and despite the existence of our corporate compliance program  there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached  for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees  or failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise 
violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties  criminal sanctions against us  our officers  or our employees  prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to operate in one or more countries  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents one customer currently accounts for a significant portion of our international revenue 
revenue from contracts with the government of bahrain and entities with which it does business and its percentage to total foreign dredging revenue for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  bahrain government dredging revenue in us  percent of foreign dredging revenue from the bahrain government revenue from foreign projects over the last three years has been concentrated in bahrain and primarily with the government of bahrain 
the contraction in the middle east real estate market has slowed the rate of the region s infrastructure development 
if the government of bahrain further curtails its infrastructure investment or diversifies its use of dredging vendors  our revenue from this customer could decline further 
in february and march  bahrain experienced civil unrest that could result in governmental instability 
in response thereto  the government of bahrain has instituted several measures  including a national curfew  that have impacted although not materially to date our ability to execute on projects in bahrain 
it is uncertain whether this civil unrest will continue  whether the current protests and other activities will lead to any meaningful government changes  and what additional restrictions  if any  the bahrain government will establish 
if the government changes  these measures are sustained  or additional restrictions are established  our bahrain dredging operations  including the value of our assets related to such operations  may be adversely affected 
in addition  it is uncertain if current events in bahrain will alter the government s plans for infrastructure investment 
there are integration and consolidation risks associated with the matteson acquisition 
future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses  unexpected liabilities and risks associated with entering new markets  and we may be unable to profitably operate these businesses 
on december   we acquired matteson 
as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire additional companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
the matteson acquisition and future acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including risks associated with entering new markets  diversion of management s attention from our existing business  failure to retain key personnel or customers of any acquired business  assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves and potential impairment of acquired intangible assets 
although such risks and challenges have not yet arisen in connection with the matteson acquisition  we may not have the appropriate management  financial or other resources needed to integrate any businesses that we acquire 
any future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses and unexpected liabilities 
the amount of our estimated backlog is subject to change and not necessarily indicative of future revenues 
our contract backlog represents our estimate of the revenues that we will realize under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed 
for dredging contracts these estimates are based primarily upon the time and costs required to mobilize the necessary assets to and from the project site  the amount and type of material to be dredged and the expected production capabilities of the equipment performing the work 
for demolition contracts  these estimates are based on the time and remaining costs required to complete the project relative to total estimated project costs and project revenues agreed to with the customer 
however  these estimates are necessarily subject to variances based upon actual circumstances 
because of these factors  as well as factors affecting the time required to complete each job  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues or 
table of contents profitability 
in addition  a significant amount of our dredging backlog in relates to federal government contracts  which can be canceled at any time without penalty to the government  subject to our contractual right to recover our actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation 
below is our dredging backlog from federal government contracts as of december    and and the percentage of those contracts to total backlog as of the same date 
the amount of our federal government dredging backlog at december  and includes amounts acquired in connection with the matteson acquisition 
year ended december  federal government dredging backlog in us  percent of dredging backlog from federal government if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations  our revenue could suffer 
our contracts with federal  state and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations and other contract provisions 
serious violations of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments and fines and suspension from future government contracting 
if we are suspended from government work for any reason  we could suffer a material reduction in revenue and cash flows 
in addition  we may be subject to litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts  referred to in this annual report as qui tam actions  which could include claims for up to treble damages 
qui tam actions are sealed by the court at the time of filing 
the only parties privy to the information in the complaint are the complainant  the us government and the court 
therefore  it is possible that qui tam actions have been filed against us and that we are not aware of such actions or have been ordered by the court not to discuss them until the seal is lifted 
thus  it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure for qui tam actions 
we have indebtedness  which makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions 
as of december   we had indebtedness of million consisting of million of senior subordinated notes and million for a note issued as part of the matteson acquisition 
our debt could require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures  pay dividends and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industries  affect our competitiveness compared to our less leveraged competitors  increase our exposure to both general and industry specific adverse economic conditions  and limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 
if we are unable  in the future  to obtain bonding or letters of credit for our dredging contracts  our ability to obtain future dredging contracts will be limited  thereby adversely affecting our business 
we  like all dredging and demolition service providers and other contractors  are generally required to post bonds in connection with our domestic dredging contracts and bonds or letters of credit with our foreign dredging contracts to ensure job completion if we ever fail to finish a project 
we have entered into a bonding agreement with zurich  pursuant to which zurich acts as surety  issues bid bonds  performance bonds and payment bonds  and provides guarantees required by us in the day to day operations of our dredging business 
however  under 
table of contents certain circumstances as specified in the agreement  zurich is not obligated under the bonding agreement to issue future bonds for us 
historically  we have had a strong bonding capacity but  under standard terms in the surety market  surety companies issue bonds on a project by project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of collateral as a condition to issuing any bonds 
with respect to our foreign dredging business  we generally obtain letters of credit under our senior credit facility and a separate facility which is supported by ex im under ex im s working capital guarantee program 
however  the amount of letters of credit under these facilities is limited 
in addition  access to our senior credit facility and the ex im facility may be limited by failure to meet certain financial requirements or other defined requirements 
if we are unable to obtain bonds or letters of credit  our ability to take on future work would be severely limited 
our business would be adversely affected if we failed to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade  or if those provisions were modified or repealed 
we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict dredging in us waters and maritime transportation between points in the united states to vessels operating under the us flag  built in the united states  at least owned and operated by us citizens and manned by us crews 
we are responsible for monitoring the ownership of our common stock to ensure compliance with these laws 
if we do not comply with these restrictions  we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us market  and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer  resulting in severe penalties  including permanent loss of us dredging rights for our vessels  fines or forfeiture of the vessels 
in the past  interest groups have unsuccessfully lobbied congress to modify or repeal the jones act to facilitate foreign flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for us flag vessels under the jones act 
we believe that continued efforts may be made to modify or repeal the jones act or other federal laws currently benefiting us flag vessels 
if these efforts are ever successful  it could result in significantly increased competition and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
our common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership 
we are subject to government regulations pursuant to the dredging act  the jones act  the shipping act and the vessel documentation laws set forth in chapter of title of the united states code 
these statutes require vessels engaged in the transport of merchandise or passengers or dredging in the navigable waters of the us to be owned and controlled by us citizens 
the us citizenship ownership and control standards require the vessel owning entity to be at least us citizen owned 
our certificate of incorporation contains provisions limiting non citizenship ownership of our capital stock 
if our board of directors determines that persons who are not citizens of the us own more than of our outstanding capital stock or more than of our voting power  we may redeem such stock 
the required redemption price could be materially different from the current price of our common stock or the price at which the non citizen acquired the common stock 
if a non citizen purchases our common stock  there can be no assurance that he will not be required to divest the shares and such divestiture could result in a material loss 
such restrictions and redemption rights may make our equity securities less attractive to potential investors  which may result in our common stock having a lower market price than it might have in the absence of such restrictions and redemption rights 
capital expenditures and other costs necessary to operate and maintain our vessels tend to increase with the age of the vessel and may also increase due to changes in governmental regulations  safety or other equipment standards 
capital expenditures and other costs necessary to operate and maintain our vessels tend to increase with the age of the vessel 
accordingly  it is likely that the operating costs of our vessels will increase 

table of contents the average age of our more significant vessels as of december   by equipment type  is as follows type of equipment quantity average age in years hydraulic dredges hopper dredges mechanical dredges unloaders drillboats material and other barges total remaining economic life has not been presented because it is not reasonably quantifiable because  to the extent that market conditions warrant the expenditures  we can prolong the vessels lives indefinitely 
we operate in an industry where a significant portion of competitors equipment is of a similar age 
it is common in the dredging industry to make maintenance and capital expenditures in order to extend the economic life of equipment 
in addition  changes in governmental regulations  safety or other equipment standards  as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self regulatory organizations and customer requirements or competition  may require us  along with others in our industry  to make additional expenditures 
for example  if the us coast guard enacts new standards  we may be required to incur expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment eg more fuel efficient engines 
other new standard requirements could be significant and would affect other industry participants as well 
in order to satisfy any such requirement  we may need to take our vessels out of service for extended periods of time  with corresponding losses of revenues 
we may experience equipment or mechanical failures  which could increase costs  reduce revenues and result in penalties for failure to meet project completion requirements 
the successful execution of contracts requires a high degree of reliability of our vessels  barges and equipment 
the average age of our fleet as of december  was years 
breakdowns not only add to the costs of executing a project  but they can also delay the completion of subsequent contracts  which are scheduled to utilize the same assets 
we operate a scheduled maintenance program in order to keep all assets in good working order  but despite this  breakdowns can and do occur 
environmental regulations could force us to incur capital and operational costs 
our industry  and more specifically  our operations  facilities and vessels  are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to  among other things dredging operations  the disposal of dredged material  protection of wetlands  storm water and waste water discharges  demolition activities  asbestos removal  transportation and disposal of wastes and other regulated materials  air emissions  and remediation of contaminated soil  sediments  surface water and groundwater 
we  and others who participate in the marine industry  are also subject to laws designed to protect certain marine species and habitats 
compliance with these statutes and regulations can delay permitting and or performance of particular projects and increase related project costs 
these delays and increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
non compliance can also result in fines  penalties and claims by third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury  as well as damages to property and natural resources 
certain environmental laws such as the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of and the oil pollution act of impose strict and  under some circumstances  joint and several  liability on owners and operators of facilities and vessels for investigation and remediation of releases and discharges of regulated materials  and also impose liability for related damages to natural resources 
our past 
table of contents and ongoing operations involve the use and from time to time the release or discharge of regulated materials which could result in liability under these and other environmental laws 
we have remediated known releases and discharges as deemed necessary  but there can be no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred if  for example  third party claims arise or new conditions are discovered 
our projects may involve demolition  excavation  transportation  management and disposal of hazardous waste and other regulated materials 
various laws strictly regulate the removal  treatment and transportation of hazardous waste and other regulated materials and impose liability for human health effects and environmental contamination caused by these materials 
our demolition business  for example  requires us to transport and dispose of hazardous substances and other wastes  such as asbestos 
services rendered in connection with hazardous substance and material removal and site development may involve professional judgments by licensed experts about the nature of soil conditions and other physical conditions  including the extent to which hazardous substances and materials are present  and about the probable effect of procedures to mitigate problems or otherwise affect those conditions 
if the judgments and the recommendations based upon those judgments are incorrect  we may be liable for resulting damages  which may be material 
the failure of certain contractual protections to protect us from incurring such liability  such as staying out of the ownership chain for hazardous waste and other regulated materials and securing indemnification obligations from our customers or subcontractors  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows or financial condition 
environmental requirements have generally become more stringent over time  for example in the areas of air emissions controls for vessels and ballast treatment and handling 
new or stricter enforcement of existing laws  the discovery of currently unknown conditions or accidental discharges of regulated materials in the future could cause us to incur additional costs for environmental matters which might be significant 
we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 
increased concern about the potential impact of greenhouse gases ghg  such as carbon dioxide resulting from combustion of fossil fuels  on climate change has resulted in efforts to regulate their emission 
for example  there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations concerning ghg emissions including cap and trade legislation may be enacted  which could result in increased compliance costs for us 
legislation  international protocols  regulation or other restrictions on ghg emissions could also affect our customers 
such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for our customers or  in some cases  prevent a project from going forward  thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
additionally  in our normal course of operations  we use a significant amount of fossil fuels 
the costs of controlling our ghg emissions or obtaining required emissions allowances in response to any regulatory change in our industry could increase materially 
our business could suffer in the event of a work stoppage by our unionized labor force 
we are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements in the us that govern our industry s relationships with our unionized hourly workforce 
specifically  four primary agreements apply to approximately of these employees 
our three contracts with local operators union for the northern  southern and gulf regions  representing approximately of our unionized workforce  are set to expire in october our agreement with seafarers international union expired in february and we have negotiated a new agreement which is subject to ratification by its members 
the inability to successfully renegotiate contracts with these unions as they expire  or any future strikes  employee slowdowns or similar actions by one or more unions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 
our employees are covered by federal laws that may provide seagoing employees remedies for job related claims in addition to those provided by state laws 
substantially all of our seagoing employees are covered by provisions of the jones act and general maritime law 
these laws typically operate to make liability limits established by state workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and to permit these employees and their representatives to pursue actions against 
table of contents employers for job related injuries in federal or state courts 
because we are not generally protected by the limits imposed by state workers compensation statutes with respect to our seagoing employees  we have greater exposure for claims made by these employees as compared to industries whose employees are not covered by these provisions 
our business is subject to significant operating risks and hazards that could result in damage or destruction to persons or property  which could result in losses or liabilities to us 
the dredging and demolition businesses are generally subject to a number of risks and hazards  including environmental hazards  industrial accidents  encountering unusual or unexpected geological formations  cave ins below water levels  collisions  disruption of transportation services and flooding 
these risks could result in damage to  or destruction of  dredges  transportation vessels  other maritime structures and buildings  and could also result in personal injury  environmental damage  performance delays  monetary losses or legal liability to third parties 
our current insurance coverage may not be adequate  and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates  or at all 
we maintain various insurance policies  including hull and machinery  general liability and personal injury 
we partially self insure risks covered by our policies 
while we reserve for such losses for accounting purposes  we are not required to  and do not  specifically set aside funds for the self insured portion of claims 
at any given time  we are subject to multiple personal injury claims and we maintain substantial loss accruals for these claims 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business 
we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms  or at all 
our inability to obtain such insurance coverage at acceptable rates or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows or financial condition 
our demolition business includes key customer relationships and our reputation in the massachusetts construction market  both of which have been developed and maintained primarily by our demolition employees 
loss of any of these elements could materially reduce our demolition revenues and profits 
demolition contracts are entered into on a project by project basis  so we do not have continuing contractual commitments with our demolition customers beyond the terms of the current contract 
we benefit from key relationships with certain general and construction contractors in the massachusetts market but have transitioned these relationships to new management installed in we also benefit from our reputation in the massachusetts market developed over years of successfully performing on projects 
both of these aspects of the business were developed and are maintained primarily by the officers of nasdi 
the inability to maintain relationships with these customers or obtain new customers based on nasdi s reputation could reduce the revenue and profitability from demolition contracts 
our inability to retain certain executives could have a material adverse effect on our demolition segment s current customer relationships and reputation 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover that you may consider favorable 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us 
these provisions include limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend our charter documents  including stockholder supermajority voting requirements  the inability of stockholders to call special meetings  a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms  advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals  and 
table of contents the authority of our board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and to issue additional shares of our common stock 
we are also subject to the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock  unless board or stockholder approval was obtained 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  discourage others from making tender offers for our shares  lower the market price of our stock or impede the ability of our stockholders to change our management  even if such changes would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our stockholders may not receive dividends because of restrictions in our debt agreements  delaware law and state regulatory requirements 
our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the agreements governing our debt  including our senior credit agreement  our bonding agreements and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes 
in addition  under delaware law  our board of directors may not authorize payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of our surplus  as calculated in accordance with the delaware general corporation law  or  if we do not have a surplus  it is paid out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year 
to the extent we do not have adequate surplus or net profits  we will be prohibited from paying dividends 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult for holders to resell our common stock when they want or at prices that they find attractive 
the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market constantly changes 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include changes in market conditions  quarterly variations in our operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  announcements of strategic developments  significant contracts  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us  future sales of our equity or equity related securities  changes in the economy and the financial markets  departures of key personnel  changes in governmental regulations  and geopolitical conditions  such as acts or threats of terrorism  political instability  civil unrest or military conflicts 
in addition  in recent years  global stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons often unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 

table of contents adverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  access to capital and cost of capital 
the domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets have experienced and are experiencing significant volatility  disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability 
should we need additional funds or to refinance our existing indebtedness  we may not be able to obtain such additional funds 
we need liquidity to pay our operating expenses  interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock 
without sufficient liquidity  we will be forced to curtail our operations  and our business will suffer 
the principal sources of our liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
in the event these resources do not satisfy our liquidity needs  we may have to seek additional financing 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the volume of trading activities  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn 
if internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
the adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate paid with respect to our fixed rate indebtedness  foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge currency risk and heating oil commodity swap contracts to hedge the risk that fluctuations in diesel fuel prices will have an adverse impact on cash flows associated with our domestic dredging contracts 
the united states congress has passed  and the president has signed into law  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the financial reform act 
the financial reform act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions  including foreign currency hedging transactions 
the financial reform act requires the commodities futures and trading commission to promulgate rules relating to the financial reform act 
when the rules relating to the financial reform act are established  we will assess the effect  if any  they will have on us 
the rules adopted by the commodities futures and trading commission may in the future significantly reduce our ability to execute strategic hedges to manage our interest expense and reduce our fuel commodity uncertainty and thus protect cash flows 
in addition  the banks and other derivatives dealers who are our contractual counterparties will be required to comply with the financial reform act s new requirements  and the costs of their compliance will likely be passed on to customers such as ourselves  thus potentially decreasing the benefits to us of swap and hedging transactions and potentially reducing our profitability 
the current weakness in the economic environment and other factors could lead to our goodwill and other intangible assets becoming impaired  which may require us to take significant non cash charges against earnings 
under current accounting guidelines  we must assess  at least annually and potentially more frequently  whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired 
any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non cash charge against earnings  which charge could materially adversely affect our reported net income and our stock price 
we test goodwill annually for impairment in the third quarter of each year  or more frequently should circumstances dictate 
a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows  a significant adverse change in the economic environment  slower growth rates or our stock price falling below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods 
if we were to conclude that a future write down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary  then we would be required to record a non cash charge against earnings  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our reported net income and the book value of our stockholders equity

in addition  the company is the only us dredging service provider with significant international operations  which represented of its dredging revenues for dredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of the navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil  sand or rock 
the us dredging market consists of three primary types of work capital  beach nourishment and maintenance 
capital projects include large port deepenings and other infrastructure projects such as land reclamations 
beach nourishment projects include rebuilding of shoreline areas that have been damaged by storm activity or ongoing erosion 
maintenance projects include routine dredging of ports  rivers and channels to remove the regular build up of sediment 
with the acquisition of lw matteson  inc matteson assets on december   the company began to provide the following rivers lakes services in lake and river dredging  inland levee and construction dredging  environmental restoration and habitat improvement and other marine construction 
the company s bid market is defined as the aggregate dollar value of domestic projects on which the company bid or could have bid if not for capacity constraints bid market 
the company experienced an average combined bid market share in the us of over the prior three years  including  and of the domestic capital  beach nourishment and maintenance sectors  respectively 
the foregoing bid market data does not reflect rivers lakes activities which are separately categorized 
the company s bid market share of rivers lakes in the year of activity since acquisition is 
the company s fleet of dredges  of which eight are deployed internationally  material transportation barges  two drillboats  and numerous other specialized support vessels is the largest and most diverse fleet of any us dredging company 
the mobility of the company s fleet enables us to move equipment in response to changes in demand for dredging services to take advantage of the most attractive opportunities to employ our dredges 
the company estimates the replacement cost of the company s fleet to be in excess of billion in the current market 
the company s largest domestic dredging customer is the us army corps of engineers the corps  which has responsibility for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control of us waterways 
the advance of multi jurisdictional cost sharing arrangements are allowing the corps to utilize funds from 
table of contents sources other than the federal budget to prioritize additional projects where waterway infrastructure improvements can have an impact to large regions 
although some of a project s funding may ultimately be derived from multiple sources  the corps maintains the authority over the project and is the company s customer

in  demolition revenues accounted for of total revenues  above the prior three year average of 
the demolition segment s principal services consist of interior and exterior demolition of commercial and industrial buildings  salvage and recycling of related materials and removal of hazardous substances and materials 
the majority of the work has historically been performed in new england  however  the primary demolition subsidiary  nasdi  llc nasdi continues to expand its footprint into the new york area and the marine demolition market  and specifically into bridge demolition projects 
effective as of january   nasdi became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company also owns of amboy aggregates amboy and of terrasea environmental solutions terrasea as joint ventures 
amboy s primary business is dredging sand from the entrance channel to the new york harbor in order to provide sand and aggregate for use in road and building construction and for clean land fill 
amboy also imports stone from upstate new york and nova scotia and distributes it throughout the new york area 
terrasea is engaged in the environmental services business through its ability to remediate contaminated soil and dredged sediment treatment 
the company operates in two reportable segments dredging and demolition 
contract revenues most of the company s dredging contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid 
the types of equipment required to perform the specified service and the estimated project duration affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that dredging contractors will bid 
the company recognizes contract revenues under the percentage of completion method  based on the company s engineering estimates of the physical percentage completed for dredging projects and using a cost to cost approach for demolition projects 
for dredging projects  costs of contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the gross profit percentage expected to be achieved upon ultimate completion of each dredging project 
for demolition projects  contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the estimated gross profit percentage 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
claims for additional compensation due to the company are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled 
billings on contracts are generally submitted after verification with the customers of physical progress and may not match the timing of revenue recognition 
the difference between amounts billed and recognized as revenue is reflected in the balance sheet as either contract revenues in excess of billings or billings in excess of contract revenues 
contract modifications may be negotiated when a change from the original contract specifications is encountered  necessitating a change in project scope or performance methodology and or material disposal 
significant expenditures incurred incidental to major contracts are deferred and recognized as costs of contracts based on contract performance over the duration of the related project 
these expenditures are reported as prepaid expenses 
costs and expenses the components of costs of contract revenues include labor  equipment including depreciation  maintenance  insurance and long term rentals  fuel  subcontracts  rentals and project overhead 
hourly labor is generally hired on a project by project basis 
much of our domestic hourly labor force is represented by labor unions with collective bargaining agreements that expire at various dates during through  which historically have been extended without disruption 

table of contents costs of contract revenues vary significantly depending on the type and location of work performed and assets utilized 
generally  capital projects have the highest margins due to the complexity of the projects  while beach nourishment projects have the most volatile margins because they are most often exposed to variability in weather conditions 
the company s cost structure includes significant annual equipment related costs  including depreciation  maintenance  insurance and long term equipment rentals  averaging approximately to of total costs of contract revenues over the last three years 
during the year  both equipment utilization and the timing of cost expenditures fluctuate significantly 
accordingly  the company allocates these equipment costs to interim periods in proportion to revenues recognized over the year to better match revenues and expenses 
specifically  at each interim reporting date the company compares actual revenues earned to date on the company s dredging contracts to expected annual revenues and recognizes equipment costs on the same proportionate basis 
in the fourth quarter  any over or under allocated equipment costs are recognized such that the expense for the year equals actual equipment costs incurred during the year 
as a result of this methodology  the recorded expense in any interim period may be higher or lower than the actual equipment costs incurred in that interim period 
primary factors that determine operating profitability dredging 
the company s results of operations for its dredging segment for a calendar or quarterly period are generally determined by the following three factors bid wins and dredge employment the company s dredging segment generates revenues when the company wins a bid for a dredging contract and starts that project 
although the company s dredging equipment is subject to downtime for scheduled periodic maintenance and repair  the company seeks to maximize its revenues by employing its dredging equipment on a full time basis 
if a dredge is idle ie  the dredge is not employed on a dredging project or undergoing scheduled periodic maintenance and repair  the company does not earn revenue with respect to that dredge during the time period for which it is idle 
project and dredge mix the company s domestic dredging projects generally involve domestic capital  maintenance and beach nourishment work and its foreign dredging projects generally involve capital work 
in addition  the company s dredging projects vary in duration and  in general  projects of longer duration result in less dredge downtime in a given period 
moreover  the company s dredges have different physical capabilities and typically work on certain types of dredging projects 
accordingly  the company s dredges have different daily revenue generating capacities 
the company generally expects to achieve different levels of gross margin ie  gross profit divided by revenues for work performed on the different types of dredging projects and for work performed by different types of dredges 
the company s expected gross margin for a project is based upon the company s estimates at the time of the bid 
although the company seeks to bid on and win projects that will maximize its gross margin  the company cannot control the type of dredging projects that are available for bid from time to time  the type of dredge that is needed to complete these projects or the time schedule upon which these projects are required to be completed 
as a result  in some quarters the company works on a mix of dredging projects that  in the aggregate  have relatively high expected gross margins based on project type and dredges employed and in other quarters  the company works on a mix of dredging projects that  in the aggregate  have relatively low expected gross margins based on project type and dredges employed 
project execution the company seeks to execute all of its dredging projects consistent with its project estimates 
in general  the company s ability to achieve its project estimates depends upon many factors including weather  variances from estimated project conditions  equipment mobilization time periods  unplanned equipment downtime or other events or circumstances beyond the company s control 
if the company experiences any of these events and circumstances  the completion of a dredging project will often be accelerated or delayed  as applicable  and  consequently  the company will experience project results that are better or worse than its estimates 
the company does its best to estimate for events and circumstances that are not within its control  however  these situations are inherent in dredging 

table of contents demolition 
the company s demolition segment generates revenues when the company is awarded a contract for demolition services and starts the project 
the company s revenues from its demolition segment increase or decrease based upon market demand 
like the company s dredging segment  results of operations for the company s demolition segment fluctuate based upon project mix and the company s ability to execute its projects consistent with its estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or an estimation process that can affect the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows  as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results 
percentage of completion method of revenue recognition the company s contract revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which is by its nature based on an estimation process 
for dredging projects  the company uses engineering estimates of the physical percentage of completion 
for demolition projects  the company uses estimates of remaining costs to complete to determine the percentage of project completion 
in preparing estimates  the company draws on its extensive experience in the dredging and demolition businesses and its database of historical dredging information to ensure that its estimates are as accurate as possible  given current circumstances 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
claims for additional compensation are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled 
cost and profit estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis to reflect changes in expected project performance 
impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company believes that this estimate is a critical accounting estimate because i goodwill is a material asset and ii the impact of an impairment could be material to the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of july each year 
the company operates in two reportable segments dredging and demolition 
these reportable segments are the company s operating segments and the reporting units at which the company tests goodwill for impairment 
the company assesses the fair values of its reporting units using both a market based approach and an income based approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future market growth trends  forecasted revenues and expenses based upon historical operating data  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
the estimates are based on assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable  but such assumptions are subject to unpredictability and uncertainty 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value  and may result in the impairment of goodwill in the event that actual results differ from those estimates 
the market approach measures the value of a reporting unit through comparison to comparable companies 
under the market approach  the company uses the guideline public company method by applying estimated market based enterprise value multiples to the reporting unit s estimated revenue and adjusted ebitda 
the company analyzed companies that performed similar services or are considered peers 
due to the fact that there are no public companies that are direct competitors  the company weighed the results of this approach less than the income approach 
at both december  and  the dredging segment s goodwill was million and demolition segment s goodwill was million 

table of contents the company performed its most recent annual test of impairment as of july  for the goodwill in both the dredging and demolition segments with no indication of goodwill impairment as of the test date 
as of the test date  the fair value of both the dredging segment and the demolition segment were in excess of their carrying values by approximately and  respectively 
given the small margin with which the demolition segment s fair value is in excess of its carrying value  a more than insignificant decline in the demolition segment s future operating results or cash flow forecasts versus the segment s current forecasts could potentially cause a goodwill impairment charge to be recognized in a future period 
the company will perform its next scheduled annual test of goodwill in the third quarter of should no triggering events occur which would require a test prior to the next annual test 
no goodwill impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of for either segment because no triggering event occurred which would require such a test 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and the following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to great lakes dredge dock corporation and adjusted ebitda defined below as a percentage of contract revenues for the years ended december contract revenues costs of contract revenues gross profit general and administrative expenses gain on sale of assets net operating income interest expense net equity in earnings of joint ventures loss on foreign currency transactions net loss on extinguishment of debt income before income taxes income tax expense net income net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to great lakes dredge dock corporation adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda  as provided herein  represents net income attributable to great lakes dredge dock corporation  adjusted for net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense and debt extinguishment 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the company presents adjusted ebitda as an additional measure by which to evaluate the company s operating trends 
the company believes that adjusted ebitda is a measure frequently used to evaluate performance of companies with substantial leverage and that the company s primary stakeholders ie  its stockholders  bondholders and banks use adjusted ebitda to evaluate the company s period to period performance 
additionally  management believes that adjusted ebitda provides a transparent measure of the company s recurring operating performance and allows management to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance 
for this reason  the company uses a measure based upon adjusted ebitda to assess performance for purposes of determining compensation under the company s incentive plan 
adjusted ebitda 
table of contents should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  amounts determined in accordance with gaap including a operating income as an indicator of operating performance  or b cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
as such  the company s use of adjusted ebitda  instead of a gaap measure  has limitations as an analytical tool  including the inability to determine profitability or liquidity due to the exclusion of interest and income tax expense and the associated significant cash requirements and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization  which represent significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of indebtedness and capital expenditures needed to maintain the company s business 
for these reasons  the company uses operating income to measure the company s operating performance and uses adjusted ebitda only as a supplement 
the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to great lakes dredge dock corporation year ended december  in thousands net income attributable to great lakes dredge dock corporation adjusted for loss on extinguishment of debt interest expense  net income tax expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda components of contract revenues the following table sets forth  by segment and type of work  the company s contract revenues for the years ended december in thousands revenues dredging capital us capital foreign beach nourishment maintenance rivers lakes total dredging revenues demolition total revenues rivers lakes was established by the company on december  in connection with the matteson acquisition  and did not operate as part of the company prior to january  year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue was million in  a decrease of million  or  from total revenue of million 
the majority of the decrease was due to lower domestic revenues in the capital dredging market 
this was partially offset by increased revenues in the beach nourishment market and the demolition segment as well as the addition of rivers lakes dredging from the matteson acquisition 
highlights from the company s primary dredging sectors are as follows revenues from domestic capital dredging projects of million in decreased million  or  from revenues of million

revenues from maintenance dredging projects in were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in maintenance revenue in was uncharacteristically high because the corps put many delayed projects out to bid 
the company believes that funding of many maintenance projects bid in was augmented by the federal economic stimulus 
the company believes that substantially all of the stimulus funded projects were completed by june  in addition  the number of maintenance projects worked on during the second half of declined due to the dredging industry s response to the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico

bidding activity and backlog the following table sets forth  by segment and type of dredging work  the company s backlog as of the dates indicated in thousands december  december  december  backlog dredging capital us capital foreign beach nourishment maintenance rivers lakes total dredging backlog demolition total backlog represents backlog acquired by the company on december  in connection with the matteson acquisition 
the company s contract backlog represents its estimate of the revenues that will be realized under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed 
for dredging contracts these estimates are based primarily upon the time and costs required to mobilize the necessary assets to and from the project site  the amount and type of material to be dredged and the expected production capabilities of the equipment performing the work 
for demolition contracts  these estimates are based on the time and remaining costs required to complete the project relative to total estimated project costs and project revenues agreed to with the customer 
however  these estimates are necessarily subject to variances based upon actual circumstances 
because of these factors  as well as factors affecting the time required to complete each job  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues or profitability 
in addition  of the company s dredging backlog relates to federal government contracts  which can be canceled at any time without penalty to the government  subject to the company s contractual right to recover the company s actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation 
in addition  the company s backlog may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based upon the type and size of the projects the company is awarded from the bid market 
a quarterly increase or decrease of the company s backlog does not necessarily result in an improvement or a deterioration of the company s business 
the company s backlog includes only those projects for which the company has obtained a signed contract with the customer 
approximately of the company s backlog at december  is expected to be completed and converted into revenue in dredging the domestic dredging bid market totaled billion  a increase from the domestic dredging bid market of million 
the bid market grew primarily from federal and state funded projects for infrastructure and coastal restoration and protection 
the beach nourishment bid market was the primary 
table of contents reason for the increase as million was awarded in this is an increase of million from the bid market  which is over three times the size of the bid market 
the company won of the overall domestic bid market  above its win rate of the overall domestic bid market 
the company s three year average win rate is 
the domestic bid market benefited from many projects deferred from prior years by governmental entities that were let to bid in in addition  the bid market excluded dredging work related to the construction of sand berms off the coast of louisiana in response to the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico 
over million of sand berm construction work was awarded to the company directly by the prime contractor rather than through the customary bidding process 
variability in contract wins from period to period is not unusual 
the company believes trends in its win rate over the prior three year periods provide a historical background against which current year results can be compared 
the company s december  contracted dredging backlog was million 
this represents an increase of million  or  over the company s december  dredging backlog of million 
these amounts do not reflect approximately million of domestic low bids pending formal award and additional phases options pending on projects currently in backlog 
at december  the amount of domestic low bids pending award was million 
the increase in the company s annual dredging backlog is primarily the result of the significantly higher beach nourishment awards remaining in backlog at year end that were primarily awarded late in the third quarter of  partially offset by lower maintenance backlog as compared to the prior year 
the company won  or million  of the domestic capital dredging projects awarded in significant new awards during the year included million for channel deepening in new york s ambrose channel and million for louisiana coastal restoration

federal capital projects are being prioritized by the corps as it appropriates its annual funding for projects 
the company believes that many states and washington dc will continue to focus on marine infrastructure as significant port and harbor authorities recognize that the ongoing expansion of the panama canal and initiatives to increase exports heightens the need for the us to deepen its east and gulf coast ports to facilitate larger draft vessels from international trade 
due to certain regulatory and environmental hurdles  it does not appear that the first of these deepening projects will be released for proposal until the fourth quarter of in addition  the company won a million coastal restoration project in february that will add to its workload

the company has contracted dredging backlog related to beach nourishment of million at december  compared to million at the end of the company expects to perform its entire backlog throughout the beach nourishment market in was double the average bid market over the last three years 
in  many state and local governments experienced delays in getting the necessary funding to put their projects out to bid 
significant severe storms underscored the critical nature of these projects to the regions and the nation forcing beach nourishment projects that had been delayed to be brought to bid in the projects were funded with different combinations of federal  state and local resources allowing these communities to protect their coastlines from natural erosion and to provide a buffer to future severe storms 
the company won  or million  of the maintenance dredging projects awarded in harbor channel and river maintenance projects including million of work on the mississippi river and million of work in baltimore were awarded to the company in the company has contracted dredging backlog at december  for maintenance dredging of million which is million lower than the backlog at

the company currently expects to realize approximately million in revenue on this project with the potential for greater income once we finalize our participation 
we will mobilize the vessel and ancillary equipment to australia at the end of upon completion of the projects on which it is currently working 
the company s portion of the project is expected to take about months to complete 
the company also sees additional opportunities in the middle east  southeast asia and south america that it continues to pursue 
we have recently made strategic moves to bolster our international sales and marketing effort  as we see an abundance of opportunities ahead  which we believe can yield better results from a more aggressive approach 
rivers lakes won  or million  of the projects in the markets where the group provides operations 
rivers lakes has contracted backlog of million at december  which is million less than the backlog acquired in the matteson transaction 
the acquired backlog included million for a large project  which was completed in  requiring sediment removal from an inland lake 
rivers lakes backlog does not include million of low bids pending award that are expected to be formally awarded and under contract in the first quarter of during the year  the company began to pursue municipal lake projects which expand the company s service capabilities using existing equipment

normal increases or decreases in the level of working capital relative to the level of operational activity impact cash flow from operating activities 
in 
table of contents  lower net income and changes in working capital  resulted in lower net cash flows provided by operating activities 
working capital changes in were related to an increase in accounts receivable primarily from foreign operations which usually experience longer accounts receivable collection periods and demolition operations that increased in the latter half of the year  an increase in pipe inventories used to transport dredged material  and an income tax refund receivable that is included in other current assets related to estimated payments made for our federal tax return 
in  lower activity in foreign operations coupled with payments received on foreign accounts receivable that had been outstanding at the end of drove the increase in cash generated 
additionally  the increase in cash was generated by strong domestic dredging operations in  which have by comparison shorter accounts receivable collections periods

certain foreign projects performed by the company have warranty periods  typically spanning no more than three to five years beyond project completion  whereby the company retains responsibility to maintain the project site to certain specifications during the warranty period 
generally  any potential liability of the company is mitigated by insurance  shared responsibilities with consortium partners  and or recourse to owner provided specifications 
the company considers it unlikely that it would have to perform under any of the aforementioned contingent obligations  other than operating leases  and performance has never been required in any of these circumstances in the past 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a significant portion of the company s current dredging operations are conducted outside of the us  primarily in the middle east 
it is the company s policy to hedge foreign currency exchange risk on contracts denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  if available 
currently  the majority of the company s foreign dredging work is in bahrain 
the currency in bahrain  the bahraini dinar  is linked to the us dollar  therefore  there is no foreign currency exposure on these transactions 
at december   the company had one foreign exchange forward contract outstanding to offset the change in fair value on outstanding accounts receivable in brazilian real with a fair value of million 
we expect any gains or losses on the forward contract to be substantially offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the underlying exposure 
a adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rate would decrease the derivative value by million 
at december   the company had long term senior notes outstanding with a recorded book value of million 
the fair value of these notes  which bear interest at a fixed rate of  was million at december  based on market prices 
assuming a decrease in interest rates from the rates at december  the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have increased to million 
in may  the company entered into two interest rate swap arrangements  which are effective until december   to swap a notional amount of million from a fixed rate of to a floating libor based rate in order to manage the interest rate paid with respect to the company s senior subordinated notes 
the fair value asset of the swaps at december  was million and is recorded in current assets 
the swap is not accounted for as a hedge  therefore  the changes in fair value are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in each reporting period 
assuming a increase in interest rates at december   the fair value of the asset would decline by million 
a significant operating cost for the company is diesel fuel  which represents approximately of the company s costs of contract revenues 
the company uses fuel commodity forward contracts  typically with durations of less than one year  to reduce the impacts of changing fuel prices on operations 
the company does not purchase fuel hedges for trading purposes 
based on the company s projected domestic fuel consumption  a increase in the average price per gallon of fuel would have an immaterial effect on fuel expense  after the effect of fuel commodity contracts in place at december  at december  the company had outstanding arrangements to hedge the price of a portion of its fuel purchases related to domestic dredging work in backlog  representing approximately of its anticipated domestic fuel requirements for as of december   there were million gallons remaining on these contracts 
under these agreements  the company will pay fixed prices ranging from to per gallon 
at december   the fair value asset on these contracts was estimated to be million  based on quoted market prices and is recorded in other current assets 
a change in forward fuel prices would result in an immaterial change in the fair value of fuel hedges outstanding at december
