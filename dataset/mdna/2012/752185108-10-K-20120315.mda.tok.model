the corporation had several significant portfolio valuation changes that resulted in a net increase in unrealized appreciation of  total expenses were  for the year ended december  and this represents a  or decrease from the expense amount of  for the year ended december  critical accounting policies the corporation prepares its financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
for a summary of all significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 

table of contents the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require the corporation to closely monitor its accounting policies and procedures 
the corporation has two critical accounting policies that require significant judgment 
the following summary of critical accounting policies is intended to enhance your ability to assess the corporation s financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates 
valuation of investments the most important estimate inherent in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements is the valuation of its investments and the resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the management of the corporation and submitted to the board of directors for approval 
the corporation invests in loan  debt  and equity instruments 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistent valuation process for each investment 
the corporation analyzes and values each investment on a quarterly basis  and records unrealized depreciation for an investment that it believes has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of the recorded value of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  the corporation will record unrealized appreciation if it believes that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  its equity security has also appreciated in value 
these estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
on january   the corporation adopted accounting standards codification asc the corporation uses several approaches to determine the fair value of investments 
the main approaches are loan and debt securities are valued at cost when it is representative of the fair value of an investment or sufficient assets or liquidation proceeds exists from a sale of a portfolio company at its estimated fair value 
the loan and debt securities may be valued at an amount other than a similar level yielding market securities 
a loan or debt instrument may be reduced in value if it is judged to be of poor quality  collection is in doubt or insufficient liquidation proceeds exist 
equity securities may be valued using the market approach or income approach 
the market approach uses observable prices and other relevant information generated by similar market transactions 
it may include the use of market multiples derived from a set of comparables to assist in pricing the investment 
additionally  the corporation adjusts valuations if a subsequent significant equity financing has occurred that includes a meaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated  unrelated new investor 
the income approach employs a cash flow and discounting methodology to value an investment 
asc classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  used in the corporation s valuation at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable and significant inputs to determining the fair value 

table of contents all of the corporation s investments at december  are classified in level due to their privately held restricted nature 
in the valuation process  the corporation uses financial information received monthly  quarterly  and annually from its portfolio companies  which includes both audited and unaudited financial statements  annual projections and budgets prepared by the portfolio company and other financial and non financial business information supplied by the portfolio companies management 
this information is used to determine financial condition  performance  and valuation of the portfolio investments 
the valuation may be reduced if a company s performance and potential have significantly deteriorated 
if the factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome  the valuation may be restored 
another key factor used in valuing equity investments is recent arms length equity transactions with unrelated new investors entered into by the portfolio company 
many times the terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and the corporation  and the impact of the discrepancy in transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in our statement of operations as net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation 
revenue recognition interest income interest income generally is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt 
in such cases  interest is recognized at the time of receipt 
a reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate 
the rand sbic interest accrual is also regulated by the sba s accounting standards and financial reporting requirements for small business investment companies 
under these rules interest income cannot be recognized if collection is doubtful  and a reserve must be established 
the collection of interest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company s ability to continue as a going concern or the loan is in default more than days 
management also uses other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest 
the corporation may receive distributions from portfolio companies that are limited liability companies 
these distributions are classified as dividend income on the statement of operations and are recognized when the amount can be reasonably estimated 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with us gaap and ifrs 
asu is required to be applied prospectively in interim and annual periods beginning after december  early application is not permitted 
management does not anticipate that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on the process for measuring fair values or on the consolidated financial statements

the global economy experienced a great deal of turmoil throughout the last several years and this affected the debt and equity markets in the united states 
the markets have been improving but the effects of this economic crisis linger and the economy has yet to fully recover
