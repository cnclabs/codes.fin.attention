item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview otter tail corporation and its subsidiaries form a diverse group of businesses with operations classified into five segments electric  wind energy  manufacturing  construction and plastics 
our primary financial goals are to maximize earnings and cash flows and to allocate capital profitably toward growth opportunities that will increase shareholder value 
meeting these objectives enables us to preserve and enhance our financial capability by maintaining desired capitalization ratios and a strong interest coverage position and preserving investment grade credit ratings on outstanding securities  which  in the form of lower interest rates  benefits both our customers and shareholders 
our strategy is to continue to grow our largest business  the regulated electric utility and look for further realignment of our nonelectric business portfolio to lower our overall risk  create a more predictable earnings stream  improve our credit quality and preserve our ability to fund the dividend 
over time  we expect the electric utility business will provide approximately to of our overall earnings 
we expect our nonelectric businesses will provide to of our earnings  and will continue to be a fundamental part of our strategy 
reliable utility performance along with rate base investment opportunities over the next six years will provide a strong base of revenues  earnings and cash flows 
we also look to our nonelectric operating companies to provide organic growth as well 
organic  internal growth comes from new products and services  market expansion and increased efficiencies 
we expect much of our growth in our nonelectric businesses in the next few years will come from utilizing expanded plant capacity from capital investments made in previous years 
we are a committed long term owner and therefore we do not acquire companies in pursuit of short term gains 
however  we may divest operating companies that no longer fit into our strategy and risk profile over the long term 
our strategy focuses on realigning our portfolio of businesses and refocusing our capital investment in the electric utility 
in  in execution of our announced strategy  we sold iph  our food ingredient processing business  and wylie  our trucking company headquartered in west fargo  north dakota  which was included in our wind energy segment 
in january  we sold the assets of aviva  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company s waterfront equipment manufacturer that sells a variety of recreational equipment 
in february  we entered into an agreement to sell dms  our health services business  with an expected closing date of february  as a result of these and transactions  our business structure no longer includes health services or food ingredient processing segments  and now includes the remaining five segments listed above 
in evaluating our portfolio of operating companies  we look for the following characteristics a threshold level of net earnings and a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted average cost of capital  a strategic differentiation from competitors and a sustainable cost advantage  a stable or growing industry  an ability to quickly adapt to changing economic cycles  and a strong management team committed to operational excellence 
major growth strategies and initiatives in our future include planned capital budget expenditures of up to million for the years through of which million are for capital projects at otter tail power company otp  including million for otp s share of a new air quality control system at big stone plant and million for anticipated expansion of transmission capacity including million for multi value transmission projects and million for capx transmission projects

impact of inflation otp operates under regulatory provisions that allow price changes in fuel and certain purchased power costs to be passed to most retail customers through automatic adjustments to its rate schedules under fuel clause adjustments 
other increases in the cost of electric service must be recovered through timely filings for electric rate increases with the appropriate regulatory agency 
our wind energy  manufacturing  construction and plastics segments consist entirely of businesses whose revenues are not subject to regulation by ratemaking authorities 
increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
raw material costs  labor costs  fuel and energy costs and interest rates are important components of costs for companies in these segments 
any or all of these components could be impacted by inflation or other pricing pressures  with a possible adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products 
in recent years  our operating companies have faced strong inflationary and other pricing pressures with respect to steel  fuel  resin  lumber  concrete  aluminum and health care costs  which have been partially mitigated by pricing adjustments

also  our operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside our control 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be impacted by changing interest rates on short term and long term debt and ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies  which in part are based on certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
our common stock dividend payments have exceeded our net losses income in each of the last four years 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends to be declared and paid will depend on  among other things  our financial condition  improvement in earnings per share to levels in excess of the indicated annual dividend per share of  cash flows from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictions under our credit facilities and our future business prospects 
the decision to declare a quarterly dividend is reviewed quarterly by the board of directors

our ratio of earnings to fixed charges from continuing operations  which includes imputed finance costs on operating leases  was x for compared to x for  and our debt interest coverage ratio before taxes was x for compared to x for during  we expect these coverage ratios to increase  assuming net income meets our expectations 
chart off balance sheet arrangements we and our subsidiary companies have outstanding letters of credit totaling million  but our line of credit borrowing limits are only restricted by million of the outstanding letters of credit 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships 
these entities are often referred to as structured finance special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
business outlook we anticipate diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to 
this guidance reflects the current mix of businesses owned as we start out it considers the cyclical nature of some of our businesses and reflects challenges presented by current economic conditions  as well as our plans and strategies for improving future operating results 
our current consolidated capital expenditures expectation for is in the range of million to million 
this compares with million of capital expenditures in we plan to invest in generation and transmission projects for the electric segment that have the potential to positively impact our earnings and returns on capital 
future electric segment projects include the construction of a new air quality control system at big stone plant to meet requirements of the clean air act and regional haze regulations  investment in two miso determined multi value transmission projects that will serve the nine state miso region  and continuing investment  with other utilities  in three capx transmission projects already under way 
segment components of the corporation s earnings per share guidance range are as follows eps range low high electric wind energy manufacturing construction plastics corporate totals contributing to our earnings guidance for are the following items we expect net income to increase slightly in our electric segment in compared with this is based on new rates being in place in minnesota for a full year  rider recovery increases and an increase in capitalized interest costs related to larger construction expenditures  offset by lower conservation improvement program incentives and increases in operating and maintenance expenses due to higher benefit costs 
we expect significant improvement in operations from our wind energy segment in dmi has been able to stabilize production  improve productivity  align headcount with current production demands and eliminate the need for outsourced quality assurance staffing 
order backlog will continue to support current plant staffing at dmi s tulsa and west fargo plants 
dmi continues to experience increased pricing pressure on new orders due to overcapacity in the us market and significantly lower steel costs available to asian manufacturers 
potential exposure to liquidated damages  warranty claims  or remediation costs related to past production issues remain 
backlog in the wind energy segment is million for compared with million one year ago 
we expect earnings from our manufacturing segment to improve in due to the following factors o increased order volume and continuing improvement in economic conditions in the industries btd serves o improved performance at shoremaster as a result of bringing costs in line with current revenue levels  the sale of aviva and the closure of shoremaster s camdenton  missouri plant with relocation of camdenton s commercial production operations to shoremaster s fergus falls  minnesota and st 
augustine  florida facilities o stable earnings from to plastics o backlog for the manufacturing companies of approximately million for compared with million one year ago 
we expect higher net income from our construction segment in as it has implemented improved cost control processes in construction management and selectively bid on projects with the potential for higher margins 
backlog in place for the construction businesses is million for compared with million one year ago 
we expect a slight decrease in plastics segment net income in corporate general and administrative costs are expected to remain relatively flat between the years 
the sales of iph  wylie  aviva and dms were strategic decisions by management to monetize assets and divest of companies that do not fit with our current operating plans 
the divestitures free up liquidity going forward for upcoming electric segment capital investments and help ease the need to rely on the capital markets to fully fund these expenditures 
we will continue to review our portfolio to see where additional opportunities exist to improve our risk profile  improve credit metrics and generate additional sources of cash to support the future capital expenditure plans of our electric segment 
this will result in a larger percentage of our earnings coming from our most stable and relatively predictable business  otp  and is consistent with the strategy to grow this business given its current investment opportunities 
the following table shows our capital expenditures and through anticipated capital expenditures and electric utility average rate base in millions capital expenditures electric segment transmission environmental other total electric segment nonelectric segments total capital expenditures total electric utility average rate base execution on the currently anticipated electric utility capital expenditure plan is expected to grow rate base and be a key driver in increasing utility earnings over the through timeframe 
we intend to maintain our equity to total capitalization ratio near its present level of in the electric segment and will seek to earn our authorized overall return on equity of approximately in the utility s regulatory jurisdictions 
regarding the collective operating companies in the nonelectric segments  there is a general expectation that business will strengthen in and as the us economy slowly recovers 
this is expected to lead to increased demand for our industrial products and services  generating higher revenues 
this expectation  coupled with cost reductions that have taken place across the corporation  are expected to result in rising earnings per share for the nonelectric businesses as a whole 
our outlook for is dependent on a variety of factors and is subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in item a 
risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies involving significant estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations 
estimates are used for such items as depreciable lives  asset impairment evaluations  tax provisions  collectability of trade accounts receivable  self insurance programs  unbilled electric revenues  accrued renewable resource and transmission rider revenues  valuations of forward energy contracts  percentage of completion  warranty and actuarially determined benefits costs and liabilities 
as better information becomes available or actual amounts are known  estimates are revised 
operating results can be affected by revised estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and the development of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits obligations and costs pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and expenses for our electric utility and corporate employees are determined by actuaries using assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and healthcare cost trend rates 
further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these benefits  for any individual employee  can be earned and related expenses can be recognized and a liability accrued over periods of up to or more years 
these benefits can be paid out for up to or more years after an employee retires 
estimates of liabilities and expenses related to these benefits are among our most critical accounting estimates 
although deferral and amortization of fluctuations in actuarially determined benefit obligations and expenses are provided for when actual results on a year to year basis deviate from long range assumptions  compensation increases and healthcare cost increases or a reduction in the discount rate applied from one year to the next can significantly increase our benefit expenses in the year of the change 
also  a reduction in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets in our funded pension plan or realized rates of return on plan assets that are well below assumed rates of return could result in significant increases in recognized pension benefit expenses in the year of the change or for many years thereafter because actuarial losses can be amortized over the average remaining service lives of active employees 
the pension benefit cost for for our noncontributory funded pension plan is expected to be million compared to million in  reflecting no change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets of in and  but reflecting a decrease in the estimated discount rate used to determine annual benefit cost accruals from in to in in selecting the discount rate  we consider the yields of fixed income debt securities  which have ratings of aa published by recognized rating agencies  along with bond matching models specific to our plans as a basis to determine the rate 
subsequent increases or decreases in actual rates of return on plan assets over assumed rates or increases or decreases in the discount rate or rate of increase in future compensation levels could significantly change projected costs 
for  all other factors being held constant a increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pension benefit cost by  a decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pension benefit cost by  a increase in the assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels would have increased our pension benefit cost by  a decrease in the assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels would have decreased our pension benefit cost by  and a increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased our pension benefit cost by  increases or decreases in the discount rate or in retiree healthcare cost inflation rates could significantly change our projected postretirement healthcare benefit costs 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased our postretirement medical benefit costs by  a decrease in the discount rate would have increased our postretirement medical benefit costs by  see note to our consolidated financial statements for the cost impact of a change in medical cost inflation rates 
we believe the estimates made for our pension and other postretirement benefits are reasonable based on the information that is known at the point in time the estimates are made 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of variables and are subject to change 
revenue recognition dmi  shoremaster and our construction companies record operating revenues on a percentage of completion basis for fixed price construction contracts 
the method used to determine the progress of completion is based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to total estimated labor hours at dmi  and costs incurred to total estimated costs on all other construction projects 
the duration of the majority of these contracts is less than a year 
revenues recognized on jobs in progress as of december  were million 
any expected losses on jobs in progress at year end have been recognized 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the percentage of completion accounting on uncompleted contracts is critical to the extent that any underestimate of total expected costs on fixed price construction contracts could result in reduced profit margins being recognized on these contracts at the time of completion 
forward energy contracts classified as derivatives otp s forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity are derivatives subject to mark to market accounting under generally accepted accounting principles 
the market prices used to value otp s forward contracts for the purchases and sales of electricity and electricity generating capacity are determined by survey of counterparties or brokers used by otp s power services personnel responsible for contract pricing  as well as prices gathered from daily settlement prices published by the intercontinental exchange and cme globex 
for certain contracts  prices at illiquid trading points are based on a basis spread between that trading point and more liquid trading hub prices 
these basis spreads are determined based on available market price information and the use of forward price curve models and  as such  are estimates 
the forward energy sales contracts that are marked to market as of december   are offset by forward energy purchase contracts in terms of volumes and delivery periods but not in terms of delivery points 
the differential in forward prices at the different delivery locations currently results in a net mark to market unrealized gain on otp s open forward contracts 
otp s recognized but unrealized net gains of  on forward purchases and sales of electricity marked to market on december  are expected to be realized on settlement as scheduled over the following periods in the amounts listed in thousands st qtr nd qtr rd qtr th qtr total net gain allowance for doubtful accounts our operating companies encounter risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
as such  they record provisions for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the operating companies primarily utilize historical rates of accounts receivables written off as a percentage of total revenue 
this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis 
the historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate  such as a significant increase or decrease in collection performance and timing of payments as well as the calculated total exposure in relation to the allowance 
periodically  operating companies compare identified credit risks with allowances that have been established using historical experience and adjust allowances accordingly 
in circumstances where an operating company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet financial obligations  the operating company records a specific allowance for bad debts to reduce the account receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
we believe the accounting estimates related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is critical because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
during   of bad debt expense of total revenue of billion was recorded and the allowance for doubtful accounts was million of gross trade accounts receivable as of december  general economic conditions and specific geographic concerns are major factors that may affect the adequacy of the allowance and may result in a change in the annual bad debt expense 
an increase or decrease in our consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts based on one percentage point of outstanding trade receivables at december  would result in a million increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
although an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts on our operating companies accounts receivable is provided for  the allowance for doubtful accounts on the electric segment s wholesale electric sales is insignificant in proportion to annual revenues from these sales 
the electric segment has not experienced a bad debt related to wholesale electric sales largely due to stringent risk management criteria related to these sales 
nonpayment on a single wholesale electric sale could result in a significant bad debt expense 
depreciation expense and depreciable lives the provisions for depreciation of electric utility property for financial reporting purposes are made on the straight line method based on the estimated service lives to years of the properties 
such provisions as a percent of the average balance of depreciable electric utility property were in  in and in depreciation rates on electric utility property are subject to annual regulatory review and approval  and depreciation expense is recovered through rates set by ratemaking authorities 
although the useful lives of electric utility properties are estimated  the recovery of their cost is dependent on the ratemaking process 
deregulation of the electric industry could result in changes to the estimated useful lives of electric utility property that could impact depreciation expense 
property and equipment of our nonelectric operations are carried at historical cost or at the then current replacement cost if acquired in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are depreciated on a straight line basis over useful lives to years of the related assets 
we believe the lives and methods of determining depreciation are reasonable  however  changes in economic conditions affecting the industries in which our nonelectric companies operate or innovations in technology could result in a reduction of the estimated useful lives of our nonelectric operating companies property  plant and equipment or in an impairment write down of the carrying value of these properties 
taxation we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities 
these tax obligations include income  real estate and use taxes 
these judgments could result in the recognition of a liability for potential adverse outcomes regarding uncertain tax positions that we have taken 
while we believe our liability for uncertain tax positions as of december  reflects the most likely probable expected outcome of these tax matters in accordance with the requirements of accounting standards codification asc  income taxes  the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in additional adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
however  we do not believe such adjustments would be material 
deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
we assess our deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration both our historical and anticipated earnings levels  the reversal of other existing temporary differences  available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this assessment  management must evaluate the need for  and amount of  a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as facts and circumstances change  adjustments to the valuation allowance may be required 
we have recorded a valuation allowance related to the probability of recovery of our deferred tax assets recorded on foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
asset impairment we are required to test for asset impairment relating to property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may exceed its fair value and not be recoverable 
we apply the accounting guidance under asc  property  plant  and equipment subsequent measurement  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard requires that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from a company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying amount of the asset 
we believe the accounting estimates related to an asset impairment are critical because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period reflecting changing business cycles and require management to make assumptions about future cash flows over future years and the impact of recognizing an impairment could have a significant effect on operations 
management s assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
in  asset impairments were recorded at dmi and otesco 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for details 
as of december  an assessment of the carrying amounts of our remaining long lived assets and other intangibles indicated these assets were not impaired 
goodwill impairment goodwill is required to be evaluated annually for impairment  according to asc  goodwill subsequent measurement 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment and requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment is recognized 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  a second step must be performed 
the second step is to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is lower than the carrying amount  an impairment adjustment must be recorded 
we believe accounting estimates related to goodwill impairment are critical because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as earnings growth rate  require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues 
additionally  asc requires goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 
we currently have million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet related to the acquisitions of the companies in our plastics segment 
our plastics segment consists of businesses producing polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe in the upper midwest and southwest regions of the united states 
our plastics segment has continued to generate cash flows and earnings during the through timeframe while being in an industry that has been significantly challenged due to low housing and construction starts 
if the current economic conditions were to more severely impact the sales and profitability of this segment such that it started to generated lower levels of operating profits and ultimately turn to net losses  these reductions in anticipated cash flows from the business may indicate  in a future period  that its fair value is less than the carrying value resulting in an impairment of some or all of the goodwill associated with the plastics segment along with a corresponding charge against earnings 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and as conditions warrant 
an assessment of the carrying amounts of our goodwill as of december  indicated the fair values of our reporting units are substantially in excess of their respective book values and not impaired 
acquisition method of accounting we account for acquisitions under the requirements of asc  business combinations 
under asc the term purchase method of accounting is replaced with acquisition method of accounting and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
acquired assets and liabilities assumed that are subject to critical estimates include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
the fair value of property  plant and equipment is based on valuations performed by qualified internal personnel and or with the assistance of outside appraisers 
fair values assigned to plant and equipment are based on several factors including the age and condition of the equipment  maintenance records of the equipment and auction values for equipment with similar characteristics at the time of purchase 
intangible assets are identified and valued using the guidelines of asc the fair value of intangible assets is based on estimates including royalty rates  customer attrition rates and estimated cash flows 
while the allocation of purchase price is subject to a high degree of judgment and uncertainty  we do not expect the estimates to vary significantly once an acquisition is complete 
we believe our estimates have been reasonable in the past as there have been no significant valuation adjustments to the allocation of purchase price 
forward looking information safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the act 
when used in this form k and in future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission sec  in the company s press releases and in oral statements  words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  continue  estimate  project  believes or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions  and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include the various factors set forth in item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k and in our other sec filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  we had no exposure to market risk associated with interest rates because we had no debt outstanding subject to variable interest rates 
at december  we had exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
dmi has market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at its plant in fort erie  ontario because the plant pays its operating expenses in canadian dollars 
all of our consolidated long term debt has fixed interest rates 
we manage our interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities  through economic refunding of debt through optional refundings  limiting the amount of variable interest rate debt  and the utilization of short term borrowings to allow flexibility in the timing and placement of long term debt 
we have not used interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
we maintain a ratio of fixed rate debt to total debt within a certain range 
it is our policy to enter into interest rate transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet our stated objectives 
we do not enter into interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
dmi and the companies in our manufacturing segment are exposed to market risk related to changes in commodity prices for steel  lumber  aluminum  cement and resin 
the price and availability of these raw materials could affect the revenues and earnings of our wind energy and manufacturing segments 
the plastics companies are exposed to market risk related to changes in commodity prices for pvc resins  the raw material used to manufacture pvc pipe 
the pvc pipe industry is highly sensitive to commodity raw material pricing volatility 
historically  when resin prices are rising or stable  sales volume has been higher and when resin prices are falling  sales volumes has been lower 
operating income may decline when the supply of pvc pipe increases faster than demand 
due to the commodity nature of pvc resin and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide  it is very difficult to predict gross margin percentages or to assume that historical trends will continue 
otp has market  price and credit risk associated with forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
as of december  otp had recognized  on a pretax basis   in net unrealized gains on open forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity and electricity generating capacity 
due to the nature of electricity and the physical aspects of the electricity transmission system  unanticipated events affecting the transmission grid can cause transmission constraints that result in unanticipated gains or losses in the process of settling transactions 
the market prices used to value otp s forward contracts for the purchases and sales of electricity and electricity generating capacity are determined by survey of counterparties or brokers used by otp s power services personnel responsible for contract pricing  as well as prices gathered from daily settlement prices published by the intercontinental exchange and the cme globex 
for certain contracts  prices at illiquid trading points are based on a basis spread between that trading point and more liquid trading hub prices 
these basis spreads are determined based on available market price information and the use of forward price curve models 
the forward energy sales contracts that are marked to market as of december   are offset by forward energy purchase contracts in terms of volumes  delivery periods but not in terms of delivery points 
the differential in forward prices at the different delivery locations currently results in a mark to market unrealized gain on otp s open forward contracts 
we have in place an energy risk management policy with a goal to manage  through the use of defined risk management practices  price risk and credit risk associated with wholesale power purchases and sales 
volumetric limits and loss limits are used to adequately manage the risks associated with our energy trading activities
