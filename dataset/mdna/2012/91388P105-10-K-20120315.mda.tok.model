item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are primarily an asset light provider of transportation services to shippers throughout the united states and in the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec 
we offer flatbed and dry van trucking services  as well as rail truck and steamship truck intermodal and truck brokerage services 
we primarily operate through a contractor network of independent sales agents and owner operators of tractors and trailers 
in return for their services  we pay our agents and owner operators a percentage of the revenue they generate for us 
our owner operators provided us with approximately  tractors and approximately  trailers  which represented substantially all of the tractors and over of the trailers used in our business 
our use of agents and owner operators reduces our need to provide terminals and tractor and trailer fleets 
the primary physical assets we provide to our agents and owner operators include a portion of our trailer fleet  our headquarters facility  our management information systems and our intermodal depot facilities 
our business model provides us with a highly variable cost structure  allows us to grow organically using relatively small amounts of cash  gives us a higher return on assets compared to many of our asset based competitors and preserves an entrepreneurial spirit among our agents and owner operators that we believe leads to improved operating performance 
in  approximately of our total operating expenses were variable in nature 
our capital expenditures for were million and our return on average assets was 
over the past ten years  our operating revenues have increased to million in  reaching a maximum level of million in  from million in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
we have achieved this growth through a mixture of organic growth and acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions of companies that complement our asset light business model  as well as companies that derive a portion of their revenues from asset based operations 
we believe that our willingness to expand our business to include a portion of asset based operations will expand the universe of potential acquisition targets  as most companies that we consider acquiring use a combination of asset based and non asset based operations 
we also intend to continue our organic growth  primarily by recruiting new agents and increasing the productivity of our existing agents 
we believe that increasing our agent network is critical to our ability to penetrate new shipping markets and also to expand our network of owner operators

revenues and expenses operating revenues 
we generate substantially all of our revenues through fees charged to customers for the transportation of freight 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  container storage and other services 
our historical revenue growth has been primarily driven by increases in the volume of freight shipped 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
the main factors that affect our shipping rates are competition  available truck capacity  and economic market conditions 
we recognize our revenues at the time of delivery to the receiver s location 
for service arrangements  we recognize revenue after the related services have been rendered 
purchased transportation 
purchased transportation represents the amount we pay our owner operators or other third party equipment providers to haul freight and includes the amount of fuel surcharges that we pass through to our owner operators 
the amount of the purchased transportation we pay to our owner operators is primarily based on a contractually agreed upon percentage of our revenue for each load hauled 
purchased transportation is the largest component of our costs and increases or decreases proportionately with changes in the amount of revenue generated by our owner operators and other third party providers 
we recognize purchased transportation expenses at the time we recognize the associated revenue 
commissions expense 
commissions expense represents the amount we pay our agents for generating shipments on our behalf 
the commissions we pay to our agents are generally established through informal oral agreements and are based on a percentage of revenue generated by each load hauled 
traditionally  commissions increase or decrease in proportion to the revenues generated through our agents 
we recognize commission expenses at the time we recognize the associated revenue 
other operating expense 
other operating expenses represent the repair  tires and parts expenses primarily related to the maintenance of company owned leased trailers and lift equipment  and operating taxes and licenses  net of the rental income we receive from leasing our trailers to our owner operators 
we recognize these expenses as they are incurred and the rental income as it is earned 
selling  general and administrative 
employee compensation and benefits historically have accounted for over of our selling  general and administrative expense 
other components of selling  general and administrative expense include allowance for doubtful customer accounts  communications and rent expense 
insurance and claims 
insurance and claims expense represents our insurance premiums and the accruals we make for claims within our self insured retention amounts 
our insurance premiums are generally calculated based on a percentage of line haul revenue 
our accruals have primarily related to cargo and property damage 
table of contents claims 
we may also make accruals for personal injuries and property damage to third parties  physical damage to our equipment  and workers compensation claims if we experience a claim in excess of our insurance coverage 
to reduce our exposure to non trucking use liability claims claims incurred while the vehicle is being operated without a trailer attached or is being operated with an attached trailer which does not contain or carry any cargo  we require our owner operators to maintain non trucking use liability coverage  which we refer to as deadhead bobtail coverage  of million per occurrence 
our exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by other third party providers who haul freight on our behalf is reduced by various factors including the extent to which they maintain their own insurance coverage 
our insurance expense varies primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience  insurance rates  our coverage limits and our self insured retention amounts 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to the depreciation of trailers  management information services equipment  buildings and equipment as well as the amortization of the intangible assets recorded for our acquired customer and agent relationships 
we estimate the salvage value and useful lives of depreciable assets based on current market conditions and experience with past dispositions

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are funds generated by operations  our ability to borrow on margin against our marketable securities held at ubs  proceeds from the sales of marketable securities  and our revolving unsecured line of credit with keybank 
we employ a primarily asset light operating strategy 
substantially all of the tractors and more than of the trailers utilized in our business are provided by our owner operators and we have no capital expenditure requirements relating to this equipment 
as a result  our capital expenditure requirements are limited in comparison to most large trucking companies which maintain sizable fleets of owned tractors and trailers  requiring significant capital expenditures 
the company continues to expand its domestic intermodal operations through the acquisition of containers 
during  the company added containers to its fleet to provide for expansion in this business line 
we expect to have limited capital expenditure requirements relating to the maintenance of this equipment  however  we will continue to acquire additional containers to meet our business needs 

table of contents in  we have made capital expenditures totaling million 
these expenditures primarily consisted of tractors  trailers  containers and computer  office  and miscellaneous equipment 
in  exclusive of acquisitions  we expect to incur capital expenditures of million to million relating to real property acquisitions and improvements to our existing facilities and terminal yards 
we also expect to incur capital expenditures of million to million for tractors  trailers  containers  chassis  and other equipment 
we expect that our working capital and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet our capital commitments and fund our operational needs for at least the next twelve months 
based on the availability under our line of credit  against our marketable security portfolio and other financing sources and assuming the continuation of our current level of profitability  we do not expect that we will experience any liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate business development opportunities  including potential acquisitions that fit our strategic plans 
there can be no assurance that we will identify any opportunities that fit our strategic plans or will be able to execute any such opportunities on terms acceptable to us 
any such opportunities will be financed from available cash and cash equivalents and our unsecured line of credit 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings to finance our growth and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
unsecured line of credit on october   the company and keybank national association  or keybank  entered into a change in terms agreement to the amended and restated loan agreement and promissory note dated october   collectively referred to as the agreement  whereby the maturity date of the existing amended and restated loan agreement and promissory note was extended to october  under the agreement  the company s maximum permitted borrowings and letters of credit in the aggregate may not exceed million 
the line of credit is unsecured  and bears interest at a rate equal to the lesser of the prime rate minus or libor plus effective rate of at december  
the agreement contains various financial and restrictive covenants to be maintained by the company including requirements to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million  a debt to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to  and quarterly net profits of at least one dollar 
for purposes of this agreement  tangible net worth is defined as total assets  excluding all intangible assets  less total debt 
the agreement also may  in certain circumstances  limit our ability to pay dividends or distributions utilizing our line of credit 
the agreement also contains customary representations and warranties  affirmative and negative covenants and events of default 
at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
the company did not have any amounts outstanding under its line of credit as of december   and there were  letters of credit issued against the line 
secured line of credit the company maintains a secured borrowing facility at ubs financial services  inc  or ubs  using its marketable securities as collateral for the short term line of credit 
the line of credit bears an interest rate equal to libor plus effective rate of at december   and interest is adjusted and billed monthly 
no principal payments are due on the borrowing  however  the line of credit is callable at any time 
the amount available under the line of credit is based on a percentage of the market value of the underlying securities 
if the equity value in the account falls below the minimum requirement  the company must restore the equity value  or ubs may call the line of credit 
as of december  the outstanding balance under the line of credit was  and the maximum available borrowings against the line of credit were million 

table of contents discussion of cash flows at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million in resulted from million in cash used in investing activities and million of in cash used in financing activities 
this was partially offset by million in cash provided by operating activities 
the million in net cash used in investing activities in consisted of million of capital expenditures  million in purchases of marketable securities  and million for the acquisition of businesses  offset by million in proceeds from the sales of marketable securities and million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
the million in cash used in financing activities in consisted of a million special cash dividend  million in the purchases of treasury stock and million for the payments of earnout obligations 
the million in net cash provided by operations was primarily attributed to million of net income adjusted for million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  a million gain on the sales of marketable securities  million in changes in deferred income taxes  million of non cash charges for provisions for doubtful accounts  and a decrease in the working capital position of the company of million 
the decrease in the working capital position is primarily the result of increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities primarily resulting from higher contractor payables due to increased revenues and book overdrafts  and an increase in other long term liabilities 
these increases are partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to increased revenue  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due to a higher prepaid income tax position 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations total as of december   the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was thousand 
this amount is not included in the above table as the company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements  if any  with taxing authorities

legal matters we are subject to various legal proceedings and other contingencies  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we accrue for estimated losses if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we use judgment and evaluate  with the assistance of legal counsel  whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be disclosed or recorded 
the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and so typically a loss cannot be precisely estimated 
accordingly  if the outcome of legal proceedings are different than is anticipated by us  we would have to record the matter at the actual amount at which it was resolved  in the period resolved  impacting our results of operations and financial position for the period 

table of contents critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  operating revenues and operating expenses 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become even more subjective and complex 
in order to provide an understanding about how our management forms its judgments about future events  including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates  and the sensitivity of those judgments to different circumstances  we have identified our critical accounting policies below 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
management continuously monitors these factors to arrive at the estimate of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to owner operators 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates 
changes in the facts and circumstances that these estimates are based upon and changes in the general economic environment could result in a material change to the allowance for uncollectible receivables 
these changes include  but are not limited to  deterioration of customers financial position  changes in our relationships with our customers  agents and owner operators and unforeseen issues relating to individual receivables 
insurance and claim costs we maintain auto liability  workers compensation and general liability insurance with licensed insurance carriers 
we are self insured for all cargo and equipment damage claims 
insurance and claims expense represents premiums paid by us and the accruals made for claims within our self insured retention amounts 
a liability is recognized for the estimated cost of all self insured claims including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and for claims expected to exceed our policy limits 
in addition  legal expenses related to auto liability claims are covered under our policy 
we are responsible for all other legal expenses related to claims 
as of december   we did not have any reserves for workers compensation or general liability claims 
we do establish reserves for anticipated losses and expenses related to cargo and equipment damage claims and auto liability claims 
the reserves consist of specific reserves for all known claims and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported  and losses arising from known claims ultimately settling in excess of insurance coverage using loss development factors based upon industry data and past experience 
in determining the reserves  we specifically review all known claims and record a liability based upon our best estimate of the amount to be paid 
in making our estimate  we consider the amount and validity of the claim  as well as our past experience with similar claims 
in establishing the reserve for claims incurred but not reported  we consider our past claims history  including the length of time it takes for claims to be reported to us 
based on our past experience  the time between when a claim occurs and when it is reported to us is short 
as a result  we believe that the number of incurred but not reported claims at any given point in time is small 
these reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect our experience and updated information relating to specific claims 
if we experience claims that are not covered by our insurance or that exceed our estimated claim reserve  it could increase the volatility of our earnings and have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents valuation of long lived asset  including goodwill and intangible assets we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently  whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill below its carrying amount 
we annually test goodwill impairment as of the last day of our nd fiscal quarter 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions 
we continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  overall weaknesses in our industry  and slower growth rates 
adverse changes in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether or not it is necessary to perform a two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
if the company chooses that option  it would not be required perform step of the test unless we determine that  based on a qualitative assessment  it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if the company determines that it is more likely than not  or if the company chooses not to perform a qualitative assessment  then it may then proceed with step of the two step impairment test 
under the first step  we compare the fair value of each of the company s reporting units with goodwill to their related carrying values 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and we must perform step two of the impairment test 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units utilizing the income approach through the application of a discounted cash flow analysis 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit are a future expected cash flows  b estimated residual growth rates  and c discount rates  which were based on the company s best estimates of the after tax weighted average cost of capital 
additionally  the company considers its market capitalization in comparison to the fair value of its reporting units 
during the third quarter of  we completed our goodwill impairment testing and determined that the fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill exceeded the carrying value of its net assets 
accordingly  no impairment loss was recognized 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment by analyzing the operating performance and anticipated future cash flows for those assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the need to adjust the carrying value of the underlying assets if the sum of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying value 
our projection of future cash flows  the level of actual cash flows  the methods of estimation used for determining fair values and salvage values can impact impairment 
any changes in management s judgments could result in greater or lesser annual depreciation and amortization expense or impairment charges in the future 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
other than temporary impairments periodically  we review all available for sale securities for other than temporary impairment 
an impairment that is an other than temporary impairment is a decline in the fair value of a security below its cost basis attributable to factors that indicate the cost basis in the security may not be recoverable in the near term 
the determination of an other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  and requires judgment and assumptions that could affect the timing of loss realization 
we consider several factors including the severity and duration of the decline  the financial condition and near term prospects of the specific issuers and the industries in which they operate  and our intent and ability to hold these securities for a sufficient period of time to allow for a recovery 
if  in our judgment  the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is written down to the then current market value  and the unrealized loss is transferred from accumulated other 
table of contents comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings 
gross unrealized holding losses of million as of december  have not been recognized in earnings as these impairments in value were judged to be temporary 
we may incur future impairment charges if declines in market values continue or worsen and impairments are no longer considered temporary
