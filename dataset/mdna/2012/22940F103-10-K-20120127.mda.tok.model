business overview our sales were higher but our business was less profitable for fiscal year than in the same period a year ago 
the increase in sales was largely due to an acquisition and expansion of product lines completed at the start of the fiscal year 
lower sales of traditional products  abnormally stormy weather  spending on information systems infrastructure and non recurrence of a legal settlement resulted in lower profitability 
water sales were less than the previous year  in part  because of adverse winter weather in the first quarter of compared to abnormally warm weather in the third quarter of in the company s market area 
due to the fact that the sales increase related to products other than water  as a percentage of sales  gross margin declined 
new products offered in conjunction with our brand expansion yield a lower gross margin than water and coffee  in general 
we experienced higher operating expenses during the year  in part to upgrade our customer relationship and e commerce software  which resulted in lower net income compared to a year ago 
in we received legal settlement of   net of tax  that did not recur in in late august  tropical storm irene caused considerable and widespread damage in parts of our market area 
the primary effect on our business was due to flooding that damaged or destroyed some highways  roads and bridges  making it more difficult for our delivery trucks to reach customers in vermont and northern new york 
in addition  our vermont spring sources temporarily became inaccessible 
access to these sources has now been restored 
there was no material limitation to our ability to service our customers  but our route and transportation costs temporarily increased in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
the storm impacted our business in that quarter and  to a lesser extent  in the first quarter of the effect is difficult to quantify because of other variables but there has been no lasting material effect on our business 
in addition  parts of connecticut and massachusetts experienced a major snowstorm in late october  shutting off power and access in some parts of those states for more than a week 
again  it became more difficult for our delivery trucks to reach our customers in those areas 
the major portion of the financial effect from this event was in the first quarter of although it did not have a lasting material adverse effect on our operations  it did result in decrease in sales for the periods that were difficult to quantify 
we continue to have adequate cash on hand while reducing debt 
in  we used a significant amount of cash to commence an upgrade of our information technology infrastructure to facilitate an expansion of our product offerings and run our business more efficiently 
in we commenced our plan to sell office products 
to date  we are selling these lines only in connecticut 
accordingly  these activities may require us to use more cash and increase debt to take advantage of market expansion and future sales growth and profit margin opportunities 
the market area in which we operate has an uncertain economic environment 
while we have created opportunities that we expect will result in increased sales  we anticipate cost pressures related to commodities affecting our business  most notably  fuel and coffee  and building our brands 
results of operations fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  sales sales for fiscal year were  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
sales attributable to acquisitions in fiscal year were  net of the acquisitions  sales increased 
the comparative breakdown of sales is as follows product line in s in s difference in s diff 
water coffee and related equipment rental other total water the aggregate decrease in water sales was a result of a decrease in price and a decrease in volume 
the decrease in price and the amount of water sold was attributable to competition 
in addition  winter snow storms in southern new england and spring and summer flooding in northern new england reduced volume distribution during acquisitions had no impact in the change of water sales in fiscal year compared to coffee and related products the increase in sales was primarily due to a increase of traditional coffee and growth in sales of single serve coffee 
also there was a increase in ancillary coffee refreshment products 
coffee sales grew as a result of strong market demand despite higher pricing 
single serve coffee sales increased to  in from  in acquisitions did not materially affect this category in compared to equipment rental the decrease in equipment rental revenue in fiscal year compared to the prior year was a result of a decrease in placements that more than offset a increase in average rental price 
the decrease in placements was due to lower market demand 
acquisitions had no impact in the change of rental revenue in fiscal year compared to other the increase in other revenue is attributable to higher sales of other products  which increased  most notably water in single serve containers and cups 
the increase also reflects an increase in fuel adjustment fees that are charged to offset energy costs for delivery and freight  raw materials  and bottling operations as a result of higher fuel prices 
fuel adjustment charges increased in from in addition  office products and stamps which were not sold the prior year  accounted for sales of  in gross profit cost of goods sold gross profit increased  or  in fiscal year compared to  to  from  as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to of sales from for the respective periods 
the decrease in gross profit margin was attributable to higher product costs  particularly for coffee  and changes in product sales mix most notably lower water and rental sales and higher sales of coffee  refreshment  and office products which yield a lower margin 
gross profit in fiscal year was favorably impacted by an increase in fuel adjustment charges that are charged to offset energy costs for delivery and freight  raw materials  and bottling operations 
cost of goods sold includes all costs to bottle water  costs of purchasing and receiving products for resale  including freight  as well as costs associated with product quality  warehousing and handling costs  internal transfers  and the repair and service of rental equipment  but does not include the costs of distributing our product to our customers 
we include distribution costs in selling  general  and administrative expense  and the amount is reported below 
other companies may include distribution costs in their cost of goods sold  in which case  on a comparative basis  such other companies may have a lower gross margin as a result 
income from operations operating expenses income from operations was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  total operating expenses increased to  for the year  from  the prior year  an increase of  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  in fiscal year and  in  an increase of  or 
of total sg a expenses route sales costs increased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  primarily related to higher fuel costs which more than offset lower labor costs 
included as a component of route sales costs are total direct distribution related costs which increased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  primarily as a result of higher fuel costs  selling costs increased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year as a result of higher computer related service costs to support the infrastructure improvement of e commerce and customer relationship management software 
during fiscal  we expensed  related to information technology upgrades  administrative costs increased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  as a result of higher labor costs despite lower professional fees related to compliance and litigation 
advertising expenses increased to  in fiscal year from  in  an increase of  or 
the increase in advertising costs is primarily related to an increase in agency costs and internet advertising that more than offset a decrease in yellow page advertising and brochures 
amortization decreased  to  in fiscal year from  in amortization is attributable to intangible assets that were acquired as part of acquisitions in recent years 
there was a loss from the sale of miscellaneous assets in fiscal year of  compared to a loss on the sale of assets of  in fiscal year these were sales of miscellaneous assets no longer used in the course of business 
we conducted an assessment of goodwill as of october  and the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill is a two step process 
in step one  the fair value of the company is determined  using a weighted average of three different approaches quoted stock price a market approach  value comparisons to publicly traded companies see note 
believed to have comparable reporting units a market approach  and discounted net cash flow an income approach 
these approaches provide a reasonable estimation of the value of the company and take into consideration the company s thinly traded stock and concentrated holdings  market comparable valuations  and expected results of operations 
we used the following percentages for the weighted average of the three different approaches in both fiscal year and quoted stock price value comparisons to publicly traded companies discounted net cash flow the resulting estimated fair value is then compared to the company s equity value 
the assessments concluded that the company s fair value exceeded the company s equity  therefore goodwill was not impaired as of the respective valuation dates 
since step one indicated no impairment  step two was not necessary 
if impairment had been indicated  we would have then allocated the estimated fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the company including unrecognized intangible assets as if the company had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value was the price paid 
we then would have recognized impairment in the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied value of goodwill as determined in this allocation

in fiscal year the company received a one time payment of  as a legal settlement that did not recur in income before income taxes in fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year  a decrease of  operating results were lower as a result of higher operating expenses and the non recurrence of the one time payment mentioned above 
tax expense for fiscal year was  compared to  for fiscal year and resulted in an effective tax rate of in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate from to was primarily a result of a settlement of a state tax issue that was favorable to the company 
our total effective tax rate is a combination of federal and state rates for the states in which we operate 
net income net income in fiscal year was  compared to net income of  in  a decrease of  the variance was primarily attributable to lower income from operations and non operating legal settlement in  net of a higher tax provision 
net income in both years was completely attributable to continuing operations 
based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding of  basic and diluted  income per share in fiscal year was

this was a decrease of

the fair value of our interest rate hedge swap agreements increased favorably  during fiscal year compared to an unfavorable decrease of  in this resulted in unrealized gain of  and unrealized loss of  net of reclassification adjustments and taxes  respectively  for the fiscal years ended october  and the increase during the year has been recognized as an adjustment to net income to arrive at comprehensive income as defined by the applicable accounting standards 
liquidity and capital resources as of october   we had working capital of  compared to  as of october   an increase of  the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease is a result of lower net income in a significant portion of net income was derived from a legal settlement which resulted in  net of tax 
we use cash provided by operations to repay debt and fund capital expenditures 
in fiscal year  we used  for repayment of debt 
this was  less than we paid in because of a  one time repayment of senior debt and an unscheduled re payment of  on our subordinated debt in we used  less for capital expenditures in than in we spent less on water bottles and coolers and more on coffee brewers in than in in addition  there were less capital expenditures on computers and software in but we used  in cash to fund information technology infrastructure upgrades which were operating expenses due to the nature of the upgrades 
we used  more cash to complete acquisitions in than the prior year 
as a result of lower debt re payment and capital expenditures as well as less cash used for taxes  attributable to a lower tax rate  in there was a net increase in cash of  for the year 
in  the net increase in cash was  as a result of more cash provided by operating activities despite higher debt re payment and capital expenditures 
our credit agreement with bank of america has a total loan capacity of  and obligates the company to a  term note and access to a  revolving line of credit 
the revolving line of credit can be used for the purchase of fixed assets  to fund acquisitions  to collateralize letters of credit  and for operating capital 
since sufficient cash was generated from operations  we have not borrowed from the facility in the past two years so there was no balance on the line of credit as of october  however  it collateralized a letter of credit of  consequently  as of october   there was  available to borrow from the revolving line of credit 
there was  outstanding on the term note as of october  in addition  as of that date  we had  of debt subordinated to our senior credit facility 
as of the end of fiscal year  we had three interest rate hedge swap agreements 
a agreement old swap fixed the interest rate on of the outstanding balance on the term loan the swapped amount with bank of america as required by the previous facility 
the old swap fixed the interest rate for the swapped amount related to the previous facility at and matures in january we entered into an agreement offsetting swap when the previous facility was amended to offset the old swap  for which we receive of the scheduled balance of the old term loan effectively limiting any exposure to change in the fair value of the old swap and set a fixed net payment schedule based on the scheduled balance of the old term loan until january when both the old and offsetting swaps mature 
finally  we entered into an agreement new swap to fix the interest rate of of the outstanding balance of the new term note at plus the applicable margin  maturing may as of october   the total notional amount committed to the new swap agreement was  this agreement provides for a monthly settlement in which the company would make or receive payments at a variable rate determined by a specified index one month libor in exchange for making payments at a fixed rate of 
on that date  the variable rate on the remaining of the term note  was 
the credit agreement requires that we be in compliance with certain financial covenants at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the covenants include senior debt service coverage as defined of greater than to  total debt service coverage as defined of greater than to  and senior debt to ebitda as defined of no greater than to as of october   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of our credit facility and we expect to be in compliance in the foreseeable future 
under the agreement  the company is obligated to calculate consolidated excess cash flow based on its financial results for the fiscal year to determine if additional principal is due on the term note 
based on the results for fiscal year  a  principal payment is due by february  the agreement also prohibits us from paying dividends without prior consent of the lender 
in addition to our senior and subordinated debt commitments  we have significant future cash commitments  primarily in the form of operating leases that are not reported on the balance sheet 
these operating leases are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the following table sets forth our contractual commitments as of october  payment due by period contractual obligations total after debt interest on debt operating leases total interest based on of outstanding senior debt at the hedged interest rate discussed above  of outstanding senior debt at a variable rate of  and subordinated debt at a rate of 
customer deposits have been excluded from the table 
deposit balances vary from period to period with water sales but future increases and decreases in the balances are not accurately predictable 
deposits are excluded because  net of periodic additions and reductions  it is probable that a customer deposit balance will always be outstanding as long as the business operates 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we have no other material contractual obligations or commitments 
inflation has had no material impact on our performance 
factors affecting future cash flow generating cash from operating activities and access to credit is integral to the success of our business 
we continue to generate cash from operating activities to service scheduled debt repayment and fund capital expenditures 
in addition  we have capacity to borrow from our acquisition line of credit for capital expenditures and acquisitions 
we also lease a significant amount of our vehicles and all of our buildings 
adverse economic conditions in recent years have negatively impacted many businesses financial performance and restricted credit availability 
although our sales have increased the past two years we do not think that the economy in our region has fully recovered 
the competitive landscape created by the economic environment has eroded our margin over that time 
as mentioned above  we have used cash to build an information technology infrastructure to facilitate the expansion of our product offerings and run our business more efficiently to gain an immediate competitive edge and prosper when the economy in our region improves 
however  no assurance can be given that the future economic environment will not adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations or that we will have adequate access to credit 
factors affecting quarterly performance our business and financial trends vary from quarter to quarter based on  but not limited to  seasonal demands for our products  climate  and economic and geographic trends 
consequently  results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative  through extrapolation  or otherwise  of results for a longer period 
in the past year we have experienced weather related events that have influenced quarterly performance 
although weather is always variable  we feel this year s extremes  and their far reaching effects  are an aberration in the region 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of the statements in accordance with these principles requires that we make estimates  using available data and our judgment for such things as valuing assets  accruing liabilities  and estimating expenses 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts we routinely review our accounts receivable  by customer account aging  to determine if the amounts due are collectible based on information we receive from the customer  past history  and economic conditions 
in doing so  we adjust our allowance accordingly to reflect the cumulative amount that we feel is uncollectible 
this estimate may vary from the proceeds that we actually collect 
if the estimate is too low  we may incur higher bad debt expenses in the future resulting in lower net income 
if the estimate is too high  we may experience lower bad debt expense in the future resulting in higher net income 
fixed assets depreciation we maintain buildings  machinery and equipment  and furniture and fixtures to operate our business 
we estimate the life of individual assets to allocate the cost over the expected life 
the basis for such estimates is use  technology  required maintenance  and obsolescence 
we periodically review these estimates and adjust them if necessary 
nonetheless  if we overestimate the life of an asset or assets  at a point in the future  we would have to incur higher depreciation costs and consequently  lower net income 
if we underestimate the life of an asset or assets  we would absorb too much depreciation in the early years resulting in higher net income in the later years when the asset is still in service 
goodwill intangible asset impairment we have acquired a significant number of companies 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired has been recorded as goodwill 
if goodwill is not impaired  it would remain as an asset on our balance sheet at the value assigned in the acquisitions 
if it is impaired  we would be required to write down the asset to an amount that accurately reflects its estimated value 
we completed a valuation of the company performed as of october  and  and goodwill was not impaired as of those dates 
the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill is a two step process 
in step one  the fair value of the company is determined  using a weighted average of three different approaches quoted stock price a market approach  value comparisons to publicly traded companies believed to have comparable reporting units a market approach  and discounted net cash flow an income approach 
this approach provides a reasonable estimation of the value of the company and takes into consideration the company s thinly traded stock and concentrated holdings  market comparable valuations  and expected results of operations 
the resulting estimated fair value is then compared to its equity value 
on october  the step one assessment yielded the following fair value determined controlling minority interest value value a weighting contribution quoted stock price guideline companies discounted net cash flow concluded fair value a reflects application of the following control premiums for the quoted stock price approach  for guideline approach  and zero for the discounted net cash flow dcf approach 
guideline and dcf approaches also reflect addition of cash balance 
the concluded fair value exceeded the company s equity value as of october  by 
if the equity value exceeds the fair value in step one then step two estimates the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities including unrecognized intangible assets 
this value is then allocated among the assets and liabilities as if they had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value was the price paid 
we relied  in part  on certain assumptions in making the valuation conclusion 
if some or all of these assumptions change in the future  there may be a material impact on the valuation of the company  which may result in an additional impairment of goodwill 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the following we made certain assumptions in the calculation of discount rates  risk premiums  and capital structure weightings 
however  changes in capital markets may significantly change these assumptions in the future 
we used our knowledge of the business  industry and economy to assemble financial projections including our plans to expand our product offerings 
unforeseen events that dramatically change such influential factors as the economy  environment  and weather may positively or negatively affect the accuracy of these projections 
calculation of a control premium is a significant component in the assessment of goodwill 
this is a common valuation technique that relies on assumptions based on equity markets  credit markets and the merger and acquisition environment and the availability of buyers 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax basis 
the valuation of these deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on estimates that are dependent on rate and time assumptions 
if these estimates do not prove to be correct in the future  we may have over or understated income tax expense and  as a result  earnings 
financial accounting standards board fasb guidance clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company s financial statements 
the guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we lease various facilities and equipment under cancelable and non cancelable short and long term operating leases  which are described in item of this annual report on form k
