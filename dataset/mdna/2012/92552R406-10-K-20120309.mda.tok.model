mary lodge resort and denali backcountry lodge and denali cabins for million  million and million  respectively restructuring charges totaling million primarily related to reorganization activities in the marketing events group  comprised of the elimination of certain positions and facility consolidations income from discontinued operations of  related to the reversal of certain liabilities associated with previously sold operations cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  debt was million as of december  marketing events us revenues of million  an increase of percent from revenues segment operating loss of million  as compared to a loss of million in marketing events international revenues of million  an increase of percent from revenues segment operating income of million compared to million in 
table of contents travel recreation group revenues of million  an increase of percent from revenues segment operating income of million  as compared to million in non gaap measures the following discussion includes a presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses  which are utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of viad s operations and to facilitate period to period comparisons 
adjusted ebitda is defined by viad as net income attributable to viad before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations 
income before impairment losses is defined by viad as income from continuing operations before the after tax effect of impairment losses related to goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
the presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses is supplemental to results presented under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
adjusted ebitda is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes  depreciation  debt service costs  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated  thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of viad s ongoing operations 
income before impairment losses is utilized by management to review operating results of the business without the effects of non cash impairment losses 
these non gaap measures should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses provides useful information to investors regarding viad s results of operations for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of viad s business 
management uses adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses primarily as performance measures and believes that the gaap financial measures most directly comparable to these non gaap measures are net income attributable to viad and income from continuing operations attributable to viad  respectively 
although adjusted ebitda is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  the use of adjusted ebitda is limited because it does not consider material costs  expenses and other items necessary to operate the business 
these items include debt service costs  non cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long lived assets  expenses related to us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes  impairment losses or recoveries  and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations 
similarly  although income before impairment losses is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  its use is limited because it does not consider non cash goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived asset impairment losses 
because adjusted ebitda and income before impairment losses do not consider the above items  a user of viad s financial information should consider net income attributable to viad and income from continuing operations attributable to viad as important measures of financial performance because they provide more complete measures of the company s performance 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss attributable to viad is as follows in thousands adjusted ebitda impairment losses interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization income from discontinued operations net income loss attributable to viad the increase in adjusted ebitda of million from to was primarily due to higher segment operating results in the marketing events group 
the increase in adjusted ebitda of million from to was primarily driven by higher segment operating results at all operating segments and lower restructuring charges 
see results of operations below for a discussion of fluctuations

marketing events group 
revenues for the marketing events us segment were million for  up percent compared to million in the increase was primarily due to base same show revenue increases of percent  increased exhibitor spending  new business wins and positive show rotation of approximately million 
management defines base same show revenue as revenue from exhibitions and events that occur in the same quarter and same city every year 
base same shows represented percent of marketing events us segment revenues in the segment operating loss was million  compared to a loss of million in the improved operating results were primarily the result of higher revenues  partially offset by higher accruals for performance based incentives 
revenues for the marketing events international segment were million for  up percent compared to million in segment operating income was million in  compared to million in as discussed above  results in this segment were impacted by exchange rates during  resulting in increases of million in revenue and  in segment operating income  as compared to excluding exchange rate variances  revenues increased by million  or percent  and operating income increased by  or percent 
the increase in 
table of contents revenues was primarily due to new show wins  positive show rotation of approximately million and same show growth  which more than offset first quarter revenues from a major project for the winter olympic games in canada 
operating results for reflect higher compensation expenses  including merit increases and the elimination of temporary wage reductions  as compared to although the marketing events group has a diversified revenue base and long term contracts for future shows  its revenues are affected by general economic and industry specific conditions 
the prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows 
in general  the exhibition and event industry is experiencing modest improvement 
following quarterly declines from the third quarter of through the first quarter of  marketing events us base same show revenues were essentially flat in the second quarter and have increased in each of the following six quarters 
for  management expects us same show revenues to increase at a mid single digit rate and that show rotation will not have a meaningful impact on revenues as revenue from non annual shows during is expected to be comparable to revenues from non annual shows that took place during additionally  management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus will have an unfavorable impact on the marketing events group s revenues and operating income of approximately million and  respectively 
management remains focused on improving the profitability of the marketing events us segment through continued integration and consolidation of operations to increase capacity utilization and reduce costs 
consequently  management expects to record additional restructuring charges of approximately million in the first quarter of as a result of the continued reorganization activities 
additional restructuring charges may be incurred as further cost structure improvements are made 
the marketing events group is subject to multiple collective bargaining agreements that affect labor costs  about one third of which expire each year 
although labor relations between the company and labor are currently stable  disruptions during future contract negotiations could occur  with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of the marketing events group

mary lodge resort and grouse mountain lodge  which are located near glacier national park  as well as organic revenue growth at brewster 
the company acquired the room grouse mountain lodge on january  for million in cash and the room st 
mary lodge resort on june  for million in cash 
brewster realized growth across all of its lines of business with the exception of its transportation business  which had higher revenues resulting from charter contracts related to the winter olympic and paralympic games 
these improvements were partially offset by lower revenues from many glacier hotel  a property operated by glacier park  resulting from planned construction that reduced the number of rooms available during as compared to  as well as lower visitation to glacier national park during july and august 
excluding exchange rate variances  segment operating income decreased by million primarily due to the lower revenues at many glacier hotel which have a high flow through to operating income and the seasonal fourth quarter operating loss at alaskan park properties 
the company acquired the room denali backcountry lodge and denali cabins on september  for million in cash 
during  approximately percent of revenue and percent of segment operating income generated in the travel recreation group segment were derived through its canadian operations 
these operations are largely affected by foreign customer visitation  and  accordingly  increases in the value of the canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes  revenue and segment operating income for the travel recreation group 
management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus will have an unfavorable impact on travel recreation group segment revenues and operating income of approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  the travel recreation group segment is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities 
glacier park operates the concession portion of its business under a concession contract with the us national park service the park service for glacier national park

if a new concessionaire is selected by the park service  glacier park s remaining business would consist of its operations at waterton lakes national park  alberta  canada  east glacier  montana  whitefish  montana and st 
mary  montana 
in such a circumstance  glacier park would be entitled to an amount equal to its possessory interest  which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed  fixtures installed and improvements made to the concession property at glacier national park during the term of the concession contract

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions  proceedings and pending claims  some of which involve  or may involve  compensatory  punitive or other damages 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions  proceedings or claims could be decided against viad 
although the amount of liability as of december  with respect to these matters is not ascertainable  viad believes that any resulting liability  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage  will not have a material effect on viad s business  financial position or results of operations 

table of contents viad is subject to various us federal  state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which viad has or had operations 
if the company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations  civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders 
as is the case with many companies  viad also faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations 
although it is a party to certain environmental disputes  viad believes that any resulting liabilities  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for and insurance coverage  will not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
as of december   there was a remaining environmental remediation liability of million related to previously sold operations of which  is included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption other current liabilities and million under the caption other deferred items and liabilities 
viad s businesses contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering its union represented employees

based upon the information available to viad from plan administrators  management believes that several of these multi employer plans are underfunded 
the pension protection act of requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce  over defined time periods  the underfunded status 
in addition  under current laws  the termination of a plan  or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by viad  or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan  would require viad to make payments to such plan for its proportionate share of the plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
as of december   the amount of additional funding  if any  that viad would be required to make related to multi employer pension plans is not ascertainable 
off balance sheet arrangements viad does not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special purpose or other entities that would materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
furthermore  viad does not have any relationships with special purpose or other entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support  or engage in leasing or other services that may expose the company to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in viad s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on these criteria  viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to viad  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates goodwill goodwill is not amortized  but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on october of each year 
goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
viad s reporting units are defined  and goodwill is tested  at either an operating segment level or at the component level of an operating segment  depending on various factors including the internal reporting structure of the operating segment  the level of integration among components  the sharing of assets among components and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations 
as of december   viad had total goodwill of million consisting of million related to the marketing events group and million related to the travel recreation group 
within the marketing events group  goodwill of million relates to the marketing events us segment and million to the marketing events international segment 
for impairment testing purposes  the goodwill related to the marketing events us segment is assigned to and tested at the operating segment level  which represents all domestic operations of ges 
furthermore  the goodwill related to the marketing events international segment is assigned to and tested at the component level within the segment s geographical operations 
as of december   the amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting units in the united kingdom melville and canada was million and million  respectively 
also  as of december   the brewster  glacier park and alaskan park properties operating segments within the travel recreation group had goodwill of million  million and million acquired september  respectively 
brewster  glacier park and alaskan park properties are considered reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 

table of contents viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology income approach in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows  discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions  financial forecasts  industry trends and historical experience 
the most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital discount rate applied to those cash flows 
furthermore  the assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates discount rates are estimated using a build up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit 
in order to assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimates  the company performs a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to viad s market capitalization 
as noted above  the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows  discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions  financial forecasts  industry trends and historical experience 
these estimates  however  have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results 
as of december   viad had aggregate goodwill of million recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
furthermore  as a result of the company s most recent impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  the excess of the estimated fair values over the carrying values expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts under step one of the impairment test was percent  percent and percent for each of the marketing events group reporting units in the united states  the united kingdom melville and canada  respectively 
for the brewster and glacier park reporting units  the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was percent and percent  respectively  as of the most recent impairment test 
significant reductions in the company s expected future revenue  operating income or cash flow forecasts and projections  or an increase in reporting unit cost of capital  could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing  which may result in additional impairment losses 
furthermore  management continues to monitor the market capitalization of the company as ongoing declines in market capitalization could be indicative of possible goodwill impairment 
see results of operations above and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of goodwill impairment losses recorded during income taxes viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  the company must estimate its actual current income tax liability  and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
the company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
as of december  and  viad had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
these deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences  and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company considered all available positive and negative evidence regarding the future recoverability of its deferred tax assets  including the company s recent operating history and projected taxable income  taxpaying history and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities 
furthermore  viad also considered the fact that goodwill impairment losses are not tax deductible and thus did not contribute to tax losses 
as of december  and  viad had a valuation allowance of  and  respectively  related to certain state deferred tax assets 
with respect to all other deferred tax assets  management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more likely than not 
as noted above  viad uses considerable judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
as a result  there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets  which is primarily dependent on viad s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods 
in future periods  it is reasonably possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of viad s deferred tax assets may change  which could result in a material increase in the company s valuation allowance 
if such an increase in the valuation allowance were to occur  it would result in increased income tax expense in the period the assessment was made 
insurance liabilities viad is self insured up to certain limits for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability and property loss claims 
the aggregate amount of insurance liabilities related to viad s continuing operations was million as of december  of this total  million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining million related to general auto liability claims 
viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling million as of december   primarily related to workers compensation liabilities 
provisions for losses for claims incurred  including estimated claims incurred but not yet 
table of contents reported  are made based on viad s historical experience  claims frequency and other factors 
a change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities 
viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self insured levels  which generally range from  to  on a per claim basis 
viad does not maintain a self insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement 
viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
pension and postretirement benefits viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation 
funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
the company presently anticipates contributing million to its funded pension plans and  to its unfunded pension plans in viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees  retirees and dependents 
the related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses 
while the plans have no funding requirements  viad expects to contribute  to the plans in the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine percent  declining one half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine and one half percent  declining one half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  the weighted average assumptions used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december were as follows domestic plans postretirement funded plans unfunded plans benefit plans foreign plans discount rate the weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows domestic plans postretirement funded plans unfunded plans benefit plans foreign plans discount rate expected return on plan assets n a n a the discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review  and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high quality  hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments
