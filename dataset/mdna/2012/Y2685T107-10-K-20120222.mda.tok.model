item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a marshall islands company that transports iron ore  coal  grain  steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels 
excluding baltic trading  our fleet currently consists of nine capesize  eight panamax  supramax  six handymax and handysize drybulk carriers  with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately  dwt  and the average age of our fleet is currently years  as compared to the average age for the world fleet of approximately years for the drybulk shipping segments in which we compete 
most of the vessels in our fleet are on time charters to well known charterers  including lauritzen bulkers  cargill  pacbasin  trafigura  klaveness and swissmarine 
as of february   of the vessels in our fleet  excluding baltic trading  are presently engaged under time charter and spot market related time charter contracts that expire assuming the option periods in the time charters are not exercised between february and may  and five of our vessels are currently operating in vessel pools 
see pages for a table indicating the built dates of all vessels currently in our fleet 
in addition  baltic trading s fleet currently consists of two capesize  four supramax and three handysize drybulk carriers with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately  dwt 
depending on market conditions  we intend to acquire additional modern  high quality drybulk carriers through timely and selective acquisitions of vessels in a manner that is accretive to our cash flow 
in connection with the acquisitions made during through and our growth strategy  we negotiated the credit facility  million term loan facility  million term loan facility and the baltic trading credit facility each as defined herein that we have used to acquire vessels 
we expect to fund acquisitions of additional vessels using cash reserves set aside for this purpose  additional borrowings and may consider additional debt and equity financing alternatives from time to time 
on june   we entered into an agreement to purchase a total of eight handysize drybulk vessels  including five newbuildings  from companies within the metrostar management corporation group of companies metrostar for an aggregate purchase price of million 
five of these vessels are owned by us and three are owned by baltic trading 
additionally  on june   we entered into a master agreement with bourbon sa bourbon to purchase drybulk vessels  including two newbuildings  for an aggregate purchase price of million

georgiopoulos 
all eight vessels have been delivered from metrostar and all vessels have been delivered from bourbon  three of which were sold to mep 
in order to fund the acquisition of these vessels  we entered into two senior secured term loan facilities 
on august   we entered into a million senior secured term loan facility the million term loan facility to be utilized to fund or refund to us a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of five vessels from metrostar

strategic management includes locating  purchasing  financing and selling vessels 
we currently contract with three independent technical managers to provide technical management of our fleet at a lower cost than we believe would be possible in house 
technical management involves the day to day management of vessels  including performing routine maintenance  attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies 
members of our new york city based management team oversee the activities of our independent technical managers 
from time to time in the current global economic environment  our charterers with long term time charters may request to renegotiate the terms of our charters with them 
as a general matter  we do not agree to make changes to the terms of our charters in response to such requests 
the failure of any charterer to meet its obligations under our long term time charters could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

during the beginning of  the genco cavalier  a built supramax vessel  was on charter to samsun logix corporation samsun  when samsun filed for the equivalent of bankruptcy protection in south korea  otherwise referred to as a rehabilitation application 
on february   the rehabilitation plan submitted by samsun was approved by the south korean courts 
as part of the rehabilitation process  our claim of approximately million will be settled in the following manner  or approximately million  will be paid in cash in annual installments on december th of each year from through ranging in percentages from eight to  the remaining  or approximately million  converted to samsun shares at a specified value per share 
during the year ended december   we have recorded million as other operating income which represents the portion of the cash settlement that was due on december  during the year ended december   we have recorded million as other operating income which represents the portion of the cash settlement which was due on december  during january  the genco success  a built handymax vessel  was on charter to korea line corporation klc when klc filed for a rehabilitation application 
at december  and  we have limited exposure as a result of the bankruptcy protection filing by klc 
the vessel was redelivered to us by klc on january  we estimate that we have a claim of approximately million against klc related primarily to unpaid revenue earned prior to re delivery of the vessel 
if a rehabilitation plan is approved by the south korean courts and it is determined that we will receive a cash settlement for our outstanding claim  any amounts due from klc will be recorded once the collectibility of the receivable has been assessed and the amount has been deemed collectible 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  factors affecting our results of operations we believe that the following table reflects important measures for analyzing trends in our results of operations 
the table reflects our ownership days  available days  operating days  fleet utilization  tce rates and daily vessel operating expenses for the years ended december  and on a consolidated basis  which includes the operations of baltic trading

ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period 
we define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels 
companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues 
we define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to unforeseen circumstances 
the shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues 
we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period 
the shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the number of days that its vessels are off hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades  special surveys or vessel positioning 
we define tce rates as net voyage revenue voyage revenues less voyage expenses divided by the number of our available days during the period  which is consistent with industry standards 
tce rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters  because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts 
for the years ended december  voyage revenues in thousands voyage expenses in thousands total available days total tce rate we define daily vessel operating expenses to include crew wages and related costs  the cost of insurance  expenses relating to repairs and maintenance excluding drydocking  the costs of spares and consumable stores  tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses

results of operations voyage revenues our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet  the number of days during which our vessels operate and the amount of daily charterhire that our vessels earn  that  in turn  are affected by a number of factors  including the duration of our charters  our decisions relating to vessel acquisitions and disposals  the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels  the amount of time that our vessels spend in drydock undergoing repairs  maintenance and upgrade work  the age  condition and specifications of our vessels  levels of supply and demand in the drybulk shipping industry  and other factors affecting spot market charter rates for drybulk carriers 
during  voyage revenues decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenue was primarily a result of lower charter rates achieved by the majority of our vessels partially offset by the increase in the size of our fleet and an increase in revenues earned by baltic trading s vessels of million 
the average tce rate of our fleet decreased to  a day during from  during the decrease in tce rates resulted from lower charter rates achieved during versus for the majority of the vessels in our fleet 
during  the baltic dry index  or bdi a drybulk index went from a low of  on february  to a high of  on october  at december   the index was  in  the index started off at  on january  and decreased to a low of as of february  the bdi displayed considerable weakness in the beginning of due to reduced iron ore cargoes recorded through the celebration of the chinese new year  as well as a record level of newbuilding vessel deliveries for january  while continuous pressure was evident through august  primarily due to severe weather in brazil and australia affecting cargo availability 
a significant rebound was experienced in the remainder of the year with the bdi doubling in value during october has started much the same way as  with seasonal factors contributing to the most recent downturn in rates  including order timing issues for iron ore cargoes related to the celebration of the chinese new year  increased deliveries of newbuilding vessels for the month of january as compared to the previous three months  and short term weather related issues in brazil  temporarily reducing iron ore output 
given the fact that a majority of our vessels are chartered at spot market related rates  we expect that the recent downturn in rates will adversely impact our first quarter revenues and results of operation 
these adverse effects  taken together with potential similar impacts on our swap agreements  our investment in jinhui and other factors  may reduce our net current assets and equity in the first quarter of for and  we had ownership days of  days and  days  respectively 
the increase in ownership days is a result of the delivery of vessels during the third quarter of and four vessels during the year ended december   as well as a full year of ownership for baltic trading s fleet of nine vessels  which were acquired during our fleet utilization remained consistent during both periods at during as compared to during please see pages for table that sets forth information about the current employment of the vessels currently in our fleet as of february  service revenues service revenues consist of revenues earned from providing technical services to mep pursuant to the agency agreement between us and mep 
these services include oversight of crew management  insurance  drydocking  ship operations and financial statement preparation  but do not include chartering services 
the services are provided for a fee of per ship per day 
during the years ended december  and  total service revenue was million and million  respectively 
the increase is due to a full year of operation of mep s fleet during the year ended december  voyage expenses in time charters  spot market related time charters and pool agreements  operating costs including crews  maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel and specified voyage costs such as fuel and port charges are paid by the charterer 
there are certain other non specified voyage expenses such as commissions which are typically borne by us 
voyage expenses include port and canal charges  fuel bunker expenses and brokerage commissions payable to unaffiliated third parties 
port and canal charges and bunker expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on voyage charters because these expenses are for the account of the vessel owner 
at the inception of a time charter  we record the difference between the cost of bunker fuel delivered by the terminating charterer and the bunker fuel sold to the new charterer as a gain or loss within voyage expenses 
for and  voyage expenses remained relatively stable at million during both periods and consisted primarily of brokerage commissions paid to third parties 
vessel operating expenses vessel operating expenses increased by million from million to million primarily due to the operation of a larger fleet 
this was primarily a result of the full year of operation of the vessels which were delivered during the third quarter of as well as the operation of four vessels delivered during the year ended december  additionally  the increase was due to a full year of operation of baltic trading s fleet of vessels that were acquired during  which accounted for million of additional vessel operating expenses during as compared to the prior year 
the increase was also related to higher crew expenses  partially offset by lower insurance and lube expenses during as compared to average daily vessel operating expenses for our fleet decreased by per day from  during as compared to  in the decrease in daily vessel operating expenses was due to a decrease in lube and insurance related expenses 
we believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation 
our vessel operating expenses  which generally represent fixed costs  will increase as a result of the expansion of our fleet 
other factors beyond our control  some of which may affect the shipping industry in general  including  for instance  developments relating to market prices for crewing  lubes  and insurance  may also cause these expenses to increase

additionally  we incur management fees to third party technical management companies for the day to day management of our vessels  including performing routine maintenance  attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies 
general  administrative and management fees increased by million during as compared to the increase in general and administrative fees was primarily due to rent expense associated with the lease for the new office space which began effective june  as well as an increase in employee stock based compensation 
this increase was also due to the increase in expenses associated with the operation of baltic trading  which resulted in million of additional expenses

during  the management fees per vessel are expected to be the same as during  or approximately million per vessel 
depreciation and amortization we depreciate the cost of our vessels on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel 
depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value 
we estimate the useful life of our vessels to be years 
furthermore  we estimate the residual values of our vessels to be based upon the estimated scrap value of the vessels 
effective january   we increased the estimated scrap value of the vessels from lwt to lwt prospectively based on the year average scrap value of steel 
depreciation and amortization charges increased by million during as compared to due to the operation of a larger fleet  including the vessels delivered during the third quarter of and four vessels delivered during as well as the nine baltic trading vessels delivered during the year ended december   which accounted for million of the increase

average consolidated net indebtedness is the monthly average of our indebtedness as defined under the facilities  which at december  consisted of long term debt  the notes  cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash and the letter of credit issued related to leases 
on december   we entered agreements which waived the existing maximum leverage ratio covenant  as well as the consolidated interest ratio  for the three aforementioned credit facilities for a period beginning on october  and ending on and including march  pursuant to the current terms of the credit facility  the existing collateral maintenance financial covenant is waived  which required us to maintain pledged vessels with a value equal to at least of our current borrowings  and accelerated the reductions of the total facility which began on march  please read the description of the credit facility in note long term debt of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
the collateral maintenance covenant is waived until we can represent that we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
under the collateral maintenance covenants of our million term loan facility  our million term loan facility  and the baltic trading credit facility  the aggregate valuations of our vessels pledged under each facility must at least be a certain percentage of loans outstanding or  in the case of the baltic trading credit facility  the total amount we may borrow  which percentages are   and  respectively 
under our million term loan facility  the amount payable upon early termination of any interest rate swaps under the facility is added to outstanding loans for purposes of this covenant 
if our valuations fall below the applicable percentage  we must provide additional acceptable collateral  repay a portion of our borrowings  or in the case of the baltic trading credit facility permanently reduce the amount we may borrow under the facility to the extent required to restore our compliance with the applicable covenant 
dividend policy historically  our dividend policy  which commenced in november  has been to declare quarterly distributions to shareholders by each february  may  august and november  substantially equal to our available cash from operations during the previous quarter  less cash expenses for that quarter principally vessel operating expenses and debt service and any reserves our board of directors determines we should maintain 
these reserves covered  among other things  drydocking  repairs  claims  liabilities and other obligations  interest expense and debt amortization  acquisitions of additional assets and working capital 
in the future  we may incur other expenses or liabilities that would reduce or eliminate the cash available for distribution as dividends 
under the current terms of the credit facility  we are required to suspend the payment of cash dividends until we can represent that we are in a position to satisfy the collateral maintenance covenant 
refer to note long term debt in our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the amendment 
as such  a dividend has not been declared during  and as a result of the amendment to the credit facility  we have suspended the payment of cash dividends effective for the fourth quarter of  and payment of cash dividends will remain suspended until we can meet the collateral maintenance covenant contained in the credit facility 
in addition  under the terms of the december agreements  we are prohibited from paying dividends through march  the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and our compliance with the collateral maintenance covenant  which is currently waived 
the timing and amount of dividend payments will depend on our earnings  financial condition  cash requirements and availability  fleet renewal and expansion  restrictions in our loan agreements  the provisions of marshall islands law affecting the payment of distributions to shareholders and other factors 
our board of directors may review and amend our dividend policy from time to time in light of our plans for future growth and other factors 
we believe that  under current law  our dividend payments from earnings and profits will constitute qualified dividend income and  as such  will generally be subject to a us federal income tax rate with respect to non corporate us shareholders that meet certain holding period and other requirements through 
distributions in excess of our earnings and profits will be treated first as a non taxable return of capital to the extent of a us shareholder s tax basis in its common stock on a dollar for dollar basis and  thereafter  as capital gain 
share repurchase program on february   our board of directors approved our share repurchase program for up to a total of million of our common stock 
share repurchases will be made from time to time for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and amount of purchases under the program were determined by management based upon market conditions and other factors 
purchases may be made pursuant to a program adopted under rule b under the securities exchange act 
the program does not require us to purchase any specific number or amount of shares and may be suspended or reinstated at any time in our discretion and without notice 
repurchases under the program are subject to restrictions under the credit facility 
the credit facility was amended as of february  to permit the share repurchase program and provide that the dollar amount of shares repurchased is counted toward the maximum dollar amount of dividends that may be paid in any fiscal quarter 
subsequently  on january   we entered into the amendment  which amended the credit facility to require us to suspend all share repurchases until we can represent that we are in a position to again satisfy the collateral maintenance covenant 
refer to note long term debt in our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the amendment 
pursuant to the amendment  there were no share repurchases made during the twelve months ended december  and in addition  under the terms of the december agreements  we are prohibited from making share repurchases through march  since the inception of the share repurchase program through december   we have repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock for million average per share purchase price of using funding from cash generated from operations pursuant to its share repurchase program 
an additional  shares of common stock were repurchased from employees for million during pursuant to our equity incentive plan rather than the share repurchase program 
no share repurchases were made during the years ended december  and  and the maximum dollar amount that may yet be purchased under our share repurchase program is  cash flow net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower net income for the twelve months of  which resulted primarily from lower charter rates achieved in versus the prior year for the majority of the vessels in our fleet 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   the cash flow impact of the lower net income was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization due to the operation of a larger fleet 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to fewer funds used for deposits and purchases of vessels during compared to for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities primarily related to the purchase of vessels in the amount of million 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities primarily related to purchases of vessels in the amount of million and deposits on vessels in the amount of million 
this was partially offset by proceeds of million related to the back to back sale of three vessels to maritime equity partners llc 
net cash used in financing activities was million during the year ended december  as compared to million in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  cash used in financing activities in mainly consisted of the following million repayment of debt under the credit facility  million repayment of debt under the million term loan facility  million repayment of debt under the million term loan facility  million for payments of deferred financing costs and the million dividend payments of our subsidiary  baltic trading limited  to its outside shareholders 
those uses were partially offset by million of proceeds from the million term loan facility related to the bourbon vessels acquired and million of proceeds from the million term loan facility 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities consisted of million of proceeds from the million term loan facility  million of proceeds from the million term loan facility  million of proceeds from the initial public offering of baltic trading limited  million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes  million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and million of proceeds from the baltic trading credit facility  partially offset by repayments on the credit facility of million  million repayment of debt under the million term loan facility  million repayment of debt under the million term loan facility  million for payments of common stock issuance costs  million for payments of deferred financing costs and the million dividend payment of our subsidiary  baltic trading limited  to its outside shareholders

interest rate swap agreements  forward freight agreements and currency swap agreements at december   we have eight interest rate swap agreements with dnb nor bank to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates 
the total notional principal amount of the swaps is million and the swaps have specified rates and durations 
refer to the table in note long term debt of our consolidated financial statements  which summarizes the interest rate swaps in place as of december  and we have considered the creditworthiness of both ourselves and the counterparty in determining the fair value of the interest rate derivatives  and such consideration resulted in an immaterial adjustment to the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet 
valuations prior to any adjustments for credit risk are validated by comparison with counterparty valuations 
amounts are not and should not be identical due to the different modeling assumptions 
any material differences are investigated 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into arrangements commonly known as forward freight agreements  or ffas  to hedge and manage market risks relating to the deployment of our existing fleet of vessels 
these arrangements may include future contracts  or commitments to perform in the future a shipping service between ship owners  charters and traders 
generally  these arrangements would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified tonnage freighting commitment forward at an agreed time and price and for a particular route 
although ffas can be entered into for a variety of purposes  including for hedging  as an option  for trading or for arbitrage  if we decided to enter into ffas  our objective would be to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management 
it is not currently our intention to enter into ffas to generate a stream of income independent of the revenues we derive from the operation of our fleet of vessels 
if we determine to enter into ffas  we may reduce our exposure to any declines in our results from operations due to weak market conditions or downturns  but may also limit our ability to benefit economically during periods of strong demand in the market

these fees were included in the amendment to the credit facility entered into effective december  refer to note long term debt in our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this amendment 
capital expenditures we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with our vessel acquisitions 
excluding baltic trading s vessels  our fleet currently consists of nine capesize drybulk carriers  eight panamax drybulk carriers  supramax drybulk carriers  six handymax drybulk carriers and handysize drybulk carriers 
baltic trading s fleet currently consists of two capesize drybulk carriers  four supramax drybulk carriers and three handysize drybulk carriers 
in addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods  we will incur additional capital expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings 
we estimate our drydocking costs and scheduled off hire days for our fleet through to be year estimated drydocking cost estimated off hire days us dollars in millions the costs reflected are estimates based on drydocking our vessels in china 
we estimate that each drydock will result in days of off hire 
actual costs will vary based on various factors  including where the drydockings are actually performed 
we expect to fund these costs with cash from operations 
during  we incurred a total of million of drydocking costs 
during  we incurred a total of million of drydocking costs 
we estimate that of our vessels will be drydocked during and an additional vessels in off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
inflation inflation has only a moderate effect on our expenses given current economic conditions 
in the event that significant global inflationary pressures appear  these pressures would increase our operating  voyage  general and administrative  and financing costs 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies  because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application 
for an additional description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this k 
time charters acquired when a vessel is acquired with an existing time charter  we allocate the purchase price of the vessel and the time charter based on  among other things  vessel market valuations and the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired charters of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the charter terms and ii management s estimate of the fair market charter rate  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the charter 
the capitalized above market assets and below market liabilities charters are amortized as a reduction or increase  respectively  to voyage revenues over the remaining term of the charter 
during the year ended december   we acquired two handysize vessels from metrostar that had existing below market time charters at the time that we agreed to acquire these vessels 
we recorded a liability for time charters acquired related to these two vessels in the amount of million based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid and our estimated of the fair market charter rate 
in order to calculate the present value  we utilized a discount rate of 
if we utilized a discount rate of as compared to  it would result in an increase in the liability balance of approximately nine thousand dollars 
if we utilized a discount rate of as compared to  it would result in a decrease in the liability balance of approximately nine thousand dollars 
during the year ended december   we acquired two supramax vessels from bourbon and two handysize vessels from metrostar that had existing below market time charters at the time that we agreed to acquire these vessels 
we recorded a liability for time charters acquired related to these five vessels in the amount of million based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid and our estimate of the fair market charter rate 
in order to calculate the present value  we utilized a discount rate of 
if we utilized a discount rate of as compared to  it would result in an increase in the liability balance of approximately thirty five thousand dollars 
if we utilized a discount rate of as compared to  it would result in a decrease in the liability balance of approximately thirty three thousand dollars 
performance claims revenue is based on contracted charterparties  including spot market related time charters which rates fluctuate based on changes in the spot market 
however  there is always the possibility of dispute over terms and payment of hires and freights 
in particular  disagreements may arise as to the responsibility of lost time and revenue due to us as a result 
additionally  there are certain performance parameters included in contracted charterparties which if not met  can result in customer claims 
accordingly  we periodically assess the recoverability of amounts outstanding and estimate a provision if there is a possibility of non recoverability 
at each balance sheet date  we provide a provision based on a review of all outstanding charter receivables and we also will accrue for any estimated customer claims primarily a result of time charter performance issues that have not yet been deducted by the charterer 
we provide for reserves which offset the due from charterers balance if a disputed amount or performance claim has been deducted by the charterer 
if a disputed amount or potential performance claim has not been deducted by the charterer  we record the estimated customer claims as deferred revenue 
providing for these reserves will be offset by a decrease in revenue 
although we believe its provisions to be reasonable at the time they are made  it is possible that an amount under dispute is not ultimately recovered and the estimated provision for doubtful accounts is inadequate 
vessels and depreciation we record the value of our vessels at their cost which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage less accumulated depreciation 
we depreciate our drybulk vessels on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value 
effective january   we increased the estimated scrap value of the vessels from lwt to lwt prospectively based on the year average scrap value of steel 
this increase in the residual value of the vessels will decrease the annual depreciation charge over the remaining useful life of the vessel 
during the year ended december   the increase in the estimated scrap value resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million 
similarly  an increase in the useful life of a drybulk vessel would also decrease the annual depreciation charge 
comparatively  a decrease in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
however  when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis  we will adjust the vessel s useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel s further commercial use 
the carrying value each of our vessels does not represent the fair market value of such vessel or the amount we could obtain if we were to sell any of our vessels  which could be more or less 
under us gaap  we would not record a loss if the fair market value of a vessel excluding its charter is below our carrying value unless and until we determine to sell that vessel or the vessel is impaired as discussed below under impairment of long lived assets 
excluding the three bourbon vessels we resold immediately upon delivery to mep at our cost  we have sold three of our vessels since our inception and realized a profit in each instance 
however  we did determine to cancel an acquisition of six drybulk newbuildings in november  incurring a million loss from the forfeiture of our deposit and related interest 
pursuant to our bank credit facilities  we regularly submit to the lenders valuations of our vessels on an individual charter free basis in order to evidence our compliance with the collateral maintenance covenants under our bank credit facilities 
such a valuation is not necessarily the same as the amount any vessel may bring upon sale  which may be more or less  and should not be relied upon as such 
we were in compliance with the collateral maintenance covenants under our million term loan facility and our million term loan facility  as well as the baltic trading credit facility  at december   and the collateral maintenance covenant under our credit facility was waived at december   as discussed above 
in the chart below  we list each of our vessels  the year it was built  the year we acquired it  and its carrying value at december  at december   the vessel valuations of all of our vessels for covenant compliance purposes under our bank credit facilities as of the most recent compliance testing date were lower than their carrying values at december  for the genco ocean  genco bay  genco avra and genco spirit  the last compliance testing date prior to december  was august   in accordance with the terms of the million term loan facility  for all other vessels  the compliance testing date was december   in accordance with the terms of the applicable credit facility 
the amount by which the carrying value at december  of all of the vessels in our fleet exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliance purposes ranged  on an individual vessel basis  from million to million per vessel 
the average amount by which the carrying value of these vessels exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliance purposes was million 
however  neither such valuation nor the carrying value in the table below reflects the value of long term time charters related to some of our vessels  which can be significant

we capitalize the costs associated with drydockings as they occur and amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings 
deferred drydocking costs include actual costs incurred at the drydock yard  cost of travel  lodging and subsistence of our personnel sent to the drydocking site to supervise  and the cost of hiring a third party to oversee the drydocking 
we believe that these criteria are consistent with us gaap guidelines and industry practice and that our policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of the vessels 
costs that are not related to drydocking are expensed as incurred 
if the vessel is drydocked earlier than originally anticipated  any remaining deferred drydock costs that have not been amortized are expensed at the beginning of the next drydock 
impairment of long lived assets we follow the accounting standards codification asc subtopic  property  plant and equipment asc which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts 
if indicators of impairment are present  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to be derived from the related long lived assets 
the current economic and market conditions  including the significant disruptions in the global credit markets  are having broad effects on participants in a wide variety of industries 
since mid august  the charter rates in the dry bulk charter market have declined significantly  and drybulk vessel values have also declined both as a result of a slowdown in the availability of global credit and the significant deterioration in charter rates 
when indicators of impairment are present and our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows for any vessel is lower than the vessel s carrying value  the carrying value is written down  by recording a charge to operations  to the vessel s fair market value if the fair market value is lower than the vessel s carrying value 
we noted that tce revenues across its fleet were lower on average in compared with our management views the lower tce rates in as part of a longer term economic cycle 
we concluded at december  that the future income streams expected to be earned by such vessels over their remaining operating lives on an undiscounted basis would be sufficient to recover their carrying values and that  accordingly  our vessels were not impaired under us gaap 
our estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded each of our vessels carrying values by a considerable margin of carrying value 
our vessels remain fully utilized and have a relatively long average remaining useful life of approximately years in which to recover sufficient cash flows on an undiscounted basis to recover their carrying values as of december  management will continue to monitor developments in charter rates in the markets in which it participates with respect to the expectation of future rates over an extended period of time that are utilized in the analyses 
in developing estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  we make assumptions and estimates about the vessels future performance  with the significant assumptions being related to charter rates  fleet utilization  vessels operating expenses  vessels capital expenditures and drydocking requirements  vessels residual value and the estimated remaining useful life of each vessel 
the assumptions used to develop estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are based on historical trends 
specifically  we utilize the rates currently in effect for the duration of their current time charters  without assuming additional profit sharing 
for periods of time where our vessels are not fixed on time charters  we utilize an estimated daily time charter equivalent for our vessels unfixed days based on the most recent ten year historical one year time charter average 
actual equivalent drybulk shipping rates are currently lower than the estimated rate 
we believe current rates have been driven by short term disruptions or seasonal issues as discussed under management s discussion and analysis results of operations voyage revenues 
the projected net operating cash flows are determined by considering the future charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days and an estimated daily time charter equivalent for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining life of the vessel  assumed to be years from the delivery of the vessel from the shipyard  reduced by brokerage commissions  expected outflows for vessels maintenance and vessel operating expenses including planned drydocking and special survey expenditures and capital expenditures adjusted annually for inflation  assuming fleet utilization of 
the salvage value used in the impairment test is estimated to be per light weight ton  consistent with our vessels depreciation policy discussed above 
although we believe that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
there can be no assurance as to how long charter rates and vessel values will remain at their currently low levels or whether they will improve by any significant degree 
charter rates may remain at depressed levels for some time  which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability  and future assessments of vessel impairment 
investments we hold an investment in the capital stock of jinhui shipping and transportation limited jinhui 
jinhui is a drybulk shipping owner and operator focused on the supramax segment of drybulk shipping 
this investment is designated as available for sale and is reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in shareholders equity as a component of aoci 
we classify the investment as a current or noncurrent asset based on our intent to hold the investment at each reporting date 
investments are reviewed quarterly to identify possible other than temporary impairment in accordance asc subtopic  investments debt and equity securities asc 
when evaluating the investments  we review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below the cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer  the underlying net asset value of the issuer s assets and liabilities  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value 
should the decline in the value of any investment be deemed to be other than temporary  the investment basis would be written down to fair market value  and the write down would be recorded to earnings as a loss 
investments that are not expected to be sold within the next year are classified as noncurrent 
during the fourth quarter of  our investment in jinhui was deemed to be other than temporarily impaired due to the severity of the decline in its market value versus our cost basis 
we recorded a million impairment loss during which was reclassified from the statement of equity and recorded as a loss in the income statement 
we will continue to evaluate the investment on a quarterly basis to determine the likelihood of any further significant adverse effects on the fair value and amount of any additional impairment 
in the event we determine that the jinhui investment is subject to any additional other than temporary impairment  the amount of the impairment would be reclassified from the statement of equity and recorded as a loss in the income statement for the amount of the impairment 
fair value of financial instruments the estimated fair values of our financial instruments such as amounts due to due from charterers  accounts payable and long term debt approximate their individual carrying amounts as of december  and december  due to their short term maturity or the variable rate nature of the respective borrowings under the credit facilities 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount we would receive to terminate these agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and creditworthiness of us for liabilities 
see note fair value of financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on the fair values of long term debt  derivative instruments  notes and available for sale securities 
for the interest rate swaps that are not designated as an effective hedge  the change in the value and the rate differential to be paid or received is recognized as other expense and is listed as a component of other expense income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flow in relation to our borrowings 
we held eight and ten interest rate swap agreements with dnb nor bank at december  and  respectively  to manage future interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates 
the total notional principal amount of the swaps is million and million  respectively  and the swaps have specified rates and durations 
refer to the table in note interest rate swap agreements of our consolidated financial statements which summarizes the interest rate swaps in place as of december  and the swap agreements  with effective dates prior to december  synthetically convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at the fixed interest rate of swap plus the applicable margin as discussed in the credit facility section of note long term debt of our consolidated financial statements 
the total liability associated with the swaps at december  is million and million at december   and are presented as the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet 
as of december  and  we have accumulated other comprehensive deficit of million and million  respectively  related to the effectively hedged portion of the swaps 
hedge ineffectiveness associated with the interest rate swaps resulted in other income expense of million and during and at december   million of aoci is expected to be reclassified into income over the next months associated with interest rate derivatives 
we are subject to market risks relating to changes in libor rates because we have significant amounts of floating rate debt outstanding 
for the year ended december   we paid libor plus on the credit facility for the debt in excess of any designated swap s notional amount for such swap s effective period 
effective december   we are also subject to a facility fee of per annum on the average daily outstanding principal amount of the outstanding loan under the credit facility pursuant to the amendment entered into with our lenders under this facility which will be reduced to if we consummate an equity offering resulting in an aggregate amount million of gross proceeds 
we also paid libor plus on the outstanding debt under the million term loan facility  million term loan facility and the baltic trading credit facility 
a increase in libor would result in an increase of million in interest expense for the year ended december   considering the increase would be only on the unhedged portion of the debt 
derivative financial instruments as of december   we held eight interest rate swap agreements that we entered into with dnb nor bank to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates 
the total notional principal amount of the swaps is million  and the swaps have specified rates and durations 
refer to the table in note long term debt of our consolidated financial statements which summarized the interest rate swaps in place as of december  and december  the differential to be paid or received for these swap agreements is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as incurred 
the interest rate differential pertaining to the interest rate swaps for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
we are currently utilizing cash flow hedge accounting for the swaps whereby the effective portion of the change in value of the swaps is reflected as a component of aoci 
the ineffective portion is recognized as other expense income  which is a component of other expense income 
if for any period of time we did not designate the swaps for hedge accounting  the change in the value of the swap agreements prior to designation would be recognized as other expense income 
amounts receivable or payable arising at the settlement of hedged interest rate swaps are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period of interest rate exposure provided the designated liability continues to exist 
amounts receivable or payable arising at the settlement of unhedged interest rate swaps are reflected as other expense income and are listed as a component of other expense income 
refer to the interest rate risk section above for further information regarding the interest rate swap agreements 
currency and exchange rate risk the international shipping industry s functional currency is the us dollar 
virtually all of our revenues and most of our operating costs are in us dollars 
we incur certain operating expenses in currencies other than the us dollar  and the foreign exchange risk associated with these operating expenses is immaterial 
as part of our business strategy  in the future  we may enter into short term forward currency contracts to protect ourselves from the risk arising from the fluctuation in the exchange rate associated with the cost basis of jinhui shares 
investments we hold investments in jinhui of million which are classified as available for sale afs under accounting standards codification  investments debt and equity securities asc 
the investment is classified as a current or noncurrent asset based on our intent to hold the investment at each reporting date 
the investments that are classified as afs are subject to risk of changes in market value  which if determined to be impaired other than temporarily impaired  could result in realized impairment losses 
we review the carrying value of such investments on a quarterly basis to determine if any valuation adjustments are appropriate under asc during  we reviewed the investment in jinhui for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination required significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we evaluated  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than its cost  the general market conditions  including factors such as industry and sector performance  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
our investment in jinhui was deemed to be other than temporarily impaired at december  due to the severity of the decline in its market value versus our cost basis 
we will continue to evaluate the investment on a quarterly basis to determine the likelihood of any further significant adverse effects on the fair value and amount of any additional impairment 
for the years ended december  and  we have not deemed our investment to be impaired 
in the event we determine that the jinhui investment is subject to any additional impairment  the amount of the impairment would be reclassified from aoci and recorded as a loss in the consolidated statement of operations for the amount of the impairment
