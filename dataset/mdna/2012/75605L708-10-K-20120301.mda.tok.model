in addition  pricing for our intercarrier messaging services is changing to fixed price structures 
in our games segment  consumer s game play is shifting from downloadable pcs games to social networks and mobile devices  and in  we focused on developing social games and monetizing social game play experiences 
however  the revenue we generated from social games in did not offset the declines in revenue from sales of pc games and online game subscriptions 
in and continuing into  we implemented a restructuring of our business  which included deconsolidating our rhapsody joint venture from our financial statements as of march   and other significant internal restructuring measures such as reductions in personnel and facilities and the discontinuance or de emphasis of certain unprofitable products and service offerings

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information

for the year ended december   the estimated loss on excess office facilities including the write down of leasehold improvements was approximately million 
our estimates are based upon many factors including projections of sublease rates and the time period required to locate tenants

income taxes during the years ended december    and  we recognized income tax benefits of million and million  and income tax expense of million  respectively  related to us and foreign income taxes

the income tax expense in was primarily the result of impairments of long lived assets and changes in our valuation allowance 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered based upon our consideration of many factors  including the current economic climate  our expectations of future taxable income  our ability to project such income  and the appreciation of our investments and other assets 
during the year ended december   we released million of our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets relate primarily to capital loss carryforwards  and net operating loss carryforwards which we determined  in accordance with fasb asc  accounting for income taxes  we will more likely than not be able to utilize due to the generation of sufficient taxable income in the future from the transaction with intel described above 
of the 
table of contents total valuation allowance release  million was recorded as an income tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a partial valuation allowance of million for our deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding their realization as of december  adjustments could be required in the future if we estimate that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is more or less than the net amount we have recorded 
any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance could have the effect of increasing or decreasing the income tax provision in the statement of operations 
we generate income in a number of foreign jurisdictions  some of which have higher tax rates and some of which have lower tax rates relative to the us federal statutory rate 
changes to the blend of income between jurisdictions with higher or lower effective tax rates than the us federal statutory rate could affect our effective tax rate 
for the year ended december   decreases in tax expense from income generated in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates in comparison to the us federal statutory rate was offset by increases in tax expense from income generated in foreign jurisdictions having comparable  or higher tax rates in comparison to the us federal statutory rate 
as such  the effect of differences in foreign tax rates on the company s tax expense for the year ended december  is minimal 
in the fourth quarter of  we received a cash payment of approximately million and in the third quarter of we received a cash payment of approximately million  as the result of a refund of us federal taxes previously paid

the remaining million in refunds related to net operating loss carrybacks and prior year tax overpayments 
we recorded the related income tax benefit and tax receivable for both the and refunds in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as of december  and december   gross unrecognized tax benefits were million and million  respectively 
of the increase  million is due to transfer pricing risk in foreign jurisdictions and million is related to other prior year positions  partially offset by a decrease of million related to the closure of a foreign subsidiary which had reserves related to transfer pricing and the expiration of the statute of limitations on state tax returns 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate if recognized is million as of december   and million as of december  we currently anticipate the closure of foreign income tax examinations in the next twelve months that may decrease our total unrecognized tax benefits by an amount up to million as a result of the successful defense of our positions  the settlement and payment of a liability  or a combination thereof 
additionally  we anticipate that our total unrecognized tax benefits may increase by an amount up to million as a result of a potential transfer pricing change 
we estimate the impact of uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the consolidated financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return 
we file numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the united states including federal  state and local  as well as foreign jurisdictions

purchases  net of sales and maturities  of short term investments provided cash of million during in the year ended december   investing activities provided cash primarily from the sales and maturities  net of purchases  of short term investments of approximately million 
uses of cash during included the purchases of equipment  software and leasehold improvements of million and the payment of acquisition costs of million primarily related to the payment of anniversary and performance costs relating to the acquisition of zylom  which were previously accrued 
financing activities in the year ended december  used cash mainly from the payment of the special dividend to the holders of our common stock of million in the third quarter 
the payment of the special dividend was based on an analysis of realnetworks capital structure and the belief that we had excess cash relative to our future operational or strategic needs 
financing activities in the year ended december  provided cash from the proceeds of sales of common stock under employee stock purchase plans and the exercise of stock options of million 
financing activities provided cash from the proceeds of sales of interests in rhapsody of million as well as sales of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options of million in the year ended december  the declaration and payment of future dividends  as well as the amount thereof  are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  capital levels  cash requirements  future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends in the future 
we currently have no planned significant capital expenditures for other than those in the ordinary course of business 
in the future  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity financing  or through other sources such as credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  in the future  we may enter into cash or stock acquisition transactions or other strategic transactions that could reduce cash available to fund our operations or result in dilution to shareholders 

table of contents our principal future cash commitments include office leases and contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement with intel corporation pursuant to which we will sell certain patent assets and related rights held by us and our next generation video codec technology for million and the assumption of certain liabilities  subject to potential adjustments 
we intend to hold the cash proceeds we will receive in the us in connection with the transaction  we also entered into a license agreement with intel in which we will obtain a non exclusive  royalty free  fully paid up  irrevocable and worldwide license to use the patents assets we will sell to intel in connection with our businesses 
the consummation of these transactions is subject to closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity securities in our short term investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one non us government or non us agency issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates on the securities in this portfolio 
we conduct our operations primarily in five functional currencies the us dollar  the korean won  the japanese yen  the british pound and the euro 
historically  neither fluctuations in foreign exchange rates nor changes in foreign economic conditions have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  we currently do not hedge the majority of our foreign currency exposures and are therefore subject to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
we invoice our international customers primarily in us dollars  except in korea  japan  germany  france  the united kingdom and australia  where we invoice our customers primarily in the respective local currencies 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from intercompany payables and receivables to and from our foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   approximately million of the million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we have reviewed each of our foreign subsidiaries and as of december  have repatriated approximately million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries 
the company believes repatriation of these earnings will result in additional taxes of approximately million and has provided for that amount in the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we currently have significant net operating losses and other tax attributes that will be used to offset the million of additional taxes  and as a result  the repatriation did not have a material impact on our tax expense for the year ended december  as we are utilizing net operating losses  which had a full valuation allowance 
as of december   we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  since such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these amounts were distributed to the u 
s  in the future in the form of dividends or otherwise  we could be subject to additional us income taxes 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability or benefit on such earnings due to the timing of such future distributions  the availability of foreign tax credits  and the complexity of the computation if such earnings were not deemed to be permanently reinvested 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital  and long term investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be repatriated  an additional provision for us income and foreign withholding taxes  net of foreign tax credits  may be necessary 
at december   we had commitments to make the following payments contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands office leases other contractual obligations total contractual cash obligations other contractual obligations primarily relate to minimum contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fasb asc previously fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments for such liability 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements our only significant off balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease obligations for office facility leases and other contractual obligations related primarily to minimum contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
future annual minimum rental lease payments and other contractual obligations are included in the commitment schedule above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows revenue recognition  estimating music publishing rights and music royalties  estimating recoverability of deferred costs  estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  estimating losses on excess office facilities  valuation of equity method investments  valuation of available for sale securities  valuation of long lived assets  valuation of goodwill  stock based compensation  
table of contents accounting for gains on sale of subsidiary stock  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
physical products are considered delivered to the customer once they have been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for online sales  the products or services are considered delivered at the time the product or services are made available  digitally  to the end user 
we recognize revenue on a gross or net basis 
in most arrangements  we contract directly with end user customers  are the primary obligor and carry all collectability risk 
in such arrangements  we recognize revenue on a gross basis 
in some cases  we utilize third party distributors to sell products or services directly to end user customers and carry no collectability risk 
in such instances  we recognize revenue on a net basis 
in our direct to consumer business segments  we derive revenue through subscriptions of superpass within our core products segment and subscriptions sold by our games segment  sales of content downloads  software and licenses offered by our core products  emerging products and games segments and the sale of advertising and the distribution of third party products on our websites and in our games 
prior to april   our direct to consumer business also included the products and services offered by our music segment  which was primarily sold by the rhapsody joint venture and included in our music segment 
beginning on april   revenue from the rhapsody joint venture is no longer consolidated within our financial statements 
we now report our share of rhapsody s net income or losses as equity in net loss of rhapsody and other equity method investments 
consumer subscription products are paid in advance  typically for monthly  quarterly or annual duration 
subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the related subscription time period 
revenue from sales of content downloads  software and licenses is recognized at the time the product is made available  digitally  to the end user 
revenue generated from advertising on our websites and from advertising and the distribution of third party products included in our products is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery 
we also generate revenue through business to business channels by providing services within our core products segment enabling mobile carriers to deliver audio and video content to their customers and by selling software licenses and products and related support and other services 
revenue generated from services provided to mobile carriers that enable the delivery of audio and video content to their customers is recognized as the services are provided 
setup fees to build these services are recognized ratably upon launch of the service over the remaining expected term of the service 
non software revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units and revenue is allocated using estimated selling prices if the company does not have vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling prices of the deliverables 
a portion of the revenue related to the sale of software licenses and products and related support and other services is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including  in some cases  post delivery support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements on a when and if available basis 
unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the related products contract term 
estimating music publishing rights and music royalty accruals 
we must make estimates of amounts owed related to our music publishing rights and music royalties for our domestic and international music services primarily incurred by rhapsody which was separated from our operating results beginning april  unsettled obligations incurred prior to april  remain our liability 
material differences may impact the amount and timing of our expense for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
under copyright law  we may be required to pay licensing fees for digital sound recordings and compositions we deliver 
copyright law generally does not specify the rate and terms of the licenses  which are determined by voluntary negotiations among the parties or  for certain compulsory licenses where voluntary negotiations are unsuccessful  by arbitration 
there are certain geographies and agencies for which we have not yet completed negotiations with regard to the royalty rate to be applied to the current or historic sales of our digital music offerings 
our estimates are based on contracted or statutory rates  when established  or management s best estimates based on facts and circumstances regarding the specific music services and agreements in similar geographies or with similar agencies 
while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
estimating recoverability of deferred costs 
we defer costs on projects for service revenue and system sales 
deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems  as defined in individual customer contracts  including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties 

table of contents we recognize such costs as a component of cost of revenue  the timing of which is dependent upon the revenue recognition policy by contract 
for revenue recognized under the completed contract method  costs are deferred until the products are delivered  or upon completion of services or  where applicable  customer acceptance 
for revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method  costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation 
for revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract  costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  commencing on the date of revenue recognition 
at each balance sheet date  we review deferred costs to ensure they are ultimately recoverable 
any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
assessing the recoverability of deferred project costs is based on significant assumptions and estimates  including future revenue and cost of sales 
significant or sustained decreases in revenue or increases in cost of sales in future periods could result in additional impairments of deferred project costs 
we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of such impairments 
should the value of deferred project costs become impaired  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we make estimates of the uncollectible portion of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze the age of accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
similarly  we make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
significant judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates or actual future experience was different from the judgments and estimates 
estimating losses on excess office facilities 
we made significant estimates in determining the appropriate amount of accrued loss on excess office facilities 
if we made different estimates  our loss on excess office facilities could be significantly different from that recorded  which could have a material impact on our operating results 
valuation of equity method investments 
we use the equity method in circumstances where we have the ability to exert significant influence  but not control  over an investee or joint venture 
we initially record our investment based on a fair value analysis of the investment 
prior to  most of our equity method investments were purchased with cash which was determined to be fair value 
for the investment in rhapsody as of march   we used multiple valuation models that were based on assumptions of future results  including operating and cash flow projections  to calculate the fair value since we contributed both cash and non cash items in exchange for our interest 
these models were based upon estimates and assumptions relating to future revenue  cash flows  operating expenses  costs of capital and capital purchases 
these estimates and assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including  but not limited to  the cash flows of long term operating plans  market and interest rate risk  and risk commensurate discount rates and cost of capital 
we record our percentage interest in the investee or joint venture s income or loss under this method  which will increase or decrease the value of the investment 
we record investee losses up to the aggregate amount of the investment 
we evaluate impairment of an investment valued under the equity method only if events and circumstances warrant 
an impairment charge would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary 
in determining if a decline is other than temporary  we consider factors such as the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the investee or joint venture  the near term and longer term operating and financial prospects of the investee or joint venture and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery 
valuation of available for sale securities 
our investments in publicly traded companies are accounted for as available for sale and are carried at current market value 
we periodically evaluate whether any declines in fair value of our available for sale securities are other than temporary based on a review of qualitative and quantitative factors 
for investments with publicly quoted market prices  these factors include the time period and extent by which its accounting basis exceeds its quoted market price 
we consider additional factors to determine whether declines in fair value are other than temporary  such as the investee s financial condition  results of operations  and operating trends 
the evaluation also considers publicly available information regarding the investee companies 
valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  as well as amortizable intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
long lived assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
the impairment analysis of long lived assets is based upon estimates and assumptions relating to our future revenue  cash flows  operating expenses  costs of capital and capital purchases 
these estimates and assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including  but not limited to  the cash flows of our long term operating plans  market and interest rate risk  and risk commensurate discount rates and cost of capital 
significant or sustained declines in future revenue or cash flows  or adverse changes in our business climate  among other factors  and their resulting impact on the estimates and assumptions relating to the value of our long lived assets could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis in future interim periods which could result in a significant impairment 
while we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  due to their complexity and subjectivity  these estimates and assumptions could vary period to period 
valuation of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis  in our fourth quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill relates is less than the carrying value 
we consider a synthesis of the following important factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  
table of contents market and interest rate risk  changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for our business  and loss of key personnel 
in addition  we perform a reconciliation of our market capitalization plus a reasonable control premium to the aggregated implied fair value of all of our reporting units 
if we were to determine that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value  including goodwill  based upon the annual test or the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
judgment is required in determining our reporting units and assessing fair value of the reporting units 
the impairment analysis of goodwill is based upon estimates and assumptions relating to our future revenue  cash flows  operating expenses  costs of capital and capital purchases 
these estimates and assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including  but not limited to  the cash flows of our long term operating plans  market and interest rate risk  and risk commensurate discount rates and cost of capital 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model or other appropriate valuation models and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
the valuation models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility in our common stock price and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation models change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from the amounts recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
accounting for gains on sale of subsidiary stock 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment to arb no 
sfas which was primarily codified into fasb asc consolidation asc 
current guidance requires the difference between the carrying amount of the parent s investment in a subsidiary and the underlying net book value of the subsidiary after the issuance of stock by the subsidiary to be recorded as equity transactions 
we elected to recognize any such gain in our consolidated statement of operations prior to january  as was allowable under generally accepted accounting principles in place at that time if certain recognition criteria were met 
due to the completion of the restructuring of rhapsody on march   which resulted in our holding approximately of the outstanding shares of capital stock of rhapsody  this accounting policy will no longer apply with respect to our investment as we no longer consolidate rhapsody and no longer report a noncontrolling interest 

table of contents accounting for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine current provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
each reporting period we must periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations and comprehensive income 
factors we consider in making such an assessment include  but are not limited to  past performance and our expectation of future taxable income  macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our investments and other assets 
historically  we have not provided for us deferred income taxes or withholding taxes on certain foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings 
these earnings had been intended to be permanently reinvested in operations outside of the us as a result of the decision to pay the special cash dividend and to effect the reverse stock split in august  we repatriated some of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings in the fourth quarter of this repatriation was a one time change in our assertion on foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings  as we otherwise intend to reinvest future earnings outside of the us indefinitely 
as of december   approximately million of the million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
the company has reviewed each of its foreign subsidiaries and as of december  has repatriated approximately million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries 
the company believes repatriation of these earnings will result in additional taxes of approximately million and have provided for that amount in the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we currently have significant net operating losses and other tax attributes that will be used to offset the million of additional taxes  and as a result  the repatriation did not have a material impact on our tax expense for the year ended december   as we are utilizing net operating losses  which had a full valuation allowance 
as of december   we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  since such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us if these amounts were distributed to the us  in the form of dividends or otherwise  the company could be subject to additional us income taxes 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability or benefit on such earnings due to the timing of such future distributions  the availability of foreign tax credits  and the complexity of the computation if such earnings were not deemed to be permanently reinvested 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital  and long term investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for us income and foreign withholding taxes  net of foreign tax credits  may be necessary 
recently issued accounting standards with the exception of those discussed below  there have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the year ended december   as compared to the recent accounting pronouncements described in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   that are of significance  or potential significance to us 
in september  the fasb ratified accounting standards update asu asu previously emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
asu supersedes eitf and addresses criteria for separating the consideration in multiple element arrangements 
asu requires companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or other third party evidence of the selling price 
in september  the fasb ratified asu asu previously eitf no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
asu modifies the scope of software revenue recognition to exclude a non software components of tangible products and b software components of tangible products that are sold  licensed  or leased with tangible products when the software components and non software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality 

table of contents the company elected to adopt asu and asu at the beginning of the first quarter of on a prospective basis 
the company did not have a significant change in units of accounting  allocation methodology  or timing of revenue recognition 
as a result  the adoption of these accounting standards did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
asu will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of asu to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
all statements that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk from changes in market interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity investments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of high quality debt securities as specified in our investment policy 
investments in both fixed and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
additionally  a declining rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate  generating less interest income 
see note cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash equivalents and investments for additional information 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may be adversely impacted due to changes in interest rates 
in addition  we may incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our short term investments until maturity  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 
there have been no material changes in our investment methodology regarding our cash equivalents and short term investments during the year ended december  based on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash equivalents at december   a hypothetical increase decrease in interest rates would not increase decrease our annual interest income or cash flows by more than a nominal amount 
investment risk 
as of december   we had investments in voting capital stock of both publicly traded and privately held technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
our investments in publicly traded companies are accounted for as available for sale  carried at current market value and are classified as long term as they are strategic in nature 
we periodically evaluate whether any declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary based on a review of qualitative and quantitative factors 
for investments with publicly quoted market prices  these factors include the time period and extent by which its accounting basis exceeds its quoted market price 
we consider additional factors to determine whether declines in fair value are other than temporary  such as the investee s financial condition  results of operations  and operating trends 
the evaluation also considers publicly available information regarding the investee companies 
for investments in private companies with no quoted market price  we consider similar qualitative and quantitative factors as well as the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee 
based upon an evaluation of the facts and circumstances during the years ended december   we determined that no additional other than temporary decline in fair value had occurred and therefore no impairment charges were recorded in foreign currency risk 
we conduct business internationally in several currencies 
as such  we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arise in part from translation of the financial results of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation  the remeasurement of non functional currency assets  liabilities and intercompany balances into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  and non us dollar denominated sales to foreign customers 
a portion of these risks is managed through the use of financial derivatives  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
generally  our practice is to manage foreign currency risk for the majority of material short term intercompany balances through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
these contracts require us to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the contract s inception 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the short term intercompany balances  these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from certain changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not designate our foreign exchange forward contracts related to short term intercompany accounts as hedges and  accordingly  we adjust these instruments to fair value through results of operations 
however  we may periodically hedge a portion of our foreign exchange exposures associated with material firmly committed transactions  long term investments  highly predictable anticipated exposures and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
some of our unhedged exposures are reconciled through our statement of operations on a mark to market basis each quarter  so to the extent we continue to experience adverse economic conditions  we may record losses related to such unhedged exposures in future periods that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our foreign currency risk management program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
we have cash balances denominated in foreign currencies which are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
the majority of our foreign currency denominated cash is held in korean won and euros 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the korean won and euro relative to the us dollar at december  would not result in more than a nominal amount of unrealized gain or loss 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material for the years ended december    and
