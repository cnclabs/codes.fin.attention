ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as ball corporation  ball  the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis 
overview business overview ball corporation is one of the world s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage  food  personal care and household products industries 
our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in facilities around the world 
we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 
we sell our packaging products mainly to large  multinational beverage  food  personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long term customer relationships 
this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts 
while we have a diversified customer base  we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america  europe  the prc  brazil and argentina  as do our equity joint ventures in the us and vietnam 
the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 
industry trends and corporate strategy in the rigid packaging industry  sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs  increasing prices  developing new products  expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions 
over the past few years  we have closed a number of packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand 
we have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our global operations 
to better realign capacity  in we closed our torrance  california  us  facility  relocated one of the lines to our whitby  ontario  canada  facility  relocated one line from lublin  poland  to our belgrade  serbia  facility  reduced capacity in our columbus  ohio  us  metal beverage facility and redeployed surplus equipment to other global locations 
as part of our drive for vision  we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer 
we have been placing additional emphasis on technology and innovation throughout our businesses during and will continue to do so in and beyond 
these innovations include new shapes  sizes  opening features and other functional benefits  as well as increasing the use of recycled content and lightweighting of our packages 
this ongoing packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage  food  personal care and household products customers 
our sustainability vision encompasses balancing economic  environmental and social impacts in our decision making and activities 
successfully executing this vision will create long term  shared value for our stakeholders  and ball is committed to practicing sustainability as a way of doing business

the north american metal beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature and industry volumes for certain types of containers have declined over the past several years 
as a result  we have reduced our excess capacity in certain north american metal beverage facilities for those containers 
the metal beverage container industries in other parts of the world are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term 
we have been able to capitalize on this growth by adding a facility  as well as additional capacity  in our latapack ball  consolidated brazilian joint venture and by increasing capacity in some of our european metal beverage container manufacturing facilities by speeding up 
table of contents certain lines and by expansion 
in  we expanded our lightweight alumi tek bottle production to our golden  colorado  facility  and we commenced specialty can production in our fort worth  texas  us  facility 
we also announced that latapack ball would construct a new metal beverage container manufacturing facility in alagoinhas  bahia  which is in northeast brazil  one of the fastest growing regions of the country 
the new facility will begin production in early the output from the first line has been contracted for sale under a long term agreement 
additionally  in march we entered into a joint venture agreement with thai beverage can limited to construct a beverage container manufacturing facility in vietnam that will begin production in the first quarter of we have also made recent strategic acquisitions 
in october  we acquired our partners interests in qmcp and recorded a gain of million related to our previously held interest in the joint venture 
additionally  we are constructing a new expanded beverage container facility for qmcp that will begin production in the first quarter of in july  we entered the aluminum slug market by acquiring the leading north american manufacturer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol containers  beverage bottles  collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions 
to further expand this new product line and broaden our market development efforts into a new customer base  in january  we acquired a leading european supplier of aluminum aerosol containers and bottles and the slugs used to make them 
further details of recent acquisitions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
we recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using percentage of completion under the cost to cost method of accounting 
the contract mix consisted of approximately percent cost type contracts  which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and or earned profit component  and percent fixed price contracts 
the remainder represents time and material contracts  which typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates 
the contracted backlog at december   of approximately million consisted of approximately percent fixed price contracts indicating a continuing trend towards more fixed price business 
throughout the period of contract performance  we regularly reevaluate and  if necessary  revise our estimates of aerospace and technologies total contract revenue  total contract cost and progress toward completion 
because of contract payment schedules  limitations on funding and other contract terms  our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 
management performance measures management uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period  economic value added net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed  earnings before interest and taxes ebit  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  diluted earnings per share  cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment 
these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions 
nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates  quality control figures  environmental  health and safety statistics  production and sales volumes  asset utilization rates  and measures of sustainability 
additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization  award and incentive fees realized  proposal win rates and backlog including awarded  contracted and funded backlog

however  upon the adoption of prospective accounting guidance effective january   the amount of accounts receivable sold is not reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable  which resulted in a million working capital outflow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows

free cash flow management internally uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company s operating results  to plan stock buyback levels and to evaluate the company s ability to incur and service debt 
free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap  and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures 
the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment capital spending 
free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company s cash flow statements  however  it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 

table of contents based on the above definition  our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows in millions cash flows from operating activities  including discontinued operations adjust for increase in accounts receivable due to change in accounting for securitization program capital spending  including discontinued operations free cash flow based on information currently available  we estimate cash flows from operating activities for to be in excess of million  capital spending to be approximately million and free cash flow to be in the range of million 
in  we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to continue to fund our stock repurchases  dividend payments  growth capital projects and  to the extent available  acquisitions that meet our various criteria 
comparable ebit  comparable net earnings  comparable ebitda and ratios management internally uses comparable earnings before interest and taxes comparable ebit  comparable earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization comparable ebitda and comparable earnings to evaluate the company s operating performance 
we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions 
ebit  ebitda and net earnings are typically derived directly from the company s statements of earnings  however  they may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 
based on the above definitions  our calculation of comparable ebit is summarized below in millions earnings before taxes  as reported interest expense earnings before interest and taxes ebit business consolidation activities gain on disposition comparable ebit our calculations of comparable ebitda  the comparable ebit to interest ratio and the net debt to comparable ebitda ratio are summarized below in millions  except ratios comparable ebit as calculated above add depreciation and amortization comparable ebitda interest expense excluding debt refinancing cost total debt at december a less cash net debt comparable ebit interest x x x net debt comparable ebitda x x x a debt amounts at december   do not include amounts borrowed under the company s off balance sheet accounts receivable securitization program of million 

table of contents our calculation of comparable net earnings is summarized below in millions  except per share amounts net earnings attributable to ball corporation  as reported discontinued operations  net of tax business consolidation and other activities  net of tax equity earnings and gains related to acquisitions  net of tax debt refinancing costs  net of tax gain on disposition  net of tax net earnings attributable to ball corporation before above transactions comparable earnings per diluted share from continuing operations  as reported per diluted share  as adjusted commitments cash payments required for long term debt maturities  rental payments under noncancellable operating leases  purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december   are summarized in the following table payments due by period a in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including capital leases interest payments on long term debt b operating leases purchase obligations c total payments on contractual obligations a amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at year end exchange rates 
b for variable rate facilities  amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company 
c the company s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum  steel and other direct materials 
also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity  expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items 
in cases where variable prices and or usage are involved  management s best estimates have been used 
depending on the circumstances  early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and  therefore  actual payments could vary significantly 
the table above does not include million of uncertain tax positions  the timing of which is unknown at this time 
contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans  not including the unfunded german plans  are expected to be in the range of million in this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance  among other factors 
benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be million  million  million  million and million for the years ending december  through  respectively  and a total of million for the years through payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be between million million and million million in each of the years through and a total of million million for the years through for the us pension plans in  we revised our return on asset assumption to percent from percent in and our discount rate assumption to an average of percent from percent in 
based on these changes in assumptions and revisions based on plan experience studies  us pension expense in is anticipated to be approximately million higher than in taking into consideration higher pension funding in  a further reduction of the expected return on us pension assets assumption by a quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated million increase in the global pension expense  while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated million of additional pension expense in additional information regarding the company s pension plans is provided in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this annual report 

table of contents due to the us tax status of certain of ball s subsidiaries in canada and the prc  the company annually provides us taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries  net of any estimated foreign tax credits 
in  ball increased its economic interest in its brazilian joint venture  and due to the nature of the investment  ball provides deferred taxes on the portion of undistributed earnings of the brazil investment related to this incremental investment 
net us taxes provided for brazil  canada and prc earnings in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
for the foreseeable future  anticipated cash flow from the us operations should be sufficient to meet the domestic operational needs  including capital expenditures  dividends  share repurchases and debt service  including minimal near term debt maturities over the next few years 
should domestic cash flow gaps arise due to unforeseen events  ball can access funds in the us to bridge those gaps from its committed revolving credit facility  from public bond markets  from cash deposits in the prc on earnings for which us taxes have been provided and from repayment of outstanding us loans to foreign subsidiaries 
consequently  management s intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of ball s remaining foreign investments and  as a result  no us income or federal withholding tax provision has been made 
it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings  however  repatriation of these earnings would result in a relatively high incremental tax rate 
contingencies the company is subject to routine litigation incident to operating its businesses  and has been designated by various federal and state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party  along with numerous other companies  for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites

you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our k  q and k reports to the sec 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and risk management in the ordinary course of business  we employ established risk management policies and procedures  which seek to reduce ball s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates  foreign currencies and prices of the company s common stock and the company s deferred compensation stock plan 
however  there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful 
although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit  market and interest risk  the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements 
we monitor counterparty credit risk  including lenders  on a regular basis  but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective 
further details are available in note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this annual report 
we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis 
market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments  financial instruments and commodity positions 
to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure  we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices or rates 
the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 
commodity price risk aluminum we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods 
first  we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot based pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial supply contracts for the purchase of aluminum products 
the terms include fixed  floating or pass through aluminum ingot component pricing 
second  we generally use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not an arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing 
steel most sales contracts involving our steel products either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes incurred  or they incorporate annually negotiated steel prices 
we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price changes that may occur in considering the effects of derivative instruments  the company s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions  the market s ability to accept price increases and the company s commodity price exposures under its contract terms  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the company s steel and aluminum prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
additionally  the company has currency exposures on raw materials  and the effect of a percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity  as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost 
a hypothetical percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period 
a hypothetical percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
interest rate risk our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we may use a variety of interest rate swaps  collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
interest rate instruments held by the company at december   included pay fixed interest rate swaps 
pay fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments 

table of contents based on our interest rate exposure at december   assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next months and the effects of derivative instruments  a basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 
currency exchange rate risk our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts 
in addition  at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies  and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company s net earnings 
our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business 
we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and  to a lesser extent  in other currencies 
sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and  where there is not an exchange pass through arrangement  the company uses forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures 
considering the company s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december   and the currency exposures  a hypothetical percent reduction us dollar strengthening in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
this hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by million 
actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 
common stock price risk the company s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and  accordingly  is marked to fair value using the company s closing stock price at the end of a reporting period 
based on current share levels in the program  each change in the company s stock price has an impact of million on pretax earnings 
during march and september  the company entered into total return swaps to mitigate the company s exposure to these fair value fluctuations
