see use of non gaap measures for measuring annual results for a definition and reconciliation of adjusted earnings per diluted common share to earnings per diluted common share and for reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda and margin 
as adjusted  see note acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements 
table of contents use of non gaap measures for measuring annual results the corporation calculates adjusted ebitda as provided in the reconciliation below and calculates adjusted ebitda margin by taking adjusted ebitda and dividing it by revenues 
the corporation calculates and uses adjusted ebitda as an indicator of its ability to generate cash from reported operating results 
the measurement is used in concert with net income and cash flows from operating activities  which measure actual cash generated in the period 
in addition  the corporation believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are supplemental measurement tools used by analysts and investors to help evaluate overall operating performance and the ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
in addition  adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is used in conjunction with the corporation s debt leverage ratio and this calculation sets the applicable margin for the quarterly interest charge 
adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is not the same calculation as this adjusted ebitda table 
adjusted ebitda does not represent funds available for the corporation s discretionary use and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operating activities data as measured under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the items excluded from adjusted ebitda but included in the calculation of the corporation s reported net income and cash flows from operating activities are significant components of the accompanying consolidated income statements and cash flows  and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance 
the corporation s calculation of adjusted ebitda may not be consistent with calculations of ebitda used by other companies 
the following is a reconciliation of the corporation s net income  net operating cash flows and earnings per diluted share for the periods presented 
the corporation calculates and uses adjusted earnings per diluted common share  which is exclusive of the impact of impairment of intangible assets  integration  merger and acquisition related costs and other charges  change in estimate on cost of goods sold  change in estimate on allowance for doubtful accounts and tax accounting matters as an indicator of its core operating results 
the measurement is used in concert with net income and earnings per diluted share  which measure actual earnings per share generated in the period 
the corporation believes the exclusion of these charges in expressing earnings per share provides management with a useful measure to assess period to period comparability and is useful to investors in evaluating the corporation s operating results from period to period 
adjusted earnings per diluted common share  which is exclusive of the impact of impairment of intangible assets  integration  merger and acquisition related costs and other charges  change in estimate on cost of goods sold  change in estimate on allowance for doubtful accounts and tax accounting matters does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders ie  such costs are a reduction in earnings and stockholders equity and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for earnings per diluted share as measured under gaap 
the integration  merger and acquisition related costs and other charges  impairment on intangible assets  change in estimate on cost of goods sold  change in estimate on allowance for doubtful accounts and tax accounting matters excluded from the earnings per diluted share are significant components of the accompanying consolidated income statements  and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance

the corporation s business and industry trends the corporation is an institutional pharmacy services company  which services healthcare facilities and provides management pharmacy services to hospitals 
the corporation is the second largest institutional pharmacy services company in the united states 
the corporation operates institutional pharmacies in states 
the corporation s customers are typically institutional healthcare providers  such as nursing centers  assisted living facilities  hospitals and other long term alternative care settings 
the corporation is generally the primary source of supply of pharmaceuticals to its customers 
the corporation also provides pharmacy management services to hospitals in the united states 
the institutional pharmacy services business is highly competitive 
competition is a significant factor that can impact the corporation s overall financial results  pricing to customers  and bed retention 
in each geographic market  there are national  regional and local institutional pharmacies that provide services comparable to those offered by the corporation s pharmacies 
these pharmacies may have greater financial and other resources than we do and may be more established in the markets they serve than we are 
the corporation also competes against regional and local pharmacies that specialize in the highly fragmented long term care markets 
in the future some of the corporation s customers may seek to in source the provision of pharmaceuticals to patients in their facilities by establishing an internal pharmacy 
a variety of factors are affecting the institutional pharmacy industry 
with an aging population and the extension of drug coverage to a greater number of individuals through medicare part d  the consumption of pharmaceuticals by residents of long term care facilities is likely to increase in the future 
in addition  individuals are expected to enter assisted living facilities  independent living facilities and continuing care retirement communities at increasing rates 
under medicare part d  eligible individuals may choose to enroll in various medicare part d plans to receive prescription drug coverage 
each medicare part d plan determines a distinct formulary for the long term care residents enrolled in its plan 
accordingly  institutional pharmacies have incurred increased administrative costs to manage each part d plan s formulary  reimbursement and administrative processes for their long term care enrollees 
institutional pharmacies may continue to experience increased administrative burdens and costs due to the greater complexity of the requirements for drug reimbursement  including costs associated with the short cycle dispensing requirements which take effect january  medicare part d also requires increased choices for patients with respect to complex drug categories and therapeutic interchange opportunities 
institutional pharmacies may realize increased revenue by providing long term care residents with specialized services in these areas 
continued industry consolidation may also impact the dynamics of the institutional pharmacy market 

table of contents in addition  our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals 
competition for qualified pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals is strong 
the loss of pharmacy personnel or the inability to attract  retain or motivate sufficient numbers of qualified pharmacy professionals could adversely affect our business 
although we generally have been able to meet our staffing requirements for pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals in the past  our inability to do so in the future could have a material adverse impact on us 
unsolicited tender offer by omnicare on august   omnicare  inc omnicare made public an unsolicited proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the corporation s common stock for per share in cash 
after careful consideration with our financial and legal advisors  our board of directors determined unanimously that omnicare s proposal undervalues the corporation and was not in the best interests of our stockholders 
on september   omnicare  through its wholly owned subsidiary  philadelphia acquisition sub  inc  commenced an unsolicited tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of our common stock at per share 
on september   the board again met with its financial and legal advisors  and after careful consideration our board of directors again unanimously recommended that our stockholders reject the offer and not tender their shares of our common stock because it believes that omnicare s tender offer i undervalues the corporation and its prospects  ii is illusory because it is subject to significant regulatory and other uncertainty  and iii is opportunistic based on the corporation s then traded market value 
on september   we filed with the securities and exchange commission sec a recommendation solicitation statement on schedule d detailing the recommendation of our board of directors in response to omnicare s tender offer and the reasons it rejected the offer 
see note commitments and contingencies for a discussion of certain litigation commenced in respect of omnicare s tender offer and related actions 
on october   omnicare extended the expiration date of its tender offer until pm  new york city time  on friday  december   unless further extended

on january   omnicare extended the expiration of its tender offer until pm  new york city time  on friday  february   unless further extended 
on august   after careful consideration and consultation with our financial and legal advisors  our board of directors adopted a rights plan and authorized the execution of the rights agreement  dated august  the rights agreement  between the corporation and mellon investor services llc  as rights agent 
on august   the board of directors of the corporation declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right a right for each outstanding share of common stock  par value per share 
the dividend was payable on september  to the stockholders of record on september  the rights will expire on the earlier of august   or redemption by the corporation 
however  the rights will expire immediately at the final adjournment of the corporation s annual meeting of stockholders if stockholder approval of the rights agreement has not been received prior to that time 
the rights agreement is designed to prevent third parties from opportunistically acquiring the corporation in a transaction that the corporation s board of directors believes is not in the best interests of the corporation s stockholders 
in general terms  it works by imposing a significant penalty upon any person or group that acquires beneficial ownership of percent or more of our outstanding common stock without the prior approval of our board of directors 
the corporation s board of directors believes the rights agreement has helped the corporation s stockholders at this time by effectively preventing omnicare from opportunistically acquiring the corporation at a price that the corporation s board of directors believes is inadequate for the reasons discussed above 
the rights agreement has been narrowly tailored in a manner that our board of directors believes appropriately balances the interests of our stockholders in connection with what our board of directors considers an opportunistic  illusory and disadvantageous proposal  against the need to avoid excessive anti takeover protections that ultimately may adversely impact stockholder value 
the rights agreement should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the board of directors

the complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition would be illegal and in violation of section of the ftc act and section of the clayton act because it would harm competition and enable omnicare to raise the price of drugs for medicare part d consumers and others 
the case is scheduled to be heard before an administrative law judge at the ftc in june the financial and outside legal advisors to the corporation and omnicare have continued to meet from time to time in an effort to agree upon an acceptable information sharing process relating to antitrust issues 
on october   the corporation and omnicare and their respective outside legal advisors entered into a confidentiality and joint defense agreement the confidentiality and joint defense agreement  which provides  among other things  for the parties to exchange on a confidential and privileged basis information in order to facilitate their respective assessment of the antitrust risk associated with a potential combination of the two companies 
although the corporation s board of directors continues to believe that omnicare s per share offer undervalues the corporation  the corporation is engaging in this analytical process in order to further its understanding of omnicare s assessment of the antitrust risk related to a business combination 
the confidentiality and joint defense agreement does not obligate the corporation to enter a transaction with omnicare and there can be no assurance that this review will lead to a definitive merger agreement or any transaction between the two companies 
in connection with these matters  for the year ended december   we expensed million of legal and advisory fees  which are included in integration  merger and acquisition related costs and other charges in the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to incur significant additional costs in the future in connection with omnicare s unsolicited tender offer

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
the corporation s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and with the corporation s independent registered public accounting firm  and they both have reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to critical accounting estimates 
the table of critical accounting estimates is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the corporation s accounting policies that require estimates 
management believes that of the significant accounting policies  as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the corporation 
the table that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate 
our sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the assumptions listed  based upon the actual results of the corporation for the year ended december   and the actual diluted shares 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from prescription drug plans pdp s under medicaid part d  long term care institutions  the respective state medicaid programs  private payers and third party insurance companies 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flows 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of our receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
in addition  certain drugs dispensed are subject to being returned and the responsible paying party is due a credit for such returns 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  included in our balance sheets at december  and  were million and million  respectively 
our quarterly provision for doubtful accounts included in our income statements was as follows dollars in millions amount of revenues march june september december march june september december march june september december assumptions approach used the largest components of bad debts in our accounts receivable relate to the accounts for which private payers are responsible which we refer to as private and other  accounts for which our customers from long term care institutions are responsible for under medicare part a and owe us for the drug component of their patients stay at their respective institution and third party  medicare part d  and medicaid accounts that have been denied 
we attempt to collect the private and other accounts through various efforts for which the patient is the responsible party 
we attempt to collect payments due from long term care institutions through billing and collecting in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
we attempt to collect from third party  medicare part d and medicaid accounts by obtaining the appropriate documentation and direct discussions with the payors 
in all cases  the drugs have been dispensed 
in general  we perform the following steps in collecting accounts receivable if possible  perform up front adjudication prior to dispensing the product  billing and follow up with third party payers  billing and follow up with long term care institutions  utilization of collection agencies  and other legal processes 
the corporation has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  which relies on analytical tools  specific identification  and benchmarks to arrive at a reasonable allowance 
no single statistic or measurement alone determines the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we monitor and review trends by payer classification along with the composition of our aging accounts receivable 
this review is focused primarily on trends in private and other payer  pdp s  dual eligible co payments  historic payment patterns of long term care institutions  and monitoring respective credit risks 
in addition  we analyze other factors such as revenue days in accounts receivables  denial trends by payer types  payment patterns by payer types  subsequent cash collections  and current events that may impact payment patterns of our long term care institution customers 
the following table shows our institutional pharmacy revenue days outstanding reflected in our institutional pharmacy net accounts receivable as of the dates indicated march june september december in the first quarter of  the corporation benefited from improved collections from the part d payors due to the requirements of the mippa 
mippa required part d payors to pay claims within days  or within days if submitted electronically  beginning with the plan years 
as a result of the mippa requirements  the corporation collected a larger amount of receivables in the first quarter of than normal 
sensitivity analysis if our provision as a percent of institutional revenue increases  our after tax income would decrease by approximately million or per diluted share 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate uncollectible accounts that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
our estimates may be impacted by economic conditions  success in collections  payer mix and trends in federal and state regulations

assumptions approach used we recognize revenues at the time services are provided or products are delivered 
a significant portion of our revenues are billed to pdps under medicare part d  the state medicaid programs  long term care institutions  third party insurance companies  and private payers 
some claims are electronically adjudicated through online processing at the point the prescription is dispensed such that our operating system is automatically updated with the actual amount to be reimbursed 
as a result  our revenues and the associated receivables are based upon the actual reimbursement to be received 
for claims that are adjudicated on line and are rejected or otherwise denied upon submission  the corporation provides contractual allowances based upon historical trends  contractual reimbursement terms and other factors which may impact ultimate reimbursement 
amounts are adjusted to actual reimbursed amounts based upon cash receipts 
co payments for our services can be applicable under medicare part d  the state medicaid programs  and certain third party payers and are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are provided 
co payments under the medicaid programs and third party plans are generally billed to the responsible party as part of our normal billing procedures which are subject to normal collection procedures 
under medicare part d  institutional residents who are dual eligible have co payments due from the responsible party for up to the first thirty days of a beneficiary s stay in a skilled nursing facility subsequent to which the pdp s are responsible for reimbursement 
under certain circumstances  including state mandated return policies under various medicaid programs  we accept returns of medications and issue credit memorandums to the applicable payer 
product returns are processed in the period returned 
we estimate an amount for expected returns based on historical trends 
our hospital pharmacy management revenues represent contractually defined management fees and the reimbursement of costs associated with the direct operations of hospital pharmacies  and are primarily comprised of personnel costs 
sensitivity analysis if our reimbursement declined or was negatively impacted of revenues  the negative impact on net income would be million or per diluted common share 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item inventory and cost of drugs dispensed we have inventory located at each of our institutional pharmacy locations 
our inventory is maintained on a first in  first out lower of cost or market basis 
the inventory consists of prescription drugs  over the counter products and intravenous solutions 
our inventory relating to controlled substances is maintained on a manually prepared perpetual system to the extent required by the drug enforcement agency 
all other inventory is maintained on a periodic system  through the performance of quarterly physical inventories at the end of each quarter 
all inventory counts are reconciled to the balance sheet account and differences are adjusted through cost of goods sold 
in addition  we record an amount of potential returns of prescription drugs based on historical rates of returns 
at december  and  our inventory on our consolidated balance sheets was as follows dollars in millions our annualized inventory turns were as follows march june september december we receive rebates on purchases from various vendors and suppliers 
rebates included in our income statements were as follows dollars in millions march june september december please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed discussion of our inventory 
assumptions approach used our inventory is maintained on a first in  first out lower of cost or market basis 
our controlled prescription drugs are maintained on a perpetual inventory basis to the extent required by the drug enforcement agency 
all other inventory is maintained on a periodic basis 
we perform quarterly inventory counts at all locations with the use of our personnel and the use of third party inventory count teams under our supervision 
we perform quarterly inventory counts in the third month of each quarter 
all inventory counts are reconciled to the balance sheet account and differences are adjusted through cost of goods sold 
in addition  we record an amount of potential returns of prescription drugs based on historical rates of returns 
we account for rebates and other incentives received from vendors and suppliers  relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory  as a reduction to cost of goods sold and inventory 
we consider these rebates to represent product discounts  and as a result  the rebates are allocated as a reduction of product cost and relieved through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory 
sensitivity analysis actual inventory counts may include estimates based on amounts that may be dispensed from an open container 
in addition  items are reviewed for potential obsolescence 
a error rate in the count of prescription drugs in inventory would negatively impact net income million  or per diluted common share 
if our rebates received were to be reduced by  the effect on net income for the year ended december  would have been a decrease of million  or per diluted common share 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item goodwill  other intangible assets and accounting for business combinations goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of trade names  customer relationship assets  and non compete agreements 
our goodwill included in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and was as follows dollars in millions our net intangible assets  included in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were as follows dollars in millions customer relationships tradenames non competition agreements accumulated amortization please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed roll forward of our goodwill and intangible assets 
assumptions approach used in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not defined as having a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the amendments in this asu are effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the corporation adopted the guidance for the fiscal year ended december  the corporation performed a qualitative assessment of its reporting unit  and did not find it necessary to perform the first step of the two step impairment test based on that analysis 
the corporation performs an annual qualitative assessment of its goodwill reporting unit to determine if it is necessary to proceed to the first step of the two step impairment test 
the corporation is not required to do so unless  based on the qualitative assessment  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the corporation must continue to step one  then we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
the purchase price of acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
we engage independent third party resources to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance 
fair value estimates are determined by management based upon established market values of comparable assets  or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable 
the ultimate decision of allocations are that of management 
we assess for the potential impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets recorded on the corporation s balance sheet whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during the third quarter of  the corporation recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million related to finite lived customer relationships 
the impairment  which related to the institutional pharmacy segment  was incurred as the result of non renewal of certain customer contracts 
the impairment was related to intangible assets acquired in an acquisition during the year ended december  these asset groups were assessed for recoverability and management determined the finite lived customer relationship assets to be impaired 
no other assets within the asset groups were deemed impaired 
using a discounted cash flow analysis  the corporation determined that the pre tax impairment charge of million was required to write the carrying value down to fair value  resulting in a per diluted common share impact of 
the corporation recognized the impairment as a permanent write down of the cost basis and accumulated amortization of the affected assets 
sensitivity analysis we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of december    and and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
if actual future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future 
our estimate of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable based upon current facts and circumstances 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon the corporation s annual income or loss before income taxes for each respective accounting period 
the corporation recognizes an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that will result in a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
the corporation also recognizes as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our deferred tax asset balances in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were as follows dollars in millions  including the impact of valuation allowances our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were as follows dollars in millions significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions 
for an identified uncertain tax position to qualify for benefit recognition  the position must have at least a more likely than not chance of being sustained on its technical merits if challenged by relevant taxing authorities and taken by management to the court of last resort 
if an uncertain position does not meet this recognition threshold based on our analysis of applicable tax law  we establish a liability for the realized  but unrecognized tax benefit 
as of december   the corporation has no liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits for us federal and state tax jurisdictions 
the corporation records accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated income statements 
we recognize the benefit for an uncertain tax position we have taken upon any one of the following conditions the recognition threshold is met due to changes in facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date  the tax position is effectively settled through examination  negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed discussion of our accounting for income taxes 
assumptions approach used the first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance 
we then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 
the second step is to determine the amount of valuation allowance 
we will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities related to the jurisdiction identified in step one of the analysis 
in certain cases  we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities 
tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized in the corporation s financial statements if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether the position has met this recognition threshold  the corporation assumes that the appropriate taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the amount of benefit recognized in the corporation s financial statements for a tax position meeting the recognition threshold is determined by a measurement of the largest amount of benefit that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
subsequent recognition  derecognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions is based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
with respect to the net operating loss carryforwards  the corporation considers all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
this includes an analysis of the statutory carryforward available under law  anticipated future income or loss  as well as tax planning strategies 
if the cumulative weight of evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net operating losses will not be realized  a full or partial valuation allowance will be recognized based upon the qualitative and quantitative evidence examined 
sensitivity analysis our deferred tax assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities by million as of december   including the impact of valuation allowances 
historically  we have produced taxable income and we expect to generate taxable income in future years 
therefore  we believe that the likelihood of our not realizing the tax benefit of our deferred tax assets is remote 
while we have generated taxable income in recent years and expect to continue to do so in the future  we have tax loss carryovers in selected states that we expect to expire before we are able to fully use them to offset taxable income 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against these state losses 
if our conclusion about our ability to use these losses is incorrect  then our deferred tax assets would be understated or overstated at december  the irs may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies 
if the irs were to propose and sustain assessments we would incur additional tax payments for and plus the applicable penalties and interest 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item accounting for stock based compensation the corporation has reserved  shares of its common stock for awards to be granted under the omnibus plan plus  shares issued for substitute equity awards for employees of kps and pharmerica ltc whose awards were cancelled or forfeited upon the consummation of the pharmacy transaction 
the corporation has adopted the amended and restated pharmerica corporation omnibus incentive plan as amended and restated  omnibus plan under which the corporation is authorized to grant equity based and other awards to its employees  officers  directors and consultants 
in connection with the corporation s annual meeting of stockholders  the stockholders of the corporation approved and adopted the amended and restated omnibus plan to  among other things  implement a fungible share pool effective as of january   and preserve preferential tax treatment as qualified performance based compensation under section m of the internal revenue code 
under the fungible share pool  one share of stock will be subtracted from the share limit for each share of stock covered by a stock option or stock appreciation right award and shares of stock will be subtracted from the share limit for each share of stock covered by any full value award  including restricted stock awards  restricted stock units and performance share awards at target 
the following shares are not available for re grant under the omnibus plan i shares tendered by a participant or withheld by the corporation to pay the purchase price of a stock option award or to satisfy taxes owed with respect to an award  ii shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with such award s settlement upon the exercise thereof  and iii shares reacquired by the corporation using cash proceeds received by the corporation from the exercise of stock options 
effective january   shares subject to an award that is forfeited  expired or settled for cash  are available for re grant under the omnibus plan as one share of stock for each share of stock covered by a stock option or appreciation right and shares of stock for each share of stock covered by any other type of award 
the compensation committee has granted stock based compensation awards with respect to  common shares under the omnibus plan 
after consideration of forfeitures   shares remain available for grant at december  the  shares does not take into consideration the dilution of shares of stock for any full value award  including restructured stock awards  restricted stock units  and performance awards at target 
the number of shares remaining available for future issuance calculated under the fungible share would be  on january   a long term incentive award was granted which was comprised of  restricted stock units and  performance share units 
the award reduced the amount of shares available for future issuance calculated under the fungible share pool to  assumptions approach used stock options granted under the omnibus plan generally vest in three to four equal annual installments and have a term of seven years 
the restricted stock granted to officers and employees generally vests in full upon the three year anniversary of the date of grant 
the restricted stock units granted to officers generally vest in three equal annual installments 
the restricted stock grant to members of the board of directors vests in three equal annual installments 
the restricted stock units granted to members of the board of directors vest in one annual installment 
the performance share units granted under the omnibus plan vest based upon the achievement of a target amount of the corporation s earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  integration  merger and acquisition related costs and other charges  impairment of intangible assets  and any changes in accounting principles  which reinforces the importance of achieving the corporation s profitability objectives 
the performance is generally measured over a three year period 
we estimated the fair value of stock options granted during   and using the black scholes merton option valuation model bsm 
we are amortizing the fair value on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are the vesting periods of three to four years 
the weighted average fair value per share of stock options granted by us during   and were   and  respectively 
the following table shows the weighted average assumptions we used to develop the fair value estimates under our stock options valuation model for   and and the paragraphs below this table summarizes each assumption expected volatility range risk free interest rate range expected dividends average expected term years average fair value per share of stock options granted based on the black scholes merton model dollars weighted average fair value of options granted during the year in millions the corporation aggregates individual awards into relatively homogeneous groups with respect to exercise and post vesting employment behaviors for the purpose of refining the expected term assumption  regardless of the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value 
we have stratified our employee population into two groups i insiders  who are the section filers under sec rules  and ii non insiders  who are the rest of the employee population 
sensitivity analysis the fair value calculations of our stock option grants are affected by assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based upon the facts and circumstances at the time of grant 
changes in our volatility estimates can materially affect the fair values of our stock option grants 
if our stock based compensation expense during was higher  our after tax income would decrease by approximately million  or per diluted common share 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item accounting for stock based compensation continued our stock based compensation for the years ended december    and included in our results of operations was as follows dollars in millions please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed discussion of our accounting for stock based compensation 
assumptions approach used volatility is a measure of the tendency of investment returns to vary around a long term average rate 
historical volatility is an appropriate starting point for setting this assumption 
the corporation also considers how future experience may differ from the past 
this may require using other factors to adjust historical volatility  such as implied volatility  peer group volatility and the range and mean reversion of volatility estimates over various historical periods 
the peer group utilized consisted of fourteen companies in and and twelve companies in  in the same or similar industries as the corporation 
in addition  if a best estimate cannot be made  management uses the mid point in the range of reasonable estimates for volatility 
the corporation estimates the volatility of its common stock in conjunction with the corporation s annual grant and volatility is calculated utilizing the historical volatility of the corporation and its peer group 
to the extent material grants are made subsequent to the corporation s annual grant  the volatility calculation is updated through the most recent grant date of the awards 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero 
pre vesting forfeitures do not affect the fair value calculation  but they affect the expense calculation 
the corporation estimates pre vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we have estimated pre vesting option forfeitures and recorded share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
post vesting cancellations include vested options that are cancelled  exercised or expire unexercised 
the corporation calculated an expected term using management s estimate and expectation of option exercises 
the majority of the corporation s stock options are on a graded vesting schedule 
the corporation estimates the value of awards with graded vesting by treating each vesting tranche as a separate award 
management has determined to value each tranche of the awards separately utilizing a multiple fair value method

table of contents use of non gaap measures for measuring quarterly results the corporation calculates adjusted ebitda as provided in the reconciliation below and calculates adjusted ebitda margin by taking adjusted ebitda and dividing it by revenues 
the corporation calculates and uses adjusted ebitda as an indicator of its ability to generate cash from reported operating results 
the measurement is used in concert with net income and cash flows from operating activities  which measure actual cash generated in the period 
in addition  the corporation believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are supplemental measurement tools used by analysts and investors to help evaluate overall operating performance and the ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
in addition  adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is used in conjunction with the corporation s debt leverage ratio and this calculation sets the applicable margin for the quarterly interest charge 
adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is not the same calculation as this adjusted ebitda table 
adjusted ebitda does not represent funds available for the corporation s discretionary use and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operating activities data as measured under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap

the corporation believes the exclusion of these charges in expressing earnings per share provides management with a useful measure to assess period to period comparability and is useful to investors in evaluating the corporation s operating results from period to period 
adjusted earnings per diluted common share  which is exclusive of the impact of integration  merger and acquisition related costs and other charges  impairment of intangible assets  and tax accounting matters does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders ie  such costs are a reduction in earnings and stockholders equity and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for earnings per diluted common share as measured under gaap
