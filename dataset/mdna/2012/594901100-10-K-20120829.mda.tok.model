item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report for additional geographic data 
our international business and presence expose us to certain risks  such as currency  interest rate and political risks 
with respect to currency risk  we transact business in different currencies primarily through our foreign subsidiaries 
the fluctuation of currencies impacts sales and profitability 
frequently  sales and the costs associated with those sales are not denominated in the same currency 
we transacted business in  and currencies in fiscal years  and the relative currency mix over the past three fiscal years was as follows of reported revenues fiscal year ended june  exchange rates to us dollar as of june  revenues by currency united states dollar european euro british pound sterling australian dollar swiss franc canadian dollar mexican peso singapore dollar sweden krona japanese yen all other currencies total calculated using weighted average exchange rates for the fiscal year 
the of reported revenue for all other currencies is calculated based on the weighted average twelve month exchange rates for all other currencies 
the exchange rates to us dollar for all other currencies represents the weighted average june exchange rates for the currencies 
weighting is based on the twelve month fiscal year revenue for each country or region whose currency is included in the all other currencies category 
revenues from each currency included in all other currencies were less than of our total revenues for the period 
a increase or decrease in the value of both the euro and british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar in fiscal year would have affected total revenues by an aggregate of approximately million  or 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a weighted average change in the exchange rate during the year with all other variables being held constant 
this sensitivity analysis does not consider the effect of exchange rate changes on either cost of sales  operating expenses  or income taxes  and accordingly  is not an indicator of the effect of potential exchange rate changes on our net income attributable to micros systems  inc common shareholders 
we also are subject to interest rate fluctuations in foreign countries to the extent that we elect to borrow in the local foreign currency 
in the past  this has not been an issue of concern as we have the capacity to elect to borrow in other jurisdictions with more favorable interest rates 
we will continue to evaluate the need to invest in financial instruments designed to protect against interest rate fluctuations 
finally  we are subject to  among others  those environmental and geopolitical risks  and economic  pricing  financial  and other risks described in item a  risk factors 
patents and trademarks we hold six patents through our jtech subsidiary 
we also recently acquired an additional patents as part of our acquisition of torex 
in general  we believe that  historically  our competitive position has not been materially dependent upon patent protection 
the technology used in the design and manufacture of most of our hardware products is largely licensed or purchased from third parties 
with respect to our software products  we have historically relied on nondisclosure agreements and applicable us and foreign copyright and trademark laws for protection 
in the us and in most other countries  we believe that applicable law has provided and will continue to provide us with sufficient protection 
there are risks that third party entities  including competitors  could attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property 
given these potential risks  we have implemented procedures to monitor misappropriation of our intellectual property 
if a misappropriation is detected  we pursue appropriate legal action when we determine that such action is appropriate

we also own numerous other trademarks and servicemarks 
this annual report on form k also contains trademarks  trade names and servicemarks of other companies that are the property of their respective owners 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results  customers our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future depending upon various factors  including the timing of new product introductions  changes in our pricing and promotion policies and those of our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products and the capital expenditure budgets of our customers 
political uncertainty and international events that often are unpredictable  eg  terrorist attacks  natural disasters  and the volatile and unpredictable political climate in the middle east  are expected to continue to adversely impact travel and tourism and therefore our quarterly operating results 
in addition  over the last several fiscal years  world macroeconomic conditions and tightened credit markets have resulted in reduced demand from customers generally 
these conditions have made it harder for  and  in some cases  may have prevented  some customers from obtaining financing for intended purchases 
we believe that these economic conditions may have resulted in reduced demand for our products and services 
historically  our business has been affected by seasonal trends 
for example  the european summer holidays tend to lower our sales volume in the european countries during our first fiscal quarter  as compared to other quarters 
we also experience a stronger than average sales volume for the retail products and services in our second fiscal quarter due to the holiday season 
additionally  with the relative slowdown in corporate buying at the beginning of each calendar year  which is our third fiscal quarter  seasonal weakness for the third quarter ending march has been experienced 
therefore  we believe that sequential quarter to quarter historic comparisons of our results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
no single customer accounts for or more of our consolidated revenues 
during the fiscal years  and  we have been a party  directly and indirectly  to certain contracts with the us federal government  which contracts contained standard termination for convenience clauses 
our us government related revenue was less than for the fiscal year and approximately and of our total consolidated revenue for the fiscal years and  respectively 
we do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact if the us government elected to exercise its rights under a termination for convenience clause 
environmental matters we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and do not anticipate that environmental compliance will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations 
backlog we generally have an order backlog equal to approximately three months revenue  substantially all of which is cancelable at any time before shipment of hardware and software or rendering of services 
as of june   and  our backlog totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
historically  only an immaterial portion of the backlog existing as of the first day of the fiscal year does not result in recognizable revenue in that fiscal year

item a 
risk factors there are a number of risks to which we are subject 
these risks include the following environmental and geopolitical risks 
while we do not sell our products and services directly to consumers  changes in consumer habits in response to environmental or geopolitical risks affect demand for our products and services by the hospitality and tourism industries 
our business is very sensitive to the threat of terrorism and political uncertainty 
as the hospitality and tourism industries we serve are highly sensitive to consumer sentiments caused by world events  we are very vulnerable to downturns in customer buying habits associated with the threat of terrorist attacks and uncertain political climates  such as those existing in the middle east and parts of asia 
our business is very sensitive to environmental and health disasters 
actual or anticipated environmental disasters and epidemics  including for example  hurricanes  tsunamis  and disease  will deter and delay purchases of our products by customers  as concerns about potential or anticipated instances of environmental or health disasters tend to suppress travel and tourism 
environmental disasters also adversely affect our operations in the distressed areas 
higher oil and gas prices worldwide could have a material adverse impact on the travel and tourism industries  and indirectly  on our business 
material increases in oil and gas prices tend to reduce discretionary spending by consumers  such as on travel and dining  as well as on retail spending generally 
reductions in discretionary spending by consumers adversely affect our customers and  indirectly  our business 
moreover  increases in oil and gas prices also directly adversely affect our customer base in other ways 
for example  oil and gas price increases can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our restaurant customers 
we maintain offices and rely on distributors in parts of the world that are subject to economic instability  political unrest  and terrorism  such as the middle east and thailand 
the performance of our offices or distributors in these areas will be adversely affected if these regions become subject to economic declines  political strife or episodes of terrorism 
economic  pricing and financial risks 
we are subject to the variability of world economies 
since a majority of our business is conducted in foreign countries  a downturn in the economies of foreign countries would adversely affect our financial results 
while  under certain circumstances  reliance on foreign operations can have a moderating impact as one region s improving conditions may offset another region s declining conditions  our foreign businesses nonetheless add a degree of uncertainty to our planning and forecasting processes 
we are subject to the global economic crisis 
starting in the summer of  global economic conditions materially worsened 
while there has been some improvement subsequently  economic conditions continue to languish 
we believe these economic conditions resulted in reduced demand from customers and the inability of some customers to secure financing for intended purchases 
the current economic weakness may continue to result in the reduced demand for our products and services 
lack of worldwide economic growth has resulted in reduced consumer spending  which has adversely impacted our customers 
these economic conditions may also increase our bad debts 
our quarterly financial results are dependent upon the timing and size of customer orders and the shipment of products for large orders 
large software orders from customers may account for a meaningful portion of earnings in any quarter 
we expect the customers with whom we do the largest amount of business to vary from year to year as a result of the timing of the rollout of each customer s system 
further  if a customer delays or accelerates its delivery requirements  or if a product s completion is delayed or accelerated  our results for a particular quarterly period could be adversely affected 
our ability to establish pricing is subject to rapidly changing market and competitive conditions 
to be competitive and to avoid losing business on the basis of price  we must evaluate our pricing routinely 
there are instances where we may have to reduce our prices to obtain business 
market forces have and will continue to apply pressure on our gross margins and overall profitability 
our gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter based upon product mix 
product mix can affect our operating results 
for example  as we enjoy a higher gross margin on software than on hardware  our overall gross margin will vary depending upon the percentage of software licensed and the percentage of hardware sold each quarter 
the difficulty in predicting product mix on a quarter to quarter basis results in uncertainty in projecting gross margin  and we have experienced a degree of variability in our gross margins on a quarter to quarter basis as a result of changes in product mix 
our non major account business is difficult to predict 
our major account customers generally those customers who operate or more locations have longer sales cycles and deployments  our non major account sales have much shorter sales cycles and shorter deployments 
as a significant portion of our business involves non major accounts  there is inherent difficulty in predicting buying patterns 
accordingly  it is much harder to appropriately staff and prepare for fluctuations in buying demand for non major account customers 
this can result in inefficiencies that adversely affect our operating results 
some of the advanced systems we sell are very complex and require a high level of technical sophistication  which may result in increased costs that adversely affect our operating results 
the costs of the implementation and operation of an effective service structure capable of addressing increasingly complex software systems in wildly diverse locations is high and may require us to engage contractors  who generally have a higher cost structure than that of our own employees 
we incur additional costs due to the complexity of open systems  which generally incorporate third party software products that may entail difficult and costly support and service  and due to the difficulty in implementing  operating  maintaining and supporting centrally hosted systems  such as central reservation systems  and centrally hosted property management systems and reporting systems 
we are subject to certain material cost increases that may be out of our control 
while we attempt to control third party costs  we have little or no control over certain significant expenses  such as health care costs which are generally experience based and costs of compliance with new legislation 
significant increases in any of these expenses could adversely affect our operating results 
we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies and exchange rates 
because we conduct significant portions of our business in foreign currencies  we experience exchange rate fluctuations that can have a significant impact on our reported results 
for example  as much of our european business is transacted in euros  our revenue on a consolidated basis will decline if the euro weakens relative to the us dollar and increase if the euro strengthens relative to the us dollar 
we have a large exposure in europe 
micros has historically had a large presence in europe  with offices in most major european cities 
with the recent acquisition of torex  our presence in europe has increased 
given the uncertain economy of several member nations in the european union  and with mounting debt in certain european countries such as greece  spain  italy and portugal  we confront increased risk of customer defaults and decreased demand for our products 
as a publicly traded company  our stock price is subject to certain market trends that are out of our control and that may not reflect our actual operating performance 
we can experience short term increases and declines in our stock price due to factors other than those specific to our business  such as economic news or other events generally affecting the trading markets 
we have encountered risks associated with maintaining large cash balances 
while we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments generally considered to be relatively safe  we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks 
for example  we invested some of our cash in auction rate securities  which proved to be illiquid when the financial resale markets contracted in february these securities may continue to be illiquid 
moreover  we have recorded charges totaling million for credit losses relating to two of the auction rate securities in our investment portfolio  and we may  in the future  incur additional charges for losses related to our investments in auction rate securities 
in addition  bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess of federally insured amounts  if any 
technology risks 
our customers requirements are increasingly sophisticated 
to continue to offer competitive products and meet our customers requirements  we must continually develop and update our products 
unexpected costs and delays in development and implementation  and addressing our commitments to various customers  could adversely affect our financial results 
the development of software is an inherently difficult process that may result in software bugs that adversely impact a customer s business 
while we have a testing and beta program and protocol that we implement before the general release of any product  such processes cannot guarantee that the released software will not have any bugs 
our business could be adversely affected if these problems are significant and cannot readily be resolved 
the manufacturing of our hardware platform is performed primarily by a singapore based third party contract manufacturer  venture group of singapore formerly known as ges singapore venture group 
while we believe we have a good relationship with venture group  and have not experienced any material manufacturing problems with venture group  we cannot be certain that the relationship will remain in force  nor can we be certain that venture group will not experience labor or manufacturing challenges in the future  which may include claims of patent infringement with respect to key product components 
additionally  venture group procures many of its components from other third parties that could experience manufacturing or labor issues 
we believe that  if our relationship with venture group were to terminate  we could replace venture group with other contract manufacturers or resell appropriate third party hardware products in lieu of those manufactured for us by venture group 
however  any disruption or interruption of the supply of hardware products from venture group could materially adversely affect our business in the short run 
large customized deployments may be difficult and may result in cost overruns that are not recoverable 
we have some contracts under which we are required to provide systems and services at a fixed price 
we may be contractually required to absorb costs that may not be recoverable if we underestimate the amount of work required or if we encounter unanticipated technical issues 
this risk can be pronounced given the complexity of some of the systems we install and the size and scope of some of the deployments 
unanticipated costs that are not recoverable could adversely affect our operations 
our investment in certain technologies may prove to be unsuccessful and may delay our focus on more promising technologies 
we make significant investments in research and development 
our investments entail a risk that we will pursue technologies that we ultimately determine are not marketable or do not achieve the desired solution 
in such an event  we may be required to write off our investment  which could have an adverse impact on our operating income 
moreover  if we are delayed in deploying viable technologies  our business also could be adversely affected 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities 
our software may be used in connection with processing sensitive data eg  credit card numbers  and is sometimes used to store such data 
it may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures 
in those instances  the customer may attempt to seek damages from us 
while we believe that all of our current software comply with applicable industry security requirements and that we take appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our support and other systems  we cannot assure that our customers systems will not be breached  or that all unauthorized access can be prevented 
if a customer  or other person  seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach  our business could be adversely affected 
hosting of software applications presents increased security risks 
as we expand our software hosting capabilities and offer more of our software applications to our customers on a hosted basis  our responsibility for data and system security increases significantly 
while we believe that our current software applications comply with applicable laws and industry security requirements  and that we use appropriate security measures to reduce the possibility of unauthorized access or misuse of data in the hosting center  we cannot provide absolute assurance that our hosted systems will not be breached  or that all unauthorized access can be prevented 
if a security breach were to occur  a customer  regulatory agency  or other person could seek redress from us  which could adversely affect our business 
hosting of software applications presents other increased liability risks 
additionally  as we expand our software hosting capabilities and offer more of our software applications to our customers on a hosted basis  our potential liability increases significantly 
specifically  an outage in our data centers can affect literally thousands of customers  resulting in losses to both micros and the impacted customers 
while we believe that our data centers have been designed and engineered to reduce the likelihood of outages  we cannot provide assurance that our hosted systems will not suffer from unanticipated outages or deficient performance 
if an unanticipated outage were to occur  one or more customers could suffer economic damages and seek redress from us  which could adversely affect our business 
rapidly evolving mobile technologies present both opportunities and risks 
there has been a marked advancement in mobile technologies over the past year 
while this evolution offers us the opportunity to develop and sell new mobile products for the benefit of our customers  it also creates certain risks 
for example  some of the new mobile technology is untested and may cause unanticipated business interruption or unforeseen security risks 
additionally  there are many new entrants into the markets we serve  which may create confusion and additional competitive pressures 
resource and personnel risks 
we could be adversely affected by vendor labor difficulties 
some of our vendors may have employees who are protected by labor laws or who may be members of unions 
we could experience unanticipated manufacturing or supply shortages if any of our key vendors are subject to labor difficulties or work slow downs or stoppages 
our inability to hire qualified personnel  including particularly research development personnel  could adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer requirements on an efficient basis 
finding qualified technical personnel in all the localities where our research and development facilities are located is an ongoing challenge 
if we cannot find appropriate personnel  we risk delays in satisfying customer demands  or may even lose the opportunity to provide software to the customer 
if we are required to retain a consultant because we do not have available personnel  development costs would increase 
in general  our inability to recruit and retain appropriate personnel would adversely affect our business 
our internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that all frauds will be detected 
while we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective  a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met  and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within our company have been detected 
legal risks 
although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology  these protections do not preclude competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
we cannot guarantee that we can effectively preserve the proprietary nature and competitive advantages of our products  despite our efforts to do so through a combination of trade secrets  copyright  trademark law  non disclosure agreements  and technical measures 
others could attempt to copy what we have developed  either through legal or illegal means 
moreover  others have been able to develop competitive products and services that do not violate our proprietary rights 
we are subject to litigation  which may be costly 
as a company that does business with many customers  employees  and vendors throughout the world  we are subject to litigation  including claims made by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses 
while we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation and damages  litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse effect on our business 
as part of the litigation risk  we could be subject to potentially material adverse judgments 
we are subject to claims by others that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
from time to time we receive letters from entities that assert that we are infringing a patent 
in those instances  we assess the validity of the claims and the purported patent  and determine whether a license is appropriate or necessary 
if we conclude that a license is not necessary  there is a risk that we will be sued  we may also face indirect liability as a result of infringement claims brought against our customers 
while we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights  we have from time to time and may continue to become involved in infringement litigation 
if that occurs  we may incur significant legal expenses and  if we are found liable  we could be obligated to pay significant damages or enter into unfavorable license agreements 
credit card issuers have promulgated credit card security guidelines as part of their ongoing effort to battle identity theft and credit card fraud  which may substantially increase our expenses  breaches of our customers credit card security may adversely affect us 
we continue to work with credit card issuers to assure that our products and services comply with the credit card associations security regulations and best practices applicable to our products and services 
we cannot assure  however  that our products and services are invulnerable to unauthorized access or hacking 
additionally  we cannot assure that our customers will implement all of the credit card security features that we introduce  or all of the protections and procedures required by the credit card issuers 
our customers may not establish and maintain appropriate levels of firewall protection and other security measures 
if there is unauthorized access to credit card data that results in financial loss  there is a potential that parties could seek damages from us 
additionally  changes in the security guidelines and laws relating to consumer privacy could require significant  unanticipated  and costly development efforts

item legal proceedings on may   a jury returned verdicts against us in the consolidated actions of roth cash register v 
micros systems  inc  et al 
and shenango systems solutions v 
micros systems  inc  et al 
the cases initially were filed in in the court of common pleas of allegheny county  pennsylvania 
the complaints both related to the non renewal of dealership agreements in the year between us and the respective plaintiffs 
the agreements were non renewed as part of a restructuring of the dealer channel 
the plaintiffs alleged that we and certain of our subsidiaries and employees entered into a plan to eliminate the plaintiffs as authorized dealers and improperly interfere with the plaintiffs relationships with their respective existing and potential future clients and customers without compensation to the plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs claimed that  as a result  we were liable for  among other things  breach of contract and tortious interference with existing and prospective contractual relationships 
both we and the plaintiffs appealed the verdicts on various grounds 
on december   the superior court of pennsylvania issued an opinion reversing and remanding million of the award and affirming the remaining million of the award  at which point we accrued a charge of million in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
both we and the plaintiffs appealed the superior court decision on various grounds 
on april   the pennsylvania supreme court denied all of the petitions for appeal 
the matter was accordingly remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the superior court decision 
on june   we paid an aggregate of approximately million to the two plaintiffs  reflecting all amounts that were determined to be owed to the plaintiff in the shenango case and all amounts that were no longer in dispute to the plaintiff in the roth case  including as to each payment i interest that accrued at the statutory rate of per annum  and ii certain reductions and offsets that were approved by the court of common pleas 
the remaining amounts in dispute in the roth case are not material 
we are and have been involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business  and we are of the opinion  based upon presently available information and the advice of counsel concerning pertinent legal matters  that any resulting liability should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
however  litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and the outcome of litigation is not predictable with assurance 
an adverse outcome in current or future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity

our management views the us canada and international segments separately in operating our business  although the products and services are similar for each segment 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we reevaluate our estimates periodically 
the following comprise the critical accounting estimates that we used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue is generated from the sale of software licenses  hardware  services and support and is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  or services have been rendered  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and collectability of the related receivable is probable 
in making judgments regarding revenue recognition  we analyze various factors  including the nature and terms of the specific transaction  the nature and terms of comparable transactions  the creditworthiness of our customers  our historical experience  accuracy of prior estimates  and overall market and economic condition 
moreover  in connection with sales of a number of products and services under a single contractual arrangements a multiple element arrangement  we make judgments as to whether there is sufficient vendor specific objective evidence to enable the allocation of fair value among the various elements in software arrangements that contain multiple elements and as to relative selling prices for multiple element arrangements that contain hardware or other non software elements 
in determining relative selling prices for products and services  we consider  among other things  the customer s geographic location  customer concentrations  our use of discounts from list prices  prices we charge for similar offerings and our historical pricing practices 
changes in judgments related to these items  or a deterioration in market or economic conditions  could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our methodology for determining this allowance requires estimates and is based on the age of the receivable  customer payment practices and history  inquiries regarding the customer  credit reports from third parties and other financial information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which could affect our financial results in future periods 
as of june  and  accounts receivable totaled approximately million and million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  bad debt expense for fiscal years  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out pricing method 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
nevertheless  changes in business trends  competition and other factors not apparent when  or occurring after  we make our estimates of inventory obsolescence could result in the need to undertake additional inventory write offs in future periods 
we wrote down our inventory by approximately million and million as of june  and  respectively 
financial instruments and fair value measurements all of our short term investments are recorded at fair value  which approximates cost 
our investments in auction rate securities debt instruments designed to have periodic interest rate resets  classified as long term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as discussed below  are carried at fair value 
we periodically review our financial instruments to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss 
unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary in nature are reported  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
other than temporary credit loss loss due to security issuer s credit risk  net of tax and valuation allowances  is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations  while other than temporary impairment loss related to factors other than credit loss  net of tax  is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we periodically assess whether we would likely recover the entire cost basis of each of our auction rate securities  and  therefore  whether the securities had incurred an other than temporary impairment 
the factors considered in classifying the impairment include a the credit quality of the underlying security  b the extent to which and time period during which the fair value of each investment has been below cost  c the expected holding or recovery period for each investment  d our intent to hold each investment until recovery  the likelihood that we will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery and our expectation of recovery of the entire amortized cost basis of the security  and e the existence of any evidence of default by the issuer 
applying these factors entails significant judgment and considerable uncertainty 
we then estimate the extent to which other than temporary credit loss or non credit loss was applicable to our investments in auction rate securities 
because there is no liquid market or negotiated transaction history with regard to the auction rate securities  we engaged an independent valuation firm to perform a valuation of our investments in auction rate securities at june  the valuation firm used a discounted cash flow model that considered various inputs including a the coupon rate specified under the debt instruments  b the current credit ratings of the underlying issuers  c collateral characteristics  d discount rates  e severity of default and f probability that the securities will be sold at auction or through early redemption 
we reviewed and agreed with this valuation 
the fair value assessment also included an evaluation of the amount of the other than temporary impairment attributable to credit loss  which  as noted above  is recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
the factors considered in making an evaluation of the amount attributable to credit loss include the following a default probability and the likelihood of restructuring of the security  b payment structure of the security to determine how the expected underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to holders of the issuer s securities and c performance indicators of the underlying collateral held in the issuer trust including default and delinquency rates 
many of the assumptions utilized in connection with the valuation  and our fair value measurements generally  are subject to considerable uncertainty  and changes in assumptions or subsequent events could result in the recognition of additional credit loss 
a change in factors  including economic conditions  rates of default with respect to the obligations underlying the securities  our liquidity needs  and a variety of other factors may cause our future valuation results to differ  in which case our financial results in future periods could be affected significantly 
capitalized software development costs costs incurred in the research and development of new software products to be licensed to others  primarily consisting of salaries  employee benefits and administrative costs  are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses until technological feasibility is established 
the capitalization of software development costs on a product by product basis starts when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized software development costs begins 
technological feasibility is established when the product reaches the working model stage 
the cost of purchased software is also capitalized 
annual amortization of capitalized software development costs is either included in software cost of sales or service cost of sales 
for each capitalized software product  the annual amortization is equal to the greater of i the amount computed using the ratio that the software product s current fiscal year gross revenue bears to the total current fiscal year and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or ii the amount computed based on the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
if we incorrectly estimate the remaining economic life of a product or the anticipated future gross revenues of a product  we may in the future be required to take a significant write off of capitalized software development costs or to accelerate amortization  either of which could materially affect our future financial results 
amortization expenses for fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets we evaluate long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
when indicators of impairment are present  we compare the fair value of the relevant asset groups  based on the undiscounted cash flows the asset groups are expected to generate or market value  if available  to the net book value of the asset groups 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  the asset group is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the net book value over the fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the asset groups for the purposes of our analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these asset groups 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the company 
a change in assumptions and estimates in future periods could cause us to determine that asset groups are impaired  resulting in a significant charge in future periods 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we assess annually  in the first quarter of the fiscal year  whether goodwill and certain of our trademarks  which are our only indefinite lived purchased intangible assets  are impaired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units our four operating segments consisting of us canada  europe  the pacific rim and latin america to their book value 
we first determine  based on a qualitative assessment  whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on a weighting of future income approach ie  discounted future income and market approach ie  a comparison to the purchase and sale of similar assets in the relevant industry 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if goodwill is impaired  we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances indicating that it is more likely than not that the book value of goodwill and or trademarks has been impaired 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
qualitative assessments regarding goodwill involve a high degree of judgment and can entail subjective considerations 
our estimates of the fair value of the reporting units for the purposes of our annual or interim analyses  require estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying reporting units and factor in assumptions on revenue and expense growth rates 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity  including assumptions relating to customer demand  changes in technology and the cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues 
additionally  these cash flow analyses factor in expected amounts of working capital and weighted average cost of capital 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the reporting unit 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date the analysis is performed 
a determination that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired which could result from a change in our assumptions could have a significant impact on our operating results 
as of june  and  goodwill totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
see note  acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation we account for our option awards granted under our stock option program by estimating fair value of option awards as of the date of grant 
non cash share based compensation expenses  which are based on the estimated value of the option awards adjusted for expected pre vesting forfeitures  are recognized ratably over the requisite service ie vesting period of options in the consolidated statement of operations 
we value stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that are fully transferable and have no vesting restrictions 
therefore  we are required to input highly subjective assumptions about volatility rates  expected term of options  dividend yields and applicable interest rates in determining the estimated fair value 
expected volatility is based on historical stock prices 
the expected term of options granted is based on historical option activities  adjusted for the remaining option life cycle by assuming ratable exercise of any unexercised vested options over the remaining term 
for this purpose  we separate groups of employees that have historically exhibited similar behavior with regard to option exercises and post vesting cancellations 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
total share based compensation expense recorded from period to period can be significantly different depending on several variables  including the number of options granted  any changes to assumptions such as pre vesting cancellations and the estimated fair value of those vested awards 
however  unlike all of the other accounting estimates described in this section  changes in estimates regarding stock options affect only newly granted options  they do not result in a change in previously recorded amounts 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which the determination is made 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities could be materially affected if  based on subsequent events  we determine that we must derecognize or recognize a tax position 
in connection with the purchase price allocation for the torex acquisition  we have established a gross deferred tax asset of approximately million primarily related to torex uk s net operating loss carryforwards 
the future realization of the deferred tax asset is based on recent profitability and our current forecast of torex operations 
however  if torex s operations experience a significant change  whether due to future operational integration and reorganization or otherwise  we may not be able to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards 
to the extent that we are unable to use some portion of the loss carryforwards in future periods  we would be required to recognize an increase to tax expense  which could materially affect our annual tax rate in the year in which the change occurs 
although we are profitable on a consolidated basis  we have incurred losses in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we applied valuation allowances in some circumstances where the prospects of realizing the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred taxes are subject to uncertainty 
the determination of the likelihood of realizing this tax benefit requires significant judgment in some instances  and actual results of our operating subsidiaries  particularly certain international subsidiaries  could require material adjustments to our deferred tax assets or liabilities  and changes in our annual tax rate in the year in which the adjustments occur 
we review our uncertain income tax positions and apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions 
our net unrecognized income tax benefits were approximately million and million  including interest and penalties of approximately million and million at june  and  respectively 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax positions and evaluating uncertainties relating to these positions 
changes in estimates regarding our tax positions  or government determinations resulting from tax audits  could have an effect on our deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as our annual tax rate in the year in which the changes or determinations occur 
results of operations during the three fiscal years ending june   we acquired several businesses  including torex  and accordingly  our results include activities from the acquired businesses from their respective acquisition dates 
as torex was acquired on may   the results of these acquisitions did not have a material effect on our overall results during those three fiscal years

the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to increases in tax benefits realized upon the expiration of statutes of limitation or settlements with tax authorities and the net reduction of valuation allowances 
we recorded net unrecognized income tax benefits of approximately million and million  including accrued interest and penalties of approximately million and million at june  and  respectively 
we have recognized approximately million and million of interest expense for the fiscal years and  respectively 
the non current portion of the net unrecognized income tax benefits represents benefits with respect to which we do not anticipate making a payment within months of the balance sheet date

we have recognized a net decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to fiscal year  which includes a reduction in the effective tax rate of and income tax expense by approximately million  primarily due to the expiration of statutes of limitations 
we estimate that within the next months  we will decrease the unrecognized income tax benefits by between approximately million to million due to the expiration of statues of limitations and settlement of issues with tax authorities  which we believe would increase earnings as a result of a reduction in tax expense 
however  audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty

based on our expected operating cash flows and sources of cash  we do not believe that any limitations on liquidity of our auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs 
in light of current economic conditions generally and in light of the overall performance of the stock market in recent periods  we cannot assume that funds would be available from other sources if we were required to fund significant acquisitions or any unanticipated and substantial cash needs 
we currently anticipate that our property  plant and equipment expenditures for fiscal year will be approximately million

there are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
these may include changes in applicable laws and regulations  other activities of governments  governmental agencies  or other regulatory bodies that affect our products  services  or business operations  changes in accounting and auditing rules and changes in the interpretations of those rules  as well as those matters described in item a  risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk and to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
see foreign sales and foreign market risks in part business  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  above for information regarding foreign currency exchange risks 
our committed lines of credit bear interest at a floating rate  which exposes us to interest rate risks 
we manage our exposure to this risk by minimizing  to the extent feasible  overall borrowing and monitoring available financing alternatives 
at june   we had no borrowings and had not entered into any instruments to hedge the resulting exposure to interest rate risk 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future with increases in the outstanding amount under the line of credit 
as we did not have any borrowing as of june   a change in interest rate would have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities  including auction rate securities  are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
the market value of fixed interest rate securities may be adversely affected by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
should interest rates fluctuate by  the change in value of our marketable securities would not have been material as of june   but the change in our interest income would have been a change of approximately million based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as of june  for the year then ended 
to minimize our exposure to credit risk associated with financial instruments  we place our temporary cash investments with high credit quality institutions  generally with bond rating of a and above
