table of contents customers and strategic relationships we sell our products to leading wired and wireless communications manufacturers 
we have also established strategic relationships with multiservice operators that provide wired and wireless communications services to consumers and businesses 
customers currently shipping wired and or wireless communications equipment and devices incorporating our products include alcatel motorola apple netgear cisco nokia dell pace echostar samsung hewlett packard technicolor huawei technologies zte lg a small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenue 
sales to our five largest customers represented  and of our net revenue in  and  respectively 
in sales to apple and samsung represented and of our net revenue  respectively 
in  sales to apple and samsung represented and of our net revenue  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
we expect that our key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and in the foreseeable future 
these customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel  change or defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
research and development we have assembled a large team of experienced engineers and technologists  many of whom are leaders in their particular field or discipline 
as of december  we had approximately  research and development employees  including over employees with phds these key employees are involved in advancing our core technologies  as well as product development 
because soc solutions benefit from the same underlying core technologies  we are able to address a wide range of communications markets with a relatively focused investment in research and development 
our research and development expense was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
these amounts included stock based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we believe that increased ip integration and the timely introduction of new products are essential to our growth 
while we endeavor to manage our costs and expenses to attain our long term business objectives  we plan to maintain significant research and development staffing levels for the foreseeable future 
we have design centers throughout the united states  including our principal design facilities in irvine  california and santa clara county  california 
internationally  we have design facilities in asia  europe  israel and canada 
we anticipate establishing additional design centers in the united states and in other countries 

table of contents manufacturing wafer fabrication we depend on multiple foundry subcontractors located in asia to manufacture a majority of our products 
our key silicon foundries are taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation in taiwan  globalfoundries  inc formerly chartered semiconductor manufacturing in singapore  semiconductor manufacturing international corporation in china  and united microelectronics corporation in singapore and taiwan 
by subcontracting manufacturing  we focus resources on design and test applications where we believe we have greater competitive advantages 
this strategy also eliminates the high cost of owning and operating semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities 
see risk factors under item a of this report for a discussion of the risks associated with our dependence on independent foundry subcontractors 
most of our products are manufactured using cmos process technology 
our products are currently fabricated on a variety of processes ranging from nanometers to nanometers 
we generally evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies 
approximately of our products are currently manufactured in nanometers 
we are designing most new products in nanometers and nanometers  and are beginning to evaluate nanometers 
see risk factors under item a of this report for a discussion of the risks associated with transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies 
assembly and test our products are tested either at the wafer level and or packaged finished products level 
our product testing is conducted by independent foundries  and independent test subcontractors 
the die are assembled into finished products by independent assembly and package subcontractors 
a majority of our test and assembly is performed by the following independent subcontractors united test and assembly center in singapore  china and thailand test  assembly and packaging  advanced semiconductor engineering ase in china and taiwan test  assembly and packaging  siliconware precision in taiwan test  assembly and packaging  amkor in korea  philippines  taiwan and china assembly and packaging only  signetics in korea assembly and packaging only  statschippac in singapore  korea  malaysia and china test  assembly and packaging  see risk factors under item a of this report for a discussion of the risks associated with our dependence on third party assembly and test subcontractors 
quality assurance we focus on product reliability from the initial stage of the design cycle through each specific design process  including layout and production test design 
our operations and quality engineering teams closely manage the interface between manufacturing and design engineering 
we prequalify each assembly and foundry subcontractor 
we also participate in quality and reliability monitoring by reviewing electrical and parametric data from our wafer foundry and assembly subcontractors 
we closely monitor wafer foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality  reliability and yield levels 
all of our principal independent foundries and package assembly facilities are currently iso certified  a comprehensive international standards organization specified quality system acknowledgement 
as part of our total quality program  we received iso certification for our singapore distribution facility 
environmental management we monitor the environmental impact of our products 
our manufacturing subcontractors have registered our manufacturing flow to iso  the international standard related to environmental management 
lead free solutions in electronic components and systems are receiving increasing attention within the semiconductor industry 

table of contents our products are compliant with the restriction of hazardous substances directive  or rohs  the european legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances  including lead  and current european reach regulation  evaluation and authorization of chemicals laws 
product distribution the majority of our products are distributed internationally to customers through our distribution center in singapore and a smaller portion domestically via an operations and distribution center in irvine  california 
net product revenue derived from actual shipments to international destinations  primarily in asia represented  and of our net revenue in  and  respectively 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to achieve design wins with technology leaders by providing quality  state of the art products  superior engineering execution  and superior sales  field application and engineering support 
we market and sell our products in the united states through a direct sales force  distributors and manufacturers representatives 
the majority of our domestic sales occur through our direct sales force  which is based in offices located in california and throughout the united states 
we market and sell our products internationally through regional offices in asia  europe and north america  as well as through a network of independent and fulfillment distributors and representatives in asia  australia  europe and north america 
we or our customers select these independent entities based on their ability to provide effective field sales  marketing communications and technical support to our customers 
all international sales to date have been in us dollars 
we present revenue from independent customers by geographic area in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
backlog our sales are primarily made through standard purchase orders for delivery of products 
due to industry practice that allows customers to cancel  change or defer orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment  we do not believe that backlog is a reliable indicator of future revenue levels 
competition the semiconductor industry in general  and wired and wireless communications markets in particular  are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid change  evolving standards  short product life cycles and price erosion 
we believe that the principal factors of competition for integrated circuit providers include product quality and reputation market presence product capabilities standards compliance level of integration system cost engineering execution intellectual property reliability customer interface and support price time to market we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
we compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications 
we also compete with suppliers of system level and motherboard level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than broadcom 
this competition has resulted and will continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products in certain markets 
we also may face competition from newly established competitors  suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies  and customers that choose to develop their own silicon solutions 
we expect to encounter continuing consolidation in the markets in which we compete 
some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution and other resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to 
table of contents adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties  and may refuse to provide us with information necessary to permit the interoperability of our products with theirs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
in addition  competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features  lower power requirements or lower costs 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk factors under item a of this report for further discussion of the risks associated with competition 
seasonality an increasing number of our products are being incorporated into consumer electronic products  which are subject to significant seasonality and fluctuations in demand  and tend to have stronger sales in the middle of the fiscal year as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons 
intellectual property our success and future product revenue growth depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
however  these may not provide meaningful or adequate protection for our intellectual property 
we currently hold more than  us and more than  foreign patents up from more than  us and more than  foreign patents from the prior year and have more than  additional us and foreign pending patent applications 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners  and typically control access to and distribution of product documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain  copy  use or disclose our technologies and processes  develop similar technology independently  or design around our patents 
as such  any rights granted under our patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully enforce our patents against infringing products in every jurisdiction 
see risk factors under item a of this report for further discussion of the risks associated with patents and intellectual property 
some or all of our patents have in the past been licensed and likely will in the future be licensed to certain of our competitors through cross license agreements  such as the qualcomm agreement 
see the detailed discussion in the overview section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  because we have participated and continue to participate in developing various industry standards  we may be required to license some of our patents to others  including competitors  who develop products based on those standards 
companies in and related to the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
we are currently engaged in litigation and may need to engage in additional litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers  to protect our trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
in addition  we are currently engaged in litigation and may engage in future litigation with parties that claim that we infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets 
such litigation will result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for a detailed description of our outstanding intellectual property litigation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
employees as of december  we had approximately  employees  including  individuals engaged in research and development  engaged in sales and marketing  engaged in manufacturing operations  and 
table of contents engaged in general and administrative activities 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe our employee relations are good 
item a 
risk factors before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on broadcom  our business  financial condition  results of operations and or liquidity could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our class a common stock will likely decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter 
variability in the nature of our operating results may be attributed to the factors identified throughout this risk factors section  many of which may be outside our control  including changes in economic conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry  seasonality in sales of consumer and enterprise products in which our products are incorporated  our dependence on a few significant customers and or design wins for a substantial portion of our revenue  timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  changes in customer product needs and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures and other factors such as the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products  the impact of a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake  severe weather  tsunami or other flooding  or a nuclear crisis  as well as interruptions or shortages in the supply of utilities such as water and electricity  on a key location such as our corporate headquarters or our northern california facilities  both of which are located near major earthquake fault lines  and the impact of tax examinations 
we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a relatively small number of customers 
sales to our five largest customers represented  and of our total net revenue for   and  respectively 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total net revenue for the foreseeable future 
the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our revenue in any period may also depend on a single product design win with a large customer 
as a result  the loss of any such key design win or any significant delay in the ramp of volume production of the customer s products into which our product is designed could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to maintain sales to certain of our key customers or continue to secure key design wins for a variety of reasons  including agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  and our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty 
in addition  the majority of our licensing revenues and related income to date has been derived from agreements with two customers  verizon wireless and qualcomm 
from january through december  we recorded million in licensing revenue and related income derived from verizon wireless and qualcomm and we expect 
table of contents to record an additional million 
the licensing revenue from our agreement with verizon wireless has ended and the income from the qualcomm agreement is non recurring and will terminate in there can be no assurances that we will be able to enter into additional such arrangements in the future  or that we will be able to successfully collect the remaining payments due to us under the qualcomm agreement in the event of a default by qualcomm 
the loss of a key customer or design win  a reduction in sales to any key customer  decrease in licensing revenue  significant delay in our customers product development plans  or our inability to attract new significant customers or secure new key design wins could seriously impact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we face intense competition 
the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets are intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase as new markets develop  as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our business 
we expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories and presences in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do  and in some cases operate their own fabrication facilities 
these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
we also face competition from newly established competitors  suppliers of products  and customers who choose to develop their own semiconductor solutions 
existing or new competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality  lower power requirements  greater levels of integration or lower cost 
increased competition also has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in increased expenditures on research and development  declining average selling prices  reduced gross margins and loss of market share in certain markets 
these factors in turn create increased pressure to consolidate 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or new competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  we may lose market share in our existing markets and our revenues may fail to increase or may decline 
we face risks associated with our acquisition strategy 
a key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses  assets  products or technologies 
the expansion of our business through acquisitions allows us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
we may not be able to identify or consummate future acquisitions or realize the desired benefit from these acquisitions 
we face a number of challenges associated with our acquisition strategy that could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management team  including delays in the timing and successful integration of an acquired company s technologies  the loss of key personnel  if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are less favorable than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges  lower gross margins  revenues and operating income than originally anticipated at the time of acquisition and other financial challenges  and becoming subject to intellectual property or other litigation 
acquisitions can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities 
while we believe we will have the ability to service any additional debt we may potentially issue in connection with acquisitions  our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic 
table of contents conditions  industry cycles  and business and other factors affecting our operations  including the other risk factors described in this section  many of which are beyond our control 
acquisitions can also result in adverse tax consequences  warranty or product liability exposure related to acquired assets  additional stock based compensation expense  write up of acquired inventory to fair value  and the recording and later amortization of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets 
in addition  we may record goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with an acquisition and incur impairment charges in the future 
each of the above may apply equally to our pending acquisition of netlogic microsystems  inc  which is our largest acquisition to date 
we may fail to adjust our operations in response to changes in demand 
through internal growth and acquisitions  we significantly modified the scope of our operations and workforce in recent years 
our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term  such as research and development expenses and our highly skilled workforce 
during some periods  our growth has placed a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
to respond to periods of increased demand  we will be required to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
alternatively  in response to the economic downturn in the markets in the semiconductor industry and communications market  we may be required to implement restructuring actions and a number of other cost saving measures 
all of these endeavors require substantial management effort 
if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations  we may be unable to adjust our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  or conversely  we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue  either of which would materially and adversely affect our current or future business 
our operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address 
we operate primarily in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards 
from time to time  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns characterized by decreases in product demand  excess customer inventories and accelerated erosion of prices 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our ability to ship products 
an increasing number of our products are being incorporated into consumer electronic products  which are subject to significant seasonality and fluctuations in demand 
economic volatility can cause extreme difficulties for our customers and vendors in accurately forecasting and planning future business activities 
this unpredictability could cause our customers to reduce spending on our products and services  which would delay and lengthen sales cycles 
furthermore  during challenging economic times our customers and vendors may face challenges in gaining timely access to sufficient credit  which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us 
as a result  we may experience growth patterns that are different than the end demand for products  particularly during periods of high volatility 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery or the impact of such events on our customers  our vendors or us 
the combination of our lengthy sales cycle coupled with challenging macroeconomic conditions and supply chain cross dependencies could have a compound impact on our business 
the impact of market volatility is not limited to revenue but may also affect our product gross margins and other financial metrics 
any downturn in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged  and any failure of the industry or wired and wireless communications markets to fully recover from downturns could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our class a common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
from january  through december  our class a common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control 
in addition  the market prices of securities of internet related  semiconductor and other technology companies have been and remain volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many 
table of contents technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results  the market price of our class a common stock will likely decline 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  we  and other companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities  have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
due to the nature of our compensation programs  most of our executive officers sell shares of our common stock each quarter or otherwise periodically  often pursuant to trading plans established under rule b promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act 
as a result  sales of shares by our executive officers may not be indicative of their respective opinions of broadcom s performance at the time of sale or of our potential future performance 
nonetheless  the market price of our stock may be affected by sales of shares by our executive officers 
we may be required to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of others and or may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights 
companies in the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we receive notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
additionally  we receive notices that challenge the validity of our patents 
intellectual property litigation can be expensive  time consuming and distracting to management 
an adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products or could prevent us from enforcing our intellectual property rights 
we may also be required to indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
we have received requests from certain customers and strategic partners to include increasingly broad indemnification provisions in our agreements with them 
these indemnification provisions may  in some circumstances  extend our liability beyond the products we provide to include liability for combinations of components or system level designs and for consequential damages and or lost profits 
even if claims or litigation against us are not valid or successfully asserted  these claims could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management and other key employees to defend 
our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors  suppliers or customers 
we may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
our contractors  suppliers and licensors may not be required to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us  or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount  above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages 
any of these claims or litigation may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain  copy  use or disclose our technologies and processes 
any of our existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
we engage in litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
if our intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our technology  our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours 
our software may be derived from open source software  which is generally made available to the public by its authors and or other third parties 
open source software is often made available under licenses  which impose certain obligations in the event we distribute derivative works of the open source software 
these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public  and or license such derivative works on different terms than those customarily used to protect our intellectual property 
with respect to our proprietary software  we generally license such software under terms that prohibit combining it with open source software 
despite these restrictions  parties may combine our proprietary software with open source software without our authorization  in which case we might nonetheless be required to release the source code of our proprietary software 

table of contents we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners 
we also control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  internal or external parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
additionally  current  departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our computer systems and networks to misappropriate our proprietary information and technology or interrupt our business 
because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate  counter or ameliorate these techniques 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will succeed 
identifying unauthorized use of our products and technologies is difficult and time consuming 
the initiation of litigation may adversely affect our relationships and agreements with certain customers that have a stake in the outcome of the litigation proceedings 
litigation is very expensive and may divert the attention of management and other key employees from the operation of the business  which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties 
it is difficult to accurately predict demand for our semiconductor products 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
customers can generally cancel  change or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
our ability to accurately forecast customer demand is further impaired by delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle 
we operate in a dynamic industry and use significant resources to develop new products for existing and new markets 
after we have developed a product  there is no guarantee that our customers will integrate our product into their equipment or devices and  ultimately  bring those equipment and devices incorporating our product to market 
in these situations  we may never produce or deliver a significant number of our products  even after incurring substantial development expenses 
from the time a customer elects to integrate our solution into their product  it is typically six to months before high volume production of that product commences 
after volume production begins  we cannot be assured that the equipment or devices incorporating our product will gain market acceptance 
our products are incorporated into complex devices and systems  creating supply chain cross dependencies 
accordingly  supply chain disruptions affecting components of our customers devices and or systems could negatively impact the demand for our products  even if the supply of our products is not directly affected 
our product demand forecasts are based on multiple assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
in the event we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell 
as a result  we could hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available  we could forego revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
also  due to our industry s shift to just in time inventory management  any disruption in the supply chain could lead to more immediate shortages in product or component supply 
in addition  an increasing percentage of our inventory is maintained under hubbing arrangements whereby products are delivered to a customer or third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs 
under these arrangements  we do not recognize product revenue until the customer reports that it has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products 
our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired under our hubbing arrangements  which could increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete product inventory and negatively impact our cash flow 
we manufacture and sell complex products and may be unable to successfully develop and introduce new products 
we expect that a high percentage of our future sales will come from sales of new products 
we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
the markets for some of these products are new to us and may be immature and or unpredictable 
these markets may not develop into profitable opportunities and we have invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected 
as a result  it is difficult to anticipate our future revenue streams from  or the sustainability of  our new products 

table of contents our industry is dynamic and we are required to devote significant resources to research and development to remain competitive 
the development of new silicon devices is highly complex  and due to supply chain cross dependencies and other issues  we may experience delays in completing the development  production and introduction of our new products 
we may choose to discontinue one or more products or product development programs to dedicate more resources to other products 
the discontinuation of an existing or planned product may adversely affect our relationship with one or more of our customers 
our ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors  including our ability to effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets  timely complete and introduce new integrated products  transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries  license any desired third party technology or intellectual property rights  obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials  and qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products 
if we are not able to develop and introduce new products in a cost effective and timely manner  we will be unable to attract new customers or to retain our existing customers which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we have experienced hardware and software defects and bugs associated with the introduction of our highly complex products 
if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products 
these problems could interrupt or delay sales and shipments of our products to customers 
to alleviate these problems  we may have to divert our resources from other development efforts 
in addition  these problems could result in claims against us by our customers or others  including possible claims for consequential damages and or lost profits 
we are exposed to risks associated with our international operations 
we currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside the united states 
products shipped to international destinations  primarily in asia  represented  and of our product revenue in  and  respectively 
in addition  we undertake various sales and marketing activities through regional offices in a number of countries 
we intend to continue expanding our international business activities and to open other design and operational centers abroad 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including but not limited to political  social and economic instability  exposure to different business practices and legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  continuation of overseas conflicts and the risk of terrorist attacks and resulting heightened security  the imposition of governmental controls and restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  nationalization of business and blocking of cash flows  changes in taxation and tariffs  and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
economic conditions in our primary overseas markets  particularly in asia  may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad 
also  all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies 
we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 
we depend on third parties to fabricate  assemble and test our products 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we do not own or operate fabrication  assembly or test facilities 
we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble and test substantially all of our semiconductor devices 
accordingly  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance 
this lack of control could result in 
table of contents product shortages or quality assurance problems 
these issues could delay shipments of our products or increase our assembly or testing costs 
in addition  the consolidation of foundry subcontractors  as well as the increasing capital intensity and complexity associated with fabrication in smaller process geometries may limit our diversity of suppliers  potentially driving increased wafer prices and adversely affecting our results of operations  including our product gross margins 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our direct or indirect suppliers  including our manufacturing  assembly or test subcontractors 
we typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis 
in the event our third party foundry subcontractors experience a disruption or limitation of manufacturing  assembly or testing capacity  we may not be able to obtain alternative manufacturing  assembly and testing services in a timely manner  or at all 
furthermore  our foundries must have new manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process  which could be time consuming 
we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative manufactures  assemblers or testers for our products 
we are continuing to develop relationships with additional third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
because we rely on outside foundries and other third party suppliers  we face several significant risks in addition to those discussed above  including a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints  the limited availability of  or potential delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies  and the location of foundries and other suppliers in regions that are subject to earthquakes  tsunamis and other natural disasters 
the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields 
this often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start up of new process technologies 
in addition  we are dependent on our foundry subcontractors to successfully transition to smaller geometry processes 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 
in january  our board of directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which broadcom would pay quarterly dividends on our common stock 
in january  our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend payment 
we intend to continue to pay such dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of broadcom applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends 
future dividends may be affected by  among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development  use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions  stock repurchase programs  changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws  and changes to our business model 
our dividend payments may change from time to time  and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend payment or declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all 
a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 
we may be unable to attract  retain or motivate key personnel 
our future success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate senior management and qualified technical personnel 
competition for these employees is intense 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate such personnel in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis  we will experience difficulty in implementing our current business and product plans 
in that event  we may be unable to successfully meet competitive challenges or to exploit potential market opportunities  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents government regulation may adversely affect our business 
the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may materially and adversely impact our business 
for example  the federal communications commission  or fcc  has broad jurisdiction in the united states over many of the devices into which our products are incorporated 
fcc regulatory policies that affect the ability of cable or satellite operators or telephone companies to offer certain services to their customers or other aspects of their business may impede sales of our products in the united states 
in addition  we may experience delays if a product incorporating our chips fails to comply with fcc emissions specifications 
we and our customers are subject to various import and export laws and regulations 
government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products 
if we fail to continue to receive licenses or otherwise comply with these regulations  we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at foreign foundries or ship these products to certain customers  or we may incur penalties or fines 
our business may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the united states 
foreign governments may impose tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
these tariffs  duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our product or manufacturing standards could also be impacted by new or revised environmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives 
for instance  the us securities and exchange commission proposed new disclosure requirements relating to the sourcing of certain minerals from the democratic republic of congo and certain other adjoining countries 
when these new requirements are in effect  they could adversely affect our costs  the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers 
our business is subject to potential tax liabilities 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to our interpretation and application of tax laws in jurisdictions in which we file 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  or the imposition of new or changed tax laws or regulations or new related interpretations by taxing authorities in the us or foreign jurisdictions  could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are subject to examinations and tax audits 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these audits will not have an adverse effect on our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards  our financial position  or our operating results 
in certain foreign jurisdictions  we operate under tax holidays and favorable tax incentives 
for instance  in singapore we operate under tax holidays  which are effective through march   that reduce taxes on substantially all of our operating income in that jurisdiction 
such tax holidays and incentives often require us to meet specified employment and investment criteria in such jurisdictions 
in a period of tight manufacturing capacity  our ability to meet singaporean content in our products may be more limited  which may have adverse tax consequences 
more generally  if any of our tax holidays or incentives are terminated or if we fail to meet the criteria to continue to enjoy such holidays or incentives  our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
we have begun discussions with the singapore economic development board with respect to tax incentives for periods after march  no assurances can be given that such discussions will be successful 
if we are unable to reach an agreement with singapore or another jurisdiction that provides similar benefits to those we realize from our current incentives in singapore  our results of operations and financial position for periods after march  will be adversely affected 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
for example  our board of directors may also issue shares of class b common stock in connection with certain acquisitions  which have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote as compared to one vote per share in the case of our class a common stock as well as the right to vote separately as a class 
in addition  our board of 
table of contents directors has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue shares of common or preferred stock without a shareholder vote 
these provisions  among others  may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control 
our co founders and their affiliates may control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders 
as of december  our co founders  directors  executive officers and their respective affiliates beneficially owned of our outstanding common stock and held of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
accordingly  these shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders 
these matters include the election of our board of directors  the issuance of additional shares of class b common stock  and the approval of most significant corporate transactions  including certain mergers and consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in particular  as of december  our two founders  dr 
henry t 
nicholas iii and dr 
henry samueli  beneficially owned a total of of our outstanding common stock and held of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
because of their significant voting stock ownership  we will not be able to engage in certain transactions  and our shareholders will not be able to effect certain actions or transactions  without the approval of one or both of these shareholders 
repurchases of shares of our class a common stock under our share repurchase program would result in an increase in the total voting power of our co founders  directors  executive officers and their affiliates  as well as other continuing shareholders

our product revenue consists principally of sales of semiconductor devices and  to a lesser extent  software licenses and royalties  development  support and maintenance agreements  data services and cancellation fees 
the majority of our product sales occur through the efforts of our direct sales force 
the remaining balance of our product sales occurs through distributors 
our licensing revenue and income is generated from the licensing of our intellectual property  of which the vast majority to date has been derived from agreements with two customers  verizon wireless and qualcomm 
the licensing revenue from our agreement with verizon wireless ended in march and the income from the qualcomm agreement is non recurring and will terminate in there can be no assurances that we will be able to enter into similar arrangements in the future 
at december  we had deferred income of million related to the qualcomm agreement 
the following table details the amount of licensing revenue from our agreement with verizon wireless and income from the qualcomm agreement that was recognized or is scheduled to be recognized from to recognized scheduled to be recognized thereafter total in millions income from qualcomm agreement licensing revenue from verizon wireless product cycles 
the cycle for test  evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to more than nine months  with an additional three to more than twelve months before a customer commences 
table of contents volume production of equipment or devices incorporating our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development  selling  general and administrative efforts  and investments in inventory  to the time we generate corresponding revenue  if any 
the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month and quarter to quarter 
if anticipated sales or shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
acquisition strategy 
an element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time or costs required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings  augment our engineering workforce  and enhance our technological capabilities 
since our initial public offering  we have acquired over companies 
from through  we made acquisitions totaling billion in purchase consideration  of which million  million and million related to our broadband communications  mobile wireless and infrastructure networking reportable segments  respectively 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise  including acquisitions and other business combination transactions  strategic relationships  capital infusions and the purchase or sale of assets 
in september we signed a definitive agreement to acquire netlogic microsystems  inc  or netlogic  a publicly traded company that is a leader in high performance intelligent semiconductor solutions for next generation networks 
the expected purchase consideration is approximately billion  net of cash assumed  based on the shares outstanding on september  the transaction has been approved by the broadcom and netlogic boards of directors and is subject to customary closing conditions  including the receipt of clearance by the chinese ministry of commerce under chinese antimonopoly law 
there are no financing contingencies related to the acquisition 
the transaction is expected to close in the first half of the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of our acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these acquisitions 
operating results for the year ended december  in our net income was million as compared to net income of billion in the decrease in profitability was primarily related to lower gross margins and an increase in research and development expenses  as well as the impairment of certain of our purchased intangible assets  our charitable contribution and our restructuring charge 
other highlights during include the following our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion at december   compared with billion at december  we generated cash flow from operations of billion during as compared to billion in in january our board of directors adopted an amendment to the existing dividend policy pursuant to which we increased our quarterly cash dividend by to per share per share on an annual basis and declared a dividend of per share payable to holders of our common stock in each quarter of in february we entered into an accelerated share repurchase  or asr  agreement to repurchase million dollars of our class a common stock  which was recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity 
under the asr program we received and cancelled million shares of our class a common stock with a weighted average price of per share 
in addition to the shares repurchased under the asr in february  we repurchased million shares at a weighted average price of per share 
in april we completed our acquisition of provigent inc  a privately held company that provides highly integrated  high performance  mixed signal semiconductors for microwave backhaul systems 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid million  exclusive of cash assumed  to acquire all of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity rights of provigent 
in may we completed our acquisition of sc square ltd  a leading security software developer for million  exclusive of cash acquired 

table of contents in may the court entered an order granting final approval of a stipulation and agreement of settlement  or derivative settlement related to our federal consolidated shareholder derivative action 
in connection with the derivative settlement  we recorded a million settlement gain in our consolidated statements of income and paid plaintiffs counsel million of the settlement proceeds for attorneys fees  expenses  and costs  which was recorded as an operating expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in september and december we also recorded total net settlement costs of million related to patent infringement claims 
in june we contributed million to the broadcom foundation to support science  technology  engineering and mathematics programs  as well as a broad range of community services which was recorded as an operating expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in june we recorded a purchased intangible impairment charge of million related to our acquisition of beceem communications  inc in the primary factor contributing to this impairment charge was a reduction in the forecasted cash flows related to wimax products  as wireless service providers have accelerated their adoption of long term evolution  or lte  products 
we also recorded other impairment charges of million in in june we completed the internal revenue service irs examination of our income tax returns for to  executed a closing agreement covering the to tax years  and agreed to certain adjustments for the to tax years  primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing transactions 
such adjustments were offset by net operating losses and credits  and did not result in any income tax expense or cash tax liability 
as a result  our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards were reduced by million and million  respectively  which were offset with corresponding reductions in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
as part of our regular product portfolio management review process and in light of our decision to significantly reduce our investment in our digital television and blu ray disc product lines within our broadband communications operating segment  in september we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our worldwide headcount by approximately employees 
we recorded an aggregate of million in net restructuring costs in in november we completed a debt offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due we also amended our credit facility in october to primarily extend the maturity date by two years to november  to date  we have not drawn on this credit facility

factors that may impact net income our net income has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our product mix and volume of product sales and corresponding gross margin see further discussion below under factors that may impact net revenue and factors that may impact product gross margin  required levels of research and development and other operating costs  stock based compensation expense  licensing and income from intellectual property  impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  deferral of revenue and costs under multiple element arrangements  amortization of purchased intangible assets  cash based incentive compensation expense  litigation costs and insurance recoveries  settlement costs or gains  changes in tax laws  adjustments to tax reserves and the results of income tax audits  the loss of interest income resulting from lower average interest rates and investment balance reductions resulting from expenditures on repurchases of our class a common stock  dividends and acquisitions of businesses  charitable contributions  other than temporary impairment of marketable securities  and restructuring costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition  rebates  allowances for doubtful 
table of contents accounts  sales returns and allowances  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  stock based compensation expense  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  strategic investments  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  uncertain tax positions  tax contingencies  self insurance  restructuring costs  litigation and other loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue  costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates  assumptions or judgments net revenue 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
however  we do not recognize revenue when any future performance obligations remain 
customer purchase orders and or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify product delivery 
we assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
in arrangements that include a combination of semiconductor products and other elements  judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units 
we allocate the arrangement consideration based on each element s relative fair value using vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  third party evidence  or estimated selling prices  as the basis of fair value 
revenue is recognized for the accounting units when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met 
a portion of our sales is made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
these pricing credits and or rights of return provisions prevent us from being able to reasonably estimate the final price of the inventory to be sold and the amount of inventory that could be returned pursuant to these agreements 
as a result  the price to the customer is not fixed or determinable at the time we deliver products to our distributors 
accordingly  product revenue from sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers 
in addition  distributors provide us with periodic data regarding product  price  quantity  and customers when products are shipped to their customers  as well as the quantities of our products that they still have in stock 
for specialized shipping terms we may rely on data provided by our freight forwarding providers 
for our licensing revenue we rely on data provided by the licensee 
any error in the data provided to us by customers  distributors or other third parties could lead to inaccurate reporting of our total net revenue and net income 
we defer revenue and income when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and or services have been performed 
deferred revenue does not include amounts from products delivered to distributors that the distributors have not yet sold through to their end customers 
income from the qualcomm agreement 
on april  we entered into a four year settlement and patent license and non assert agreement  or the qualcomm agreement  with qualcomm incorporated  or qualcomm 
the qualcomm agreement is a multiple element arrangement 
we allocated the amount to be received under the qualcomm agreement amongst several elements 
a gain from the settlement of litigation was immediately recognized and approximated the value of awards determined by the united states district court for the central district of california 
the remaining consideration was predominantly associated with the transfer of current and future intellectual property rights  as well as the settlement of all other outstanding litigation  and is being recognized over the four year performance period as a single unit of accounting 

table of contents the value associated with the transfer of intellectual property rights and other elements was treated as a single unit of accounting and  based on the predominant nature of these elements  recognized them within net revenue over the contractual performance period of four years  beginning in and extending through the elements included i an exchange of intellectual property rights  including in certain circumstances  a series of covenants not to assert claims of patent infringement under future patents issued within one to four years of the execution date of the agreement  ii the assignment of certain existing patents by broadcom to qualcomm with broadcom retaining a royalty free license under these patents  and iii the settlement of all outstanding litigation and claims between us and qualcomm 
we consider the qualcomm agreement as predominantly related to the transfer of current and future intellectual property rights 
this conclusion was based on a the amounts specifically awarded by the courts for the patents that were the subject of litigation for which appeals had been substantially exhausted and b the extensive nature of the rights transferred to qualcomm  both for our existing patent portfolio and for the patents we would develop during the next one to four years 
in addition  we obtained a third party valuation of the intellectual property rights 
the inputs and assumptions we used in this valuation were from a market participant perspective and included projected revenue  royalty rates  estimated discount rates  useful lives and income tax rates  among others 
the development of a number of these inputs and assumptions in our model requires a significant amount of management judgment and is based upon a number of factors including the selection of industry comparables  market growth rates and other relevant factors 
changes in any number of these assumptions would have substantially changed the fair value assigned to the intellectual property rights 
these inputs and assumptions represent management s best estimates at the time of the transaction 
sales returns  pricing adjustments and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record reductions of revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as competitive pricing programs and rebates  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
we accrue of potential rebates at the time of sale and do not apply a breakage factor 
we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid 
thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods 
additional reductions of revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any customer were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory write downs and warranty reserves 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory to net realizable value for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs could be required 
under the hubbing arrangements that we maintain with certain customers  we own inventory that is physically located in a customer s or third party s warehouse 
as a result  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  which would cause our total inventory turns to decrease 
in that event  our expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventory could increase and our cash flow could be negatively impacted 
our products typically carry a one to three year warranty 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  product recalls  repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure  as well as possible claims for consequential costs 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
in that event  our product gross margins would be reduced 

table of contents stock based compensation expense 
all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  are recognized in our financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values 
the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
although we utilize the black scholes model  which meets established requirements  the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use the implied volatility for traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
our selection of the implied volatility approach is based on the availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of fair value than historical volatility 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the expected terms of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
prior to  our dividend yield assumption excluded dividend payouts 
in we began to pay quarterly dividends and included that assumption in our fair value calculations 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant less our expected dividend yield 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry  iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results or v the abandonment of any of our acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  projects 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in we early adopted the new provisions issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  that intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
the updated guidance permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting units is less than its carrying amount  we conduct a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values 
we determine the fair values of our reporting units using the income valuation approach  as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
the amount  by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any  is recognized as an impairment loss 
during development  ipr d is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value to its carrying amount 
if the carrying value exceeds its fair value  
table of contents an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
once an ipr d project is complete  it becomes a definite lived intangible asset and is evaluated for impairment in accordance with our policy for long lived assets 
we test long lived assets and purchased intangible assets other than goodwill and ipr d in development for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
we determine whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is recoverable  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows the asset are expected to generate 
if an asset is not recoverable  we record an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we primarily use the income valuation approach to determine the fair value of our long lived assets and purchased intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
it is possible  however  that the plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of our cumulative losses in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  our us tax losses after tax deductions for stock based compensation  and the full utilization of our loss carryback opportunities  we have concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets is appropriate in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
in certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses  we record valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the future  if we realize a deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance  we may record a reduction of income tax expense in the period of such realization 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
litigation and settlement costs 
we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal proceedings 
we prosecute and defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement costs 
in addition  the resolution of intellectual property litigation may require us to pay damages for past alleged infringement or to obtain a license under the other party s intellectual property rights that could require one time license fees or running royalties  which could adversely impact product gross margins in future periods  or could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products or limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may 
table of contents perform for broadcom 
we account for settlement agreements as multiple element arrangements and allocate the consideration to the identifiable elements based on relative fair value 
generally the identifiable elements are the licensing of intellectual property for future use and payments related to alleged prior infringement 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we continually evaluate the uncertainties associated with litigation and record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
however  the outcomes of legal proceedings and or our ability to settle disputes on terms acceptable to us are subject to significant uncertainty 
should we choose to pay significant sums in settling a dispute or should material legal matters be resolved against the company  the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected

the following table presents net revenue from each of our reportable segments and its respective contribution to net revenue year ended december  amount of net revenue amount of net revenue increase decrease change in millions  except percentages broadband communications mobile wireless infrastructure networking all other total net revenue includes i income relating to the qualcomm agreement that was entered into in april and ii other revenue from certain patent agreements 
see discussion above in the overview section and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in net revenue from our broadband communications reportable segment resulted primarily from a decrease in demand for our digital television and blu ray disc product lines and set top boxes  offset in part by an increase in demand for our broadband modems 
as a result  we decided to reduce our investment in our digital television and blu ray disc product lines and reallocate funding to higher return opportunities 
the increase in net revenue from our mobile wireless reportable segment resulted primarily from an increase in demand for our wireless connectivity and cellular solutions 
the increase in net revenue from our infrastructure networking reportable segment resulted primarily from an increase in demand for our ethernet switching and wireless infrastructure products  offset in part by a reduction in demand for our ethernet controller products

see discussion above in the overview section and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in net revenue from our broadband communications reportable segment resulted primarily from a decrease in demand for our digital television and blu ray disc product lines 
the decrease in net revenue from our mobile wireless reportable segment resulted from a decrease in demand for our wireless connectivity solutions 
the decrease in net revenue from our infrastructure networking reportable segment resulted primarily from a decrease in demand for most product lines 
we recorded rebates to certain customers of million  or of net revenue and million  or of net revenue in and  respectively 
the increase in rebates in was attributable to a change in the mix of sales to customers that participate in our rebate programs  primarily an increase in the mobile wireless area 
we 
table of contents anticipate that accrued rebates will vary in future periods based upon the level of overall sales to customers that participate in our rebate programs 
we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end or when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid 
we reversed accrued rebates of million and million in and  respectively 
from time to time  our key customers place large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly 
we expect that these fluctuations will continue and that they may be exaggerated by the seasonal variations in consumer products and changes in the overall economic environment 
additionally  since we own inventory that is physically located in a third party s warehouse  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  causing our total inventory turns to decrease  which could increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete products and negatively impact our cash flow 
for these and other reasons  our total net revenue and results of operations for the year ended december  and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
concentration of net revenue the following table presents details of our product net revenue year ended december  product sales through direct sales force product sales maintained under fulfillment distributor arrangements product sales through distributors sales to our significant customers  including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors  as a percentage of net revenue were as follows year ended december  apple samsung five largest customers as a group less than of net revenue 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total net revenue for the foreseeable future 
the identities of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our total net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
product revenue derived from shipments to international destinations  as a percentage of product revenue was as follows year ended december  china exclusive of hong kong hong kong singapore  taiwan and japan europe other all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 

table of contents factors that may impact net revenue the demand for our products and the subsequent recognition of net revenue has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following general economic and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry  trends in the wired and wireless communications markets in various geographic regions  including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers and distributors  to manage inventory  the timing of our distributors shipments to their customers or when products are taken by our customers under hubbing arrangements  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt ramp our products and technologies  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products  and the availability of credit and financing  which may lead certain of our customers to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us 
cost of product revenue and product gross margin 
cost of product revenue comprises the cost of our semiconductor devices  which consists of the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with our purchase of assembly  test and quality assurance services and packaging materials for semiconductor products  as well as royalties paid to vendors for use of their technology 
also included in cost of product revenue is the amortization of purchased technology and inventory valuation step up  and manufacturing overhead  including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  and stock based compensation expense for personnel engaged in manufacturing support 
product gross margin is product revenue less cost of product revenue divided by product revenue and does not include income from the qualcomm agreement and revenue from the licensing of intellectual property 
total gross margin is total net revenue less cost of product revenue divided by total net revenue 
product gross margin decreased to in as compared to in primarily as a result of i an increase in amortization of purchased intangibles and inventory valuation step up of million primarily due to our acquisitions completed over the last twelve months  and ii a shift in the mix of our product revenues with more revenues attributable to mobile wireless products 
product gross margin decreased to in the three months ended december  from in the three months ended september  primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of our product revenues  offset in part by a decrease in amortization of inventory valuation step up of million 
factors that may impact product and total gross margin our product gross margin has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our product mix and volume of product sales including sales to high volume customers  the positions of our products in their respective life cycles  introduction of products with lower margins  the effects of competition  the effects of competitive pricing programs and rebates  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories and their relationship to demand volatility  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies  fluctuations in direct product costs such as silicon wafer costs and assembly  packaging and testing costs  and other fixed costs  our ability to create cost advantages through successful integration and convergence  
table of contents our ability to advance to the next technology node faster than our competitors  the consolidation of foundry subcontractors that could potentially drive increased wafer prices  licensing royalties payable by us  product warranty costs  fair value and related amortization of acquired tangible and intangible assets  and amortization of acquired inventory valuation step up 
our product and total gross margin may also be impacted by additional stock based compensation expense and changes therein  as discussed below  and the amortization of purchased intangible assets related to future acquisitions 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  including stock based compensation expense 
development and design costs consist primarily of costs related to engineering design tools  mask and prototyping costs  testing and subcontracting costs 
in addition  we incur costs related to facilities and equipment expense  among other items 
the following table presents details of research and development expense year ended december  increase change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in millions  except percentages salaries and benefits stock based compensation development and design costs other research and development the increase in salaries and benefits and stock based compensation were primarily attributable to an increase in headcount of approximately personnel  bringing headcount to approximately  at december   which represents a increase from our december  levels 
development and design costs vary from period to period depending on the timing development and tape out of various products 
the increase in the other line item in the above table is primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation  travel and facilities expenses 
we expect research and development costs to increase as a result of growth in  and the diversification of  the markets we serve  new product opportunities  the number of design wins that go into production  changes in our compensation policies  and any expansion into new markets and technologies 
we remain committed to significant research and development efforts to extend our technology leadership in the wired and wireless communications markets in which we operate 
approximately of our products are currently manufactured in nanometers 
we are designing most new products in nanometers and nanometers  and are beginning to evaluate nanometers 
we currently hold more than  us and more than  foreign patents and more than  additional us and foreign pending patent applications 
we maintain an active program of filing for and acquiring additional us and foreign patents in wired and wireless communications and other fields 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation expense  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses and communications expenses 

table of contents the following table presents details of selling  general and administrative expense year ended december  increase change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in millions  except percentages salaries and benefits stock based compensation legal and accounting fees other selling  general and administrative the increase in salaries and benefits and stock based compensation were primarily attributable to an increase in headcount of approximately personnel  bringing headcount to approximately  at december   which represents an increase from our december  levels 
the increase in legal and accounting fees primarily related to legal fees associated with the federal consolidated shareholder derivative settlement  which included a final million payment to the plaintiffs counsel for attorneys fees  expenses and costs 
legal fees consist primarily of attorneys fees and expenses related to our outstanding intellectual property and prior years securities litigation  patent prosecution and filings and various other transactions 
legal fees fluctuate from period to period due to the nature  scope  timing and costs of the matters in litigation 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the increase in the other line item in the above table is primarily attributable to an increase in travel and facilities expense

the increase in net revenue from our infrastructure networking reportable segment resulted primarily from an increase in demand for our ethernet switching products

cost of product revenue  product gross margin and total gross margin 
product gross margin increased from in to in primarily as a result of cost reductions in each of our reportable segments as we continued our transition to nanometer process technology

our days sales outstanding decreased to days for the three months ended december  as compared to days for the three months ended december  due to our revenue linearity 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard net thirty day payment terms 
if  in the longer term  our revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could also 
table of contents increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers  both of which are more likely to occur during challenging economic times when our customers may have difficulty gaining access to sufficient credit on a timely basis 
our inventory days on hand decreased from days at december  to days at december   primarily attributable to inventory management 
in the future  our inventory levels will continue to be determined by the level of purchase orders we receive and the stage at which our products are in their respective product life cycles  our ability  and the ability of our customers  to manage inventory under hubbing arrangements  and competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels

our financing activities provided billion in cash in  which was primarily the result of million in proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercise of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and million in proceeds from the issuance of our long term debt  offset in part by million in repurchases of shares of our class a common stock  dividends paid of million  repayment of debt assumed in our teknovus acquisition of million  and million in minimum tax withholding paid on behalf of employees for shares issued pursuant to restricted stock units 
the timing and number of stock option exercises and employee stock purchases and the amount of cash proceeds we receive through those exercises and purchases are not within our control  and in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past 
moreover  it is now our general practice to issue a combination of time based and performance based rsus only to certain employees and  in most cases to issue solely time based rsus 
while we may issue stock options in the future  we currently plan to do so only in connection with acquisitions 
unlike the exercise of stock options  the issuance of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units does not result in any cash proceeds to broadcom and requires the use of cash  as we currently allow employees to elect to have a portion of the shares issued upon vesting of restricted stock units withheld to satisfy minimum statutory withholding taxes  which we then pay in cash to the appropriate tax authorities on each participating employee s behalf 
short and long term financing arrangements at december   we had the following resources available to obtain short term or long term financings if we need additional liquidity registration statements we have a form s universal shelf registration statement and a form s acquisition shelf registration statement on file with the sec 
the universal shelf registration statement on form s permits broadcom to sell  in one or more public offerings  shares of our class a common stock  shares of preferred stock or debt securities  or any

the notes with an aggregate principal amount of million that we issued in november more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements were issued pursuant to the form s the form s will expire in accordance with applicable sec rules on february  the acquisition shelf registration statement on form s enables us to issue up to million shares of our class a common stock in one or more acquisition transactions 
these transactions may include the acquisition of assets  businesses or securities by any form of business combination 
to date no securities have been issued pursuant to the s registration statement  which does not have an expiration date mandated by sec rules 
credit facility in november we entered into a credit facility with certain institutional lenders that provides for unsecured revolving facility loans  swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to million 
we amended this credit facility in october primarily to extend the maturity date by two years to november   at which time all outstanding revolving facility loans if any and accrued and unpaid interest must be repaid 
the amendment to the credit facility also decreased the interest rate margins applicable to loans made under the credit facility and the commitment fee paid on the amount of the unused commitments 
we did not draw on our credit facility in or the credit facility contains customary representations  warranties and covenants 
financial covenants require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than to and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of no less than to

these notes consist of million aggregate principal amount which mature in november  or the notes  and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and million aggregate principal amount which mature in november  or the notes  and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
proceeds from the issuance of the notes and the notes were utilized for general corporate purposes 
in november we issued senior unsecured notes in aggregate principal amount of million which mature in november and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  or the notes 
proceeds from the notes are expected to fund a portion of the acquisition consideration for netlogic 
the notes are subject to a mandatory redemption in the event broadcom s proposed acquisition of netlogic is not consummated on or prior to august   or if prior to august   the agreement and plan of merger is terminated 
in such an event  the notes will be redeemed for cash at a price equal to of the aggregate principle amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes contain a number of restrictive covenants  including  but not limited to  restrictions on our ability to grant liens on assets  enter into sale and lease back transactions  or merge  consolidate or sell assets 
failure to comply with these covenants  or any other event of default  could result in acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes

our leased facilities comprise an aggregate of million square feet 
our principal facilities in irvine have lease terms that expire at various dates through with an aggregate rent of million included in the table above 
inventory and related purchase obligations represent purchase commitments for silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
we depend upon third party subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order these materials and services from subcontractors well in advance 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the ensuing six months 
our subcontractor relationships typically allow for the cancellation of outstanding purchase orders  but require payment of all expenses incurred through the date of cancellation 
to date we have not incurred significant cancellation charges 
other obligations represent purchase commitments for lab test equipment  computer hardware  information systems infrastructure  mask and prototyping costs  intellectual property licensing arrangements and other commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
for purposes of the table above  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within a relatively short time horizon 
we have additional purchase orders not included in the table above that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventories or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
unrecognized tax benefits were million  of which million would result in potential cash payment of taxes and million would result in a reduction in net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we are not including any amount related to uncertain tax positions in the table presented above because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits  we have also recorded a liability for potential tax penalties and interest of million and million  respectively  at december  prospective capital needs we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated from operations and from the issuance of common stock through our employee stock option and purchase plans  will be 
table of contents sufficient to cover our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  commitments  repurchases of our class a common stock and quarterly dividends for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may choose to raise additional funds or draw on our existing credit facility to finance our activities beyond the next months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies  including our pending acquisition of netlogic 
if needed  we may be able to raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
we could also reduce certain expenditures  such as repurchases of our class a common stock 
we expect our acquisition of netlogic for per share  or approximately billion  net of cash assumed  to close in the first half of we currently expect to fund the acquisition with our available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us  which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
for at least the next months  we have sufficient cash in the us and expect domestic cash flow to sustain our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities  such as acquisitions  quarterly dividends  share buy backs and repayment of debt 
in addition  we expect existing foreign cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities  such as material capital expenditures  for at least the next months 
if we require more capital in the us than is generated by our domestic operations  any taxable income that could result from the repatriation of our foreign earnings would be offset by our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards  which are currently subject to a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  and would not be expected to have a material effect on our tax liabilities 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or utilize or increase our existing credit facilities for other reasons 
however  we may not be able to obtain additional funds on a timely basis at acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a common stock 
as of december  we have approximately billion of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries 
as a result of the june  closing of our irs audit and agreed adjustments to income for the through tax years  million was paid from our foreign subsidiaries to broadcom corporation during the three months ended september  this amount was not subject to additional income tax 
the income resulting from the irs adjustments was offset by net operating loss carryforwards 
any potential additional income  which could result if we were to repatriate the remaining billion of foreign cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would be offset by existing net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards and should not have a material effect on our tax liabilities 
our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards are currently subject to a full valuation allowance 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including general economic and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry  trends in the wired and wireless communications markets in various geographic regions  including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated  acquisitions of businesses  assets  products or technologies  the unavailability of credit and financing  which may lead certain of our customers to reduce their levels of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us  litigation expenses  settlements and judgments  the overall levels of sales of our semiconductor products  licensing revenue  income from the qualcomm agreement and product gross margins

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we manage our total portfolio to encompass a diversified pool of investment grade securities to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
the average credit rating of our marketable securities portfolio by major credit rating agencies was aa aa 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income  net  may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded fixed income investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any fixed income securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in the income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
in the current interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  the current interest rate environment may continue to negatively impact our investment income 
to assess the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of december   a similar basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

table of contents actual future gains and losses associated with our investments may differ from the sensitivity analyses performed as of december  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and level of interest rates and our actual exposures and positions 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would not have a material impact on our revolving credit facility  which bears a floating interest rate 
this sensitivity analysis assumes all other variables will remain constant in future periods 
our senior notes bear fixed interest rates  and therefore  would not be subject to interest rate risk 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our business in the future 
other risks we believe we do not have material direct or indirect exposure to european sovereign or non sovereign debt
