item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies for more information 
the table below presents the percentages of our total gross sales  net revenue and gross trade accounts receivable attributed to each of these three wholesale drug distributors as of and for the years ended december   and gross sales net revenue gross accounts receivable gross sales net revenue gross accounts receivable gross sales net revenue gross accounts receivable amerisourcebergen cardinal mckesson combined total amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson are key distributors of our products  as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies 
none of these distributors is an end user of our products 
if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease  we believe that the end users of our products would find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor 
however  the loss of one or more of these distributors  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we consider our business relationships with these three wholesalers to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with each of them 
a change in purchasing patterns  a decrease in inventory levels  an increase in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item a risk factors we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect for more information 
backorders 
as of december   we had approximately million of products on backorder as compared to approximately million of backorders as of december  we anticipate filling all current open backorders during government regulation 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies  including the fda  the drug enforcement administration dea  the federal trade commission ftc and other federal  state and local agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act  the controlled substance act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development  testing  manufacture  labeling  storage and promotion of products that we manufacture and market 
the fda inspects drug manufacturers and storage facilities to determine compliance with its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations  non compliance with which can result in fines  recall and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal to approve ndas and andas and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to revoke approval of drug products 
fda approval is required before any application drug product can be manufactured and marketed 
new drugs require the application filing of an nda  including clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug 
generic drugs  which are equivalents of existing  off patent brand name drugs  require the application filing of an anda 
an anda does not  for the most part  require clinical studies since safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated by the product originator 
however  the anda must  for example  provide data demonstrating the equivalency of the generic formulation in terms of bioavailability 
the time required by the fda to review and approve ndas and andas is variable and  to a large extent  beyond our control 
we are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and the dea 
throughout the five year period ended december   there have been no product interruptions associated with regulatory inspection or review activities 
the most recent inspections conducted during june at our somerset  new jersey plant and august at our decatur  illinois plant  resulted in no significant observations 
product recalls 
there were no recalls of any of our products during  or during  we recorded a net provision for product recalls of  in relation to a recall of our cyanide antidote kits during this recall was initiated when we were notified by the manufacturer of a syringe contained within the kit that the syringe was being recalled 
the recall of our cyanide antidote kits resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply in the marketplace 
dea regulation 
we also manufacture and distribute several controlled drug substances  the distribution and handling of which are regulated by the dea 
failure to comply with dea regulations can result in fines or seizure of product 
there were no dea citations issued to us in  or environment 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect from compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
foreign sales 
during  and  approximately million  million and million of our net revenue  respectively  was related to sales to customers in foreign countries 
the increase in over the prior two years was due to a large order for one injectable akorn product  and international sales of theratears products following our acquisition of avr in early may our foreign sales are expected to increase as a result of the kilitch acquisition 
seasonality and other cyclical sales fluctuations 
most of our business segments do not experience significant seasonality 
we do market certain allergy products that typically generate higher sales volume in the warmer months  but these products do not materially impact our overall sales trends 
additionally  we market various antidote products through our hospital drugs injectables segment  the sales of which are largely timed to the expiration of existing stock held by our ongoing customers 
the products we previously marketed through our biologics vaccines segment were subject to seasonal fluctuations  with td vaccines sold in the spring through fall seasons and flu vaccine products typically sold in the august through november period 
we discontinued distribution of flu vaccines during and ceased distribution of td vaccines as of march  upon the termination of our mbl distribution agreement 
government contracts 
none of our business segments is generally subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government

risk factors 
we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect 
a small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a significant portion of our gross sales  net revenues and accounts receivable 
the following three wholesalers amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson accounted for approximately of total gross sales and of total net revenues in  and of gross trade receivables as of december  in addition to acting as distributors of our products  these three companies also distribute a broad range of health care products on behalf of many other companies 
the loss of our relationship with one or more of these wholesalers  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations 
a change in purchasing patterns or inventory levels  an increase in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue  results of operations and cash flows 
our growth depends on our ability to timely develop additional pharmaceutical products and manufacturing capabilities 
our strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distributions channels and  when appropriate  the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels 
we may fail to meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of andas and ndas or may decide not to pursue andas or ndas that we have submitted or anticipate submitting 
our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that we or our strategic business alliances will successfully develop new pharmaceutical products or  if developed  successfully integrate new products into our existing product lines 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive all necessary fda approvals or that such approvals will not involve delays  which adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products 
our failure to develop new products  to maintain substantial compliance with fda compliance guidelines or to receive fda approval of andas or ndas  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulations that increase our costs and could subject us to fines  prevent us from selling our products or prevent us from operating our facilities 
federal and state government agencies regulate virtually all aspects of our business 
the development  testing  manufacturing  processing  quality  safety  efficacy  packaging  labeling  record keeping  distribution  storage and advertising of our products  and disposal of waste products arising from such activities  are subject to regulation by the fda  dea  ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency 
similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities 
noncompliance with applicable united states and or state or local regulatory requirements can result in fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  suspensions of production  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new  modified and additional regulations  statutes or legal interpretation  if any  could  among other things  require changes to manufacturing methods  expanded or different labeling  the recall  replacement or discontinuation of certain products  additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation 
such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business government regulation 
we are subject to regulation by the fda 
all pharmaceutical manufacturers  including us  are subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the fdc act 
under the fdc act  the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement authority over the activities of finished drug product manufacturers to ensure compliance with fda regulations 
this authority includes  but is not limited to  the authority to initiate court action to seize unapproved or non complying products  to enjoin non complying activities  to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cgmp  to recall products  to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute violators 
other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications or the withdrawal of previously approved applications 
any such enforcement activities  including the restriction or prohibition on sales of products we market or the halting of our manufacturing operations  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  product recalls may be issued at our discretion  or at the request of the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical products 
recalls may occur due to disputed labeling claims  manufacturing issues  quality defects or other reasons 
no assurance can be given that restriction or prohibition on sales  halting of manufacturing operations or recalls of our pharmaceutical products will not occur in the future 
any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  such actions  in certain circumstances  could constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing relationships 
we must obtain approval from the fda for each pharmaceutical product that we market which requires a regulatory submission 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy  and approval is never certain 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product  may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute a product or may require post marketing studies or impose other post marketing obligations 
we and our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the fda to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing  distribution  and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
the fda imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy 
the fda also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs 
a finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with fda requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the fda changes its regulatory position  it could force us to delay or suspend our manufacturing  distribution or sales of certain products 
fda interpretations of existing or pending regulations and standards may change over time with the advancement of associated technologies  industry trends  and or prevailing scientific rationale 
if the fda changes its regulatory position due to such factors  it could result in our delay or suspension of the manufacturing  distribution or sales of certain of our products 
we believe that all of our current products are in substantial compliance with fda regulations and have received the requisite agency approvals for their manufacture and sale 
in addition  modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process 
any change in the fda s enforcement policy or any decision by the fda to require an approved nda or anda for one of our products not currently subject to the approved nda or anda requirements or any delay in the fda approving an nda or anda for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a limited number of products we market are non application drugs that are manufactured and marketed without fda issued andas or ndas on the basis of their having been marketed by industry prior to the amendment of the fdc act 
these products have routinely been disclosed to fda by akorn 
the regulatory status of these products is subject to change and or challenge by the fda  which could establish new standards and limitations for manufacturing and marketing of such products  or challenge the evidence of prior manufacturing and marketing upon which grandfathering status is based 
any such change in the status of such product could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive dea regulation  which could result in our being fined or otherwise penalized 
we also manufacture and sell drugs which are controlled substances as defined in the federal controlled substances act and similar state laws  which impose  among other things  certain licensing  security and record keeping requirements administered by the dea and similar state agencies  as well as quotas for the manufacture  purchase and sale of controlled substances 
the dea could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which we are permitted to manufacture and market 
see item business dea regulation 
we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and may face difficulties in integrating them  which could adversely affect our operating results  increase costs and place a significant strain on our management 
if we fail to manage the integration of our domestic and international acquisitions and achieve expected synergies  our business could be disrupted and our operating results could be negatively impacted 
the operating success of both our domestic and international acquisitions involves the integration of products  processes and personnel into our existing model 
in addition  the integration of international acquisitions requires both establishing and training a local management team and overseeing the operations remotely  and can involve cultural  monetary and systems challenges 
our personnel  systems  procedures  or controls may not be adequate to support both our ongoing business and the acquired businesses 
if our newly acquired businesses require a disproportionate share of our resources and management s attention  our overall financial results may suffer 
we may not generate cash flow sufficient to pay interest on our outstanding convertible senior notes or repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change 
in june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes 
the notes require us to make semi annual coupon interest payments of million on june and december of each year until the notes mature on june  if we do not generate sufficient operating cash flows to fund these payments or obtain additional funding from external sources at acceptable terms  we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our interest payment obligations when those obligations are due 
if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture occurs  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes 
if we fail to repurchase the notes when required  we will be in default under the indenture that governs the notes 
we may need to obtain additional capital to continue to grow our business 
it is possible that we will require additional funds in order to materially grow our business 
we require substantial liquidity to implement long term cost savings and productivity improvement plans  continue capital spending to improve our manufacturing plants to increase capacity and support product development programs  meet scheduled term debt and lease maturities  and run our normal business operations 
we may seek additional funds through public and private financing  including equity and debt offerings 
however  adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available to us when needed or on terms favorable to us 
without sufficient additional capital funding  we may be required to delay  scale back or abandon some or all of our product development  manufacturing  acquisition  licensing and marketing initiatives  or operations 
further  such additional financing  if obtained  may require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of the common stockholders and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest 
we have entered into several strategic business alliances that may not result in marketable products 
we have entered into several strategic business alliances that have been formed to supply us with low cost finished dosage form products 
since  we have entered into various purchase and supply agreements and license agreements that are all designed to provide finished dosage form products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will result in additional fda approved andas or ndas  or that we will be able to market any such additional products at a profit 
in addition  any clinical trial expenses that we incur may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 
availability under our credit agreement may be restricted if we fail to meet our covenant requirements 
we are party to a revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na  the agent and other financial institutions collectively with the agent  the boa lenders through which we obtained a million revolving line of credit the boa credit facility  which includes a million letter of credit facility 
we may request expansion of the boa credit facility from time to time in increments of at least million up to a maximum commitment of million  so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 
the facility matures in march we may early terminate the boa lenders commitments under the boa credit facility upon days notice to the agent at any time after the first year 
availability under the revolving credit line is equal to the lesser of a million reduced by outstanding letter of credit obligations or b the amount of a borrowing base as defined in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement determined by reference to the value of the borrowers eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and fixed assets as of the closing date and the end of each calendar month thereafter 
the boa credit agreement contains representations and warranties  and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type  including  but not limited to  limitations on distributions  additional borrowings and liens  additional investments and asset sales  and fundamental changes to corporate structure or organization documents 
the financial covenants require the borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to during any period commencing on the date that an event of default occurs or availability under the boa credit agreement is less than of the aggregate boa lenders commitments under the boa credit agreement 
during the term of the agreement  we must provide the agent with monthly  quarterly and annual financial statements  monthly compliance certificates  annual budget projections and copies of press releases and sec filings 
should we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants  availability under the credit agreement could be restricted which would negatively impact our liquidity and may require us to seek additional sources of capital in order to maintain our continuing operations or to fund growth opportunities 
our growth and profitability is dependent on our ability to successfully utilize our existing cash reserves and operating cash flows to complete strategic acquisitions or to identify  acquire or develop  new product to market and distribute 
we continue to seek growth opportunities  either by completing strategic acquisitions or by developing and introducing new pharmaceutical products 
continued improvement in our financial performance is dependent on our ability to introduce new products on an ongoing basis  whether developed internally or by third party partners  or acquired from other companies 
any delays or an inability to successfully identify suitable acquisition targets  or acquire or develop  and market and distribute new products may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 
our success depends on the development of generic and off patent pharmaceutical products  which are particularly susceptible to competition  substitution policies and reimbursement policies 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to identify suitable branded pharmaceutical products to target for development of generic equivalents  determine or anticipate the dates when these branded pharmaceuticals are expected to come off patent  and time our product development activities accordingly so that we will be ready to manufacture and market our generic equivalent products at the most advantageous times 
generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals  even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices that are significantly lower than branded pharmaceuticals 
generic substitution is regulated by the federal and state governments  as is reimbursement for generic drug dispensing 
there can be no assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic drugs or that such products will be subject to government reimbursement 
in addition  generic products developed by other third parties may render our generic products noncompetitive or obsolete  or may glut the market with competing products resulting in a reduction in sale price or market share for the generic products we sell 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to consistently bring generic pharmaceutical products to market quickly and efficiently in the future 
an increase in competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or our failure to bring such products to market before our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products that either we or other pharmaceutical companies sell 
in addition  governmental and cost containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in generic substitution and competition generally for our branded pharmaceutical products 
we attempt to mitigate the effect of this substitution through  among other things  creation of strong brand name recognition and product line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
we can be subject to legal proceedings against us  which may prove costly and time consuming even if without merit 
in the ordinary course of our business  we can be involved in legal actions with both private parties and certain government agencies 
to the extent that our personnel may have to spend time and resources to pursue or contest any matters that may be asserted from time to time in the future  this represents time and money that is not available for other actions that we might otherwise pursue which could be beneficial to our future 
in addition  to the extent that we are unsuccessful in any legal proceedings  the consequences could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
our revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties  which we cannot control 
we rely on external third parties to manufacture certain of the products we sell 
currently  this risk is limited to a few akorn and avr products 
however  we expect this risk to become more significant as we receive approvals for new products to be manufactured through our strategic partnerships and as we seek additional growth opportunities beyond the capacity and capabilities of our two domestic manufacturing facilities 
if we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers for these products on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to distribute such products as planned 
further  no assurance can be given that the manufacturers we use will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of our products to meet our needs or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications 
any delays or difficulties with third party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the chairman of our board of directors is subject to conflicts of interest  and through his stock ownership and position as chairman has substantial influence over our business strategies and policies 
john n 
kapoor  phd  the chairman of our board of directors and a principal shareholder  is the president of ej financial enterprises  inc ej financial  a health care consulting investment company 
ej financial is involved in the management of health care companies in various fields  and dr 
kapoor is involved in various capacities with the management and operation of these companies 
the john n 
kapoor trust dated the kapoor trust  the beneficiary and sole trustee of which is dr 
kapoor  is a principal shareholder of each of these companies 
as a result  dr 
kapoor does not devote his full time to our business 
although such companies do not currently compete directly with us  certain companies with which ej financial is involved are in the pharmaceutical business 
discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete 
potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dr 
kapoor owns  directly and indirectly  a substantial portion of our outstanding voting common stock 
as a result  dr 
kapoor can strongly influence  and potentially control  the outcome of our corporate actions  including the election of our directors and transactions involving a change of control 
decisions made by dr 
kapoor with respect to his and his related parties ownership or trading of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and an adverse effect on our business 
we depend on key executive officers and must continue to attract and retain key personnel in order to compete successfully 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain key executive officers 
the loss of one or more of our key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  our performance depends  to a large extent  on the continued service of our key research and development personnel  other technical employees  managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical personnel 
we are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future  and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  and on our results of operations and financial condition 
the fda may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a non prescription basis  which would reduce the profitability of our prescription products 
from time to time  the fda elects to permit sales of some pharmaceuticals currently sold on a prescription basis  without a prescription 
fda approval of the sale of our products without a prescription would reduce demand for our competing prescription products and  accordingly  reduce our profits 
our industry is very competitive 
additionally  changes in technology could render our products obsolete 
we face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies  including major pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than ours  in developing  acquiring  manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
the selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases 
further  other products now in use  under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies  may be more effective or offered at lower prices than our current or future products 
the industry is characterized by rapid technological change that may render our products obsolete  and competitors may develop their products more rapidly than we can 
competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner  and therefore  may begin to market their products in advance of ours 
we believe that competition in sales of our products is based primarily on price  service and technical capabilities 
there can be no assurance that i we will be able to develop or acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products  ii additional competitors will not enter the market  iii our existing products will not be rendered obsolete by the introduction or switch to generic of competing products  or iv competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business 
our general business strategy may be adversely affected by general economic conditions  a volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions 
if equity and credit market conditions prove unfavorable  we may have difficulty obtaining desired debt or equity financing  or obtaining such financing may be more difficult  more costly  and more dilutive 
a prolonged or profound economic downturn could result in adverse changes to product reimbursement  pricing or sales levels  which would harm our operating results 
there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers  manufacturers and other partners may not survive difficult economic times  which would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget 
failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy  financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon development plans 
there is also a possibility that our stock price may decline  due in part to the volatility of the stock market and general economic conditions 
we may implement product recalls and could be exposed to significant product liability claims  we may have to pay significant amounts to those harmed and may suffer from adverse publicity as a result 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk that our products  or items within our products  may prove to be defective and cause a health risk 
in that event  we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority 
we have recalled products in the past and  based on this experience  believe that the occurrence of a recall could result in significant costs to us  potential disruptions in the supply of our products to our customers and adverse publicity  all of which could harm our ability to market our products 
we were prompted to initiate one product recall of our cyanide antidote kit during  due to the third quarter recall notification by bd  of their ml syringe 
this syringe is included as part of a packaged kit along with drug components manufactured and sourced by us  to support the cyanide antidote kit 
our recall of the cyanide antidote kit was necessitated by the bd recall  and has resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply to the marketplace 
our supporting efforts were reviewed by the fda  as part of our due diligence in apprising the fda of our reaction to the bd recall 
there were no product recalls in  or although we are not currently subject to any material product liability proceedings  we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future 
even meritless claims could subject us to adverse publicity  hinder us from securing insurance coverage in the future and require us to incur significant legal fees and divert the attention of the key employees from running our business 
successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of  for aggregate annual claims with a  deductible per incident and a  aggregate annual deductible 
however  there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to fully cover potential claims 
additionally  there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source 
we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted 
many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source and interruptions in the supply of these raw materials and components could disrupt our manufacturing of specific products and cause our sales and profitability to decline 
further  in the case of many of our andas and ndas  only one supplier of raw materials has been identified 
because fda approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications  fda approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier 
the qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products  we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and processes 
the patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions  and is the subject of much litigation 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights  including licensed rights  relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured  or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights  if any  will provide protection against competitors who i successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights  ii obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business  or iii are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position 
it is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us  which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed there from 
consequently  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or rendering obsolete those that we are planning to develop  or duplicate any of our products 
our inability to obtain patents for  or other proprietary rights in  our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  virtually all the drug products that we market are generics  with essentially no patent or proprietary rights attached 
while this fact allowed us the opportunity to develop or to purchase and obtain fda approval to market our generic products  it also allows competing drug companies to do the same 
should multiple additional drug companies choose to develop and market the same generic products that we actively market  our profit margins could decline  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentrated ownership of our common stock and our registration of shares for public sale creates a risk of sudden changes in our share price 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have registered shares held by certain of our investors for sale under registration statements filed with the sec 
sales of these shares on the open market could cause the price of our stock to decline 
exercise of warrants and options  or issuance of shares pursuant to our convertible debt  may have a substantial dilutive effect on our common stock 
if the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise or conversion of any warrants or stock options is in excess of the various exercise or conversion prices of such convertible securities  exercise or conversion of such convertible securities would have a dilutive effect on our common stock 
as of december   holders of our outstanding warrants and options would receive  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
any additional financing that we secure likely will require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock which may result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders 
our earnings will be diluted if the average closing price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price currently per share on our convertible notes 
in addition  the notes become convertible if the closing trading price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for of the last trading days of any calendar quarter through the remaining term of the notes 
if the notes become convertible and are surrendered for conversion  we have the option of satisfying all or a portion of our obligation in shares of our common stock  which could result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders 
we may issue preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to a total of  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
our board of directors may determine whether to issue additional shares of preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock

financing initiatives effective june   we closed on a million offering of convertible senior notes due  providing us with capital to pursue a number of growth initiatives 
subsequent to closing this offering  on october  we entered into a loan and security agreement with bank of america  na to establish a million revolving credit facility to supplement our convertible debt financing

internal growth our revenue grew by  from million in to million in while a significant portion of this increase was related to acquisitions  we also saw a sizeable increase in our continuing business 
this increase was due to a combination of increased sales volumes and selected price increases for a number of products  and re launches of a number of products that had been dormant 
to pave the way for future revenue growth  we continue to invest in our r d efforts  evidenced by the new anda applications we filed with the fda during results of operations for the years  and  we have identified and reported operating results for four distinct business segments ophthalmic  hospital drugs injectables  contract services  and biologics vaccines

the increases in two of our core segments ophthalmic and hospital drugs injectables offset a decline of million in contract services revenue and a decline of million in biologics vaccines revenue 
the decrease in contract services revenue was due to refocusing our manufacturing plants on producing akorn labeled products  along with the loss of avr as a contract customer upon our acquisition of this business in may the decrease in biologics vaccines revenue was due to our strategic decision to exit this segment in march our revenues of million was net of adjustments totaling million for chargebacks  rebates  administration fees  returns  discounts and allowances  and coupons and advertising 
chargeback and rebate expense for was million or of gross revenue  compared to expense of million  or of gross revenue 
the million increase in chargeback expense was due to higher gross sales volume in as a percentage of gross sales  the decrease in chargeback and rebate expenses is attributable to the avr business  which is subject to minimal chargebacks 
our products returns provision was million in compared to million in this million increase was due to higher sales volume in our consolidated gross profit for was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in this gross profit increase of million  or  was due to several factors  including revenue growth from our introduction of new products carrying higher profit margins  increased sales and selected price increases for existing products  improved plant utilization  and improved inventory management 
the gross profit margin on ophthalmic segment sales increased to in compared to in  and the gross profit margin on hospital drugs injectables increased to in compared to in the prior year 
these increases were primarily due to improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities  as well as a number of lesser factors  such as selected price increases for certain products 
the gross profit margin on contract services increased to in compared to in the prior year  this increase being primarily attributable to improved plant utilization  price increases for certain products  and the elimination of lower margin contract revenue from avr upon our acquisition of that business 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to sg a expenses for avr  increases in wages and salaries for additional headcount to support our growth  and increases in non cash stock compensation expense and management bonuses in accordance with our improved financial performance 
research and development r d expenses were million in compared to million in this increase of million was the result of our commitment to enhancing our internal r d infrastructure  increased r d activity at our dedicated facility in skokie  illinois  and the establishment of a million reserve against inventory of products pending fda approval 
amortization of intangibles consists of the amortization of nda and anda drug acquisition costs over the anticipated market lives of the acquired products  as well as the amortization of other intangible assets acquired through business combinations

write off and amortization of deferred financing costs totaled million in compared to million in in each year  the majority of the expense was related to write offs 
in june  we elected to early terminate our ej credit facility and wrote off million in remaining unamortized deferred financing costs

we are a partner in the joint venture company  which we account for using the equity method 
during  we recorded million of equity in income from this unconsolidated joint venture  compared to million in the prior year 
of the million income in  million was related to our share of the gain from the joint venture company s sale of its andas to pfizer on december   and the remaining million was from the joint venture company s operations 
of the million income in  million was related to our share of the gain 
the joint venture company entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell the rights to all of its andas to pfizer for million in cash 
the asset purchase agreement contained two closing dates  with some andas having been transferred on the initial close date of december  and the rest transferred on the final closing date of may  the gains from this sale were allocated between the two closing dates based on the relative fair value of the andas transferred to pfizer on each date 
the joint venture company essentially ceased operations in the second quarter of during  we incurred non cash expenses of million related to the change in fair value of warrants we granted at various dates in to companies controlled by our chairman  dr 
john kapoor the kapoor warrants 
we classified the kapoor warrants as current liabilities from their grant dates until june   and adjusted their book values quarterly to reflect changes in their fair values 
as a result of an amendment entered into on june  to the registration rights agreement associated with these warrants  we reclassified the kapoor warrants from current liabilities to a component of shareholders equity on june  and made no subsequent fair value adjustments beyond that date 
accordingly  there was no similar expense recorded in in  we recorded a non operating expense of million related to an option agreement we entered into to protect ourselves from a negative movement in the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and indian rupees 
we entered into this option agreement in october following our entry into an agreement to buy certain assets from kilitch in india  as the purchase price for the kilitch acquisition was established in indian rupees 
we incurred no similar expenses in comparison of twelve months ended december  and our revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to this increase in revenue was related to a number of factors  including the introduction of new products  such as erythromycin ophthalmic ointment and hydromorphone hydrochloride  price increases for certain products  and increases in contract manufacturing for the joint venture company and unrelated third party companies

the million increase in chargeback expense was due to higher gross sales volume in as well as an increase in the percentage of our sales that were through group purchasing organization gpo contracts and thereby subject to chargeback adjustments 
this second factor  along with a shift in segment mix due to our exit from the biologics vaccines segment  were the primary reasons that chargeback and rebate expenses increased as a percentage of gross sales in our products returns provision was million in compared to million in this million decrease was due to improved inventory management practices and a related reduction of inventory days of our product at the major wholesalers  which resulted in lower actual product returns and a reduction to potential future returns 
our consolidated gross profit for was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in this gross profit increase of million  or  was due to several factors  including our introduction of new products in carrying higher profit margins  improved plant utilization and stable wholesaler inventory levels during compared to a strategic decrease of wholesaler inventory levels in the gross profit margin on ophthalmic segment sales increased to in compared to in  and the gross profit margin on hospital drugs injectables increased to in compared to in the prior year

the gross profit margin on contract services increased to in compared to in the prior year  this increase being primarily attributable to improved plant utilization and price increases for certain products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  from the prior year 
this small decrease in sg a expenses  despite the increase in sales volume  was primarily the result of significant cost reductions where we reduced personnel and travel costs  and also negotiated lower fees and operating costs with key service providers toward the end of and early this was partially offset by increased management bonus and stock option expense in accordance with our improved financial performance in research and development r d expenses were million in compared to million in this increase of million was the result of a renewed focus on enhancing our internal r d infrastructure in  as we opened a new r d center in skokie  illinois early in february and hired additional scientists to staff it

we were unable to make scheduled payments to mbl in february and march  and negotiated a settlement agreement with mbl that changed our agreement from an exclusive to a non exclusive agreement and also eliminated the future minimum purchase commitments contained in the original agreement

the modification agreement also granted ej funds the right to require us to nominate two directors to serve on our board of directors 
the kapoor trust is entitled to require us to nominate a third director under our stock purchase agreement dated november  with the kapoor trust 
pursuant to the modification agreement  on april   we granted ej funds a warrant the modification warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the modification warrant expires five years after its issuance and is exercisable upon payment of the exercise price in cash or by means of a cashless exercise yielding a net share figure 
on august   we completed negotiations with ej funds for additional capacity on our credit facility  increasing the loan commitment from million to million 
in consideration of this amendment  ej funds was granted a warrant to acquire  shares of our common stock at per share  the closing market price on august  the restatement warrants 
the estimated fair value of the restatement warrants  using a black scholes valuation model  was million on the date of grant 
the credit facility was secured by our assets and per the terms of this amendment was not subject to debt covenants until april  on january   the parties entered into an amendment to the ge ej credit agreement which  among other things  reduced the number of financial covenants to two a limit on capital expenditures of million in  million in  and million in and a requirement to have positive liquidity throughout the life of the ge ej credit agreement 
subsequently  on january   ej funds and the company signed a waiver and consent that waived our obligation to comply with the capital expenditure limit for on june   we elected to early terminate our million revolving ge ej credit agreement with ej funds 
we had not borrowed against the ge ej credit agreement since repaying its outstanding balance in the first quarter of upon terminating the ge ej credit agreement  we expensed million in remaining unamortized deferred financing costs related to the ge ej credit agreement 
we incurred no fees or penalties related to the early termination of the ge ej credit agreement 
subordinated note payable on july   we borrowed million from the kapoor trust dated september   the sole trustee and sole beneficiary of which is dr 
john n 
kapoor  the chairman of our board of directors and the holder of a significant stock position in the company  in return for issuing the trust a subordinated note the subordinated note 
the subordinated note accrued interest at a rate of per year and was due and payable on july  on august   the subordinated note was refinanced  with the principal amount increased to million to include interest accrued through august   and the term of the subordinated note extended by an additional five years to august  the interest rate remained unchanged at per year  and interest on the refinanced note was payable monthly 
as part of this refinancing agreement  we issued to the kapoor trust an additional  warrants the subordinated note warrants to purchase our common stock at an exercise price of  the closing price of the our stock on august  the fair value of these warrants on august   as calculated using a black scholes valuation model  was million 
this amount  along with  in legal fees  was capitalized as deferred financing costs and was being amortized over the term of the subordinated debt 
on december   we voluntarily prepaid the principal of the subordinated note  along with a early payment fee and all accrued interest 
our total cash payment on december   including principal  accrued interest  and the early payment fee  was million 
upon completing this early payment we expensed the remaining million unamortized balance of the million in deferred financing costs incurred when we refinanced the subordinated note 
preferred stock and warrants pipe warrants on march   we issued  shares of our common stock in a private placement with various investors at a price of per share which included warrants to purchase  additional shares of common stock 
the warrants were exercisable for a five year period ended march  at an exercise price of per share and may be exercised by cash payment of the exercise price or by means of a cashless exercise 
holders submitted  warrants for cashless exercise during  leaving  remaining outstanding as of december  subsequently  during the period from january  through march   holders submitted  of the warrants for exercise 
the remaining  warrants expired unexercised on march  kapoor warrants during  in connection with modifications to our subordinated note  credit agreement and mbl distribution agreement  we granted various warrants to acquire our common stock the kapoor warrants to ej funds and the kapoor trust  companies controlled by the chairman of our board of directors  dr 
john n 
kapoor 
each of the kapoor warrants will expire five years after its grant date  if not exercised 
the fair value of each of the kapoor warrants was calculated at their grant dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
from their grant dates until june   the kapoor warrants were classified as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in their calculated fair values 
increases in fair value  or decreases in fair value to  but not below  their initial calculated fair values  were recorded as non operating expenses or income in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the applicable periods 
we classified the fair value of the kapoor warrants as a current liability in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging  formerly eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
this is a result of a requirement in the registration rights agreement entered into among the kapoor trust  ej funds and us on august  that the shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants be registered shares  which cannot be absolutely assured 
on june   we entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement the amended agreement with dr 
kapoor which modified certain terms related to our obligation to obtain and maintain registration of any shares issued pursuant to exercise of the kapoor warrants 
the amended agreement still requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement pursuant to rule of the securities act of registration statement for any shares of common stock that may be issued under the applicable warrant agreements  and to maintain the continuous effectiveness of such registration statement until the earliest of i the date no shares of the our common stock qualify as registrable securities  ii the date on which all of the registrable securities may be sold in a single transaction by the holder to the public pursuant to rule or similar rule  or iii the date upon which the john n 
kapoor trust dated september  the kapoor trust and ej funds  lp ej funds have transferred all of the registrable securities 
however  the registration rights agreement has been amended to explicitly state that in the event that we  after using good faith commercially reasonable efforts  are not able to obtain or maintain registration of the common stock  delivery of unregistered shares upon exercise of the kapoor warrants will be deemed acceptable and a net cash settlement will not be required 
the amended agreement further provides that the term commercially reasonable efforts in such instance shall not mean an absolute obligation of ours to obtain and maintain registration 
on june   upon entering into the amended agreement  we completed a final black scholes calculation of the fair value of the kapoor warrants and adjusted their book value accordingly  then reclassified the kapoor warrants from a current liability to a component of shareholders equity 
no future fair value adjustments are required 
the increases in fair value of the kapoor warrants were recorded as expenses under the caption change in fair value of warrants liability in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and we recorded expenses of million and million during and  respectively  related to the increase in fair value of the kapoor warrants 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the warrants at june  and december  were as follows june  december  expected volatility expected life in years risk free interest rate dividend yield the following table provides summarized information about the kapoor warrants fair values s granted to warrant identification grant date warrants granted exercise price at grant dates as of as of ej funds modification warrants apr  kapoor trust reimbursement warrants apr  ej funds credit facility warrants aug  kapoor trust subordinated note warrants aug  footnotes the modification warrants were granted to ej funds on april  when we signed the modification agreement with ej funds related to modifications made to our credit agreement following its assignment from ge capital to ej funds on march  those modifications included resetting the maximum loan commitment to million and setting the interest rate at a fixed per annum  among others 
the reimbursement warrants were granted to the kapoor trust on april  when we entered into a reimbursement and warrant agreement the reimbursement agreement with ej funds and the kapoor trust pursuant to which the kapoor trust agreed to provide the l c as security for our payment obligations to mbl under the mbl letter agreement and the mbl settlement agreement 
the credit facility warrants were granted to ej funds on august  in connection with the negotiated modification to the credit agreement increasing the total loan commitment from million to million 
the subordinated note warrants were issued to the kapoor trust on august  in connection with refinancing the subordinated note to extend its term for an additional five years and increase the principal from million to million to include accrued interest through august  contractual obligations in order to support the continued increase in the number of relevant and marketable pharmaceutical products that we market and sell  we will from time to time partner with outside firms for the development of selected products 
these development agreements frequently call for the payment of milestone payments as various steps in the process are completed in relation to product development and submission to the fda for approval 
the dollar amount of these payments is generally fixed contractually  assuming that the required milestones are achieved 
however  the timing of such payments is contingent based on a variety of factors and is therefore subject to change 
the amounts disclosed below under the caption strategic partners contingent payments represents our best estimate of the amount and expected timing of the milestone payments and other fees we expect to pay to outside development partners based on our current contractual agreements with them 
these milestone payments are accrued as liabilities on the company s balance sheets once the milestones have been achieved 
on december   we entered into the lundbeck agreement make sure this was defined earlier though which we acquired the nda rights to three branded  off patent drugs 
in addition to an initial cash payment of million  the lundbeck agreement committed us to paying additional consideration of million in cash on the third anniversary of the agreement date  assuming that subsequent sales of the applicable products achieved certain targets 
we believe that there is a strong likelihood that these targets will be reached and that the additional consideration will be paid when due 
this liability has been recorded on our books at the initial discounted value of million  which considers both the time value of money and the slight possibility that less than the full amount will ultimately become due 
as more fully described in properties on page  we lease the facilities that we occupy in gurnee  lake forest and skokie  illinois and in somerset  new jersey 
we also lease various pieces of office equipment at these facilities  as well as at our manufacturing plant in decatur  illinois 
our remaining obligations under these leases are summarized in the table below 
as of december   our principal financial obligation was related to our convertible notes 
we had no balance outstanding under our boa credit agreement at december  or any time since we entered into this agreement on october  the following table details our future contractual obligations as of december  in thousands description total and beyond current and long term debt contingent consideration acquisitions inventory purchase commitments leases strategic partners contingent payments total note the strategic partner payments are estimates which assume that various contingencies and market opportunities occur in and beyond critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize product sales for our ophthalmic  hospital drugs injectables  and biologics vaccines business segments upon the shipment of goods or upon the delivery of goods  depending on the sales terms 
the contract services segment  which produces products for third party customers based upon their specification at a pre determined price  also recognizes sales upon the shipment of goods or upon delivery of the product or service as appropriate 
revenue is recognized when all of our obligations have been fulfilled and collection of the related receivable is probable 
provision for estimated doubtful accounts  chargebacks  rebates  discounts and product returns is made at the time of sale and is analyzed and adjusted  if necessary  at each balance sheet date 
allowance for chargebacks and rebates we enter into contractual agreements with certain third parties such as hospitals and gpos to sell certain products at predetermined prices 
the parties have elected to have these contracts administered through wholesalers that buy the product from us and subsequently sell it to those third parties 
when a wholesaler sells products to one of the third parties that are subject to a contractual price agreement  the difference between the price paid to us by the wholesaler and the price under the specific contract is charged back to us by the wholesaler 
we track sales and submitted chargebacks by product number and contract for each wholesaler 
utilizing this information  we estimate a chargeback percentage for each product 
we reduce gross sales and increase the chargeback allowance by the estimated chargeback amount for each product sold to a wholesaler 
we reduce the chargeback allowance when we process a request for a chargeback from a wholesaler 
actual chargebacks processed can vary materially from period to period based upon actual sales volume through the wholesalers 
however  our provision for chargebacks is fully reserved for at the time when sales revenues are recognized 
we obtain certain wholesaler inventory reports to aid in analyzing the reasonableness of the chargeback allowance that will be paid out in the future 
we assess the reasonableness of our chargeback allowance by applying the product chargeback percentage based on historical activity to the quantities of inventory on hand per the wholesaler inventory reports and an estimate of in transit inventory that is not reported on the wholesaler inventory reports at the end of the period 
in accordance with our accounting policy  our estimate of the percentage amount of wholesaler inventory that will ultimately be sold to a third party that is subject to a contractual price agreement is based on a six quarter trend of such sales through wholesalers 
we use this percentage estimate until historical trends or new information indicates that a revision should be made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our actual chargeback rate experience and new trends are factored into our estimates each quarter as market conditions change 
the historical percentages that we have used during  and are as follows period start date period end date estimated of wholesaler inventory that will be subject to contractual price agreements january  june  july  june  july  current we will continue to use the estimate in future periods until trends indicate that a revision should be made 
similarly  we maintain an allowance for rebates related to fee for service contracts and other programs with certain customers 
rebate percentages vary by product and by volume purchased by each eligible customer 
we track sales by product number for each eligible customer and then apply the applicable rebate percentage  using both historical trends and actual experience to estimate our rebate allowance 
we reduce gross sales and increase the rebate allowance by the estimated rebate amount when we sell our products to our rebate eligible customers 
we reduce the rebate allowance when we process a customer request for a rebate 
at each balance sheet date  we analyze the allowance for rebates against actual rebates processed and make necessary adjustments as appropriate 
actual rebates processed can vary materially from period to period 
however  our provision for rebates is fully reserved for at the time when sales revenues are recognized 
the recorded allowances reflect our current estimate of the future chargeback and rebate liability to be paid or credited to our wholesaler and other customers under the various contracts and programs 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded chargeback and rebate expense of million  million and million  respectively 
the allowances for chargebacks and rebates were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the current year decline in our allowance for chargebacks and rebates was the result of a strategic decline in inventory carrying levels of our products at key wholesalers combined with our phase out of td vaccines 
this decline resulted in lower volume of product being subject to future chargeback and rebate claims 
allowance for product returns certain of our products are sold with the customer having the right to return the product within specified periods and guidelines for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to pending expiration dates 
provisions are made at the time of sale based upon tracked historical experience  by customer in some cases 
we estimate our required product returns reserve based on historical percentage of returns to sales by product  considering actual returns processed to date  the expected impact of product recalls and current wholesaler inventory levels of our products to assess the magnitude of unconsumed product that may result in future product returns 
we also consider one time historical return events or pending new developments that would impact the expected level of future returns 
for new products  we assess the market dynamics for that product and consider our past returns experience for similar products in our portfolio 
our sales returns level can be impacted by factors such as overall market demand and market competition and availability for substitute products which can increase or decrease the end user pull through for sales of our products and ultimately impact the level of sales returns 
actual returns experience and trends are factored into our estimates each quarter as market conditions change 
actual returns processed can vary materially from period to period 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a net provision for product returns of million  million  and million  respectively 
the decline in our provision compared to the prior year was primarily the result of improving our inventory management practices and reducing wholesaler inventory levels of our products 
the provision included an million provision related to our akten ophthalmic solution  along with increases due to lower than anticipated pull through on ophthalmic products and an increase in anticipated returns from wholesalers on certain other products 
as of december  and  our allowances for product returns were million and million  respectively 
allowance for coupons and promotions we issue coupons from time to time redeemable against our theratears eye care products 
upon release of coupons into the market  we record an estimate of the dollar value of coupons we expect to be redeemed 
this estimate is based on historical experience and is adjusted as needed based on actual redemptions 
in addition to couponing  from time to time we authorize various retailers to run in store promotional sales of our products 
upon confirmation that a promotion was run  we accrue an estimate of the dollar amount we expect to owe back to the retailer 
this estimate is trued up upon receipt of invoice from the retailer 
from the date of our acquisition of avr on may  though the end of the year  we recorded provisions for coupons and promotions totaling million 
as of december   the balance in our reserve for coupons and promotions was million 
allowance for doubtful accounts provisions for doubtful accounts  which reflect trade receivable balances owed to us that are believed to be uncollectible  are recorded as a component of sg a expenses 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our historical experience with collections and write offs  the credit quality of our customers and any recent or anticipated changes thereto  and the outstanding balances and past due amounts from our customers 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a net expense benefit for doubtful accounts of   and  respectively 
the expense in was related to accounts newly identified as uncollectible  while the reversal of expense in was due to recoveries and a reduction to previously estimated reserve requirements 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had a total of  of past due gross accounts receivable  of which  was more than days past due 
on a monthly basis  we perform a detailed analysis of the receivables due from our wholesaler customers and provide a specific reserve against known uncollectible items for each of the wholesaler customers 
we also include in the allowance for doubtful accounts an amount that we estimate to be uncollectible for all other customers based on a percentage of the past due receivables 
the percentage we reserve increases as the age of the receivables increases 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost average cost method or market 
we maintain an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value nrv 
for finished goods inventory  we estimate the amount of inventory that may not be sold prior to its expiration or is slow moving based upon recent sales activity by unit and wholesaler inventory information 
we also analyze our raw material and component inventory for slow moving items 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a provision for inventory obsolescence in cost of sales of million  million  and million  respectively 
the allowance for inventory obsolescence nrv was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when  based on management judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints or impediments to approval 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the product timeline for approval 
warranty liability the product warranty liability primarily relates to a ten year expiration guarantee on dtpa products sold to hhs in we are performing yearly stability studies for this product and  if the annual stability does not support the ten year product life  we will replace the product at no charge 
our supplier  hameln pharmaceuticals  will also share one half of this cost if the product does not meet the stability requirement 
if the ongoing product testing confirms the ten year stability for the dtpa products we will not incur a replacement cost and this reserve will be eliminated with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales after the ten year period 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and other tax credit carry forwards 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that will likely be in effect when the book to tax differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we recorded large net operating losses over the ten year period ended december  these losses produced large net operating loss nol carry forwards for which there was significant doubt regarding our ability to utilize them 
as result  we had maintained valuation allowances equal to of our net deferred tax assets for the past several years 
in the quarter ended september   we re evaluated the need for these valuation reserves based on our return to profitability over the past two years and our projected future earnings 
based on that evaluation  we determined that it is likely that we will be able to utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets 
therefore  in the quarter ended september   we reversed our valuation allowances 
intangibles our intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  trademarks and customer relationships acquired through business acquisitions and product licensing rights obtained through our acquisition of andas and ndas from other pharmaceutical companies 
goodwill is deemed to be an indefinite lived asset and is not amortized 
our other intangible assets are deemed to be finite lived and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
we regularly test all of our intangibles for impairment based on several factors  including estimated fair values and anticipated future cash flows from each asset 
we recorded amortization expense of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  in relation to our intangibles 
accumulated amortization was million and million at december  and  respectively 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that impairment may exist 
we use widely accepted valuation techniques to determine the fair value of our reporting units used in our annual goodwill impairment analysis 
our valuation is primarily based on qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding the fair value of goodwill relative to its carrying value 
we modeled the fair value of the reporting unit based on actual projected earnings and cash flows of the reporting unit 
we performed our annual impairment test on october  and determined that the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  no impairment charge was necessary 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and this cost is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes model for estimating the grant date fair value of the stock options we grant 
determining the assumptions that enter into the model is subjective and requires a certain amount of judgment 
we use an expected volatility that is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life assumption is based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee post vesting terminations experience 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the average market rate on us treasury securities in effect during the quarter in which the options were granted 
the dividend yield has historically been set at zero  reflecting the fact that we have not historically issued dividends and do not anticipate issuing dividends in the foreseeable future 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates in subsequent periods  when necessary  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic  presentation of comprehensive income  which converges the presentation of other comprehensive income oci in financial statements prepared under us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this guidance would require disclosure of reclassification adjustments from oci to net income 
in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 which deferred the effective date of this guidance to fiscal years beginning after december   with early election permitted 
we will adopt asu and make the required disclosures in fiscal year in september  the fasb issued asu  goodwill and other asc topic  testing goodwill for impairment  which added a simplified alternative method for performing annual goodwill impairment tests 
companies now have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the assessment indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the company no longer has to perform the two step impairment test 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or operating results 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement asc topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which was intended by the fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb to develop common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss 
additional disclosures required by this amendment include information about transfers between level and level instruments  information regarding the sensitivity of level instruments  and categorization by level of items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position but for which disclosure of fair value is still required 
the guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   our principal debt was related to our million of senior convertible notes due the convertible notes 
interest is accrued at a fixed rate of on the outstanding principal amount of the notes and is paid semi annually every june st and december st until the notes mature on june  since the interest rate is fixed  we have no market risk related to the convertible notes 
our million revolving credit and security agreement with bank of america  na calls for interest to accrue based on a premium above either the current prime rate or current libor rates 
therefore  borrowings pursuant to this revolving credit facility would be subject to market risk 
however  as of december   we had no outstanding balance and therefore no market risk related to this revolving credit facility 
as of december   we were subject to a measure of foreign exchange risk related to our agreement to acquire the principal manufacturing facility and ongoing business of kilitch drugs india limited kilitch  an indian pharmaceutical company whose business is conducted primarily in indian rupees 
we mitigated this risk by entering into a million  day non deliverable option transaction agreement the option agreement with bank of america  na on october   by which we protected ourselves against a decline in the exchange rate below indian rupees inr to us dollar usd 
the option agreement expired unexercised on january we subsequently closed on the kilitch acquisition on february  accordingly  we will be subject to foreign exchange risk in future periods based on changes in the inr usd exchange rate 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and the convertible notes 
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate book value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
likewise  as of december   the fair value of the convertible notes approximates their book value 
at december   the bulk of our cash and cash equivalents balance was invested in overnight instruments  the interest rates of which may change daily 
accordingly  these overnight investments are to market risk
