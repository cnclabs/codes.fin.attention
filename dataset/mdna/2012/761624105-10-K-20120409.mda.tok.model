item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
real estate operations at january   we had lease agreements  as landlord  for six owned former retail stores  square feet 
we have owned former retail stores  square feet  that are vacant at january  we are marketing these vacant properties to lease or sell 
in addition  one former distribution center is partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
a typical lease agreement has an initial term of five to twenty years with renewal options 
most of our lessees are responsible for a portion of maintenance  taxes and other executory costs 
we require our lessees to maintain adequate levels of insurance 
we recognized lease revenue of approximately  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
retail when we operated retail stores  we offered extended service contracts to our customers which typically provided  inclusive of manufacturers warranties  one to five years of warranty coverage 
we plan to manage and administer these contracts and to recognize the associated deferred income and expenses  including the cost to repair or replace covered products  over the remaining life of the contracts 
we have classified as discontinued operations all retail related activities  including those activities associated with extended service plans  in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
facilities at january   we owned six former retail store properties that were leased to outside  unrelated parties 
there were also vacant former retail store properties that we were attempting to either lease or sell 
in addition  we have one former distribution center that is partially leased  partially occupied by our corporate office and partially vacant 
our consolidated ethanol entities own a combined acres of land and two facilities with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons of ethanol each 
employees at january   we had six employees supporting our corporate functions 
at january   one earth and nugen combined  had employees 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we expect this employment level to remain relatively stable 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
service marks we have registered our service mark rex  and we own an application to register the mark farmers energy  with the united states patent and trademark office 
we are not aware of any adverse claims concerning our service marks 
item a 
risk factors we encourage you to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in rex common stock 
any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur 
if one or more of these events do occur  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in this instance  the trading price of rex stock could decline  and investors might lose all or part of their investment 
we have concentrations of cash deposits at financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits 
we generally have cash deposits that exceed federal insurance limits 
should the financial institutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvency or other financial difficulty  our access to cash deposits could be limited 
in extreme cases  we could lose our cash deposits entirely 
this would negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations 
the current interest rate environment has resulted in lower yields on our excess cash 
we have experienced lower yields on our excess cash compared to historical yields 
should the present economic conditions result in a sustained period of historically low interest rates  our interest income would be negatively impacted 
risks related to our synthetic fuel investments and income tax benefits we face synthetic fuel risks as future irs audits may result in the disallowance of previously recognized tax credits 
we have recognized investment income of approximately million from the sales of our partnership interests from years that the partnerships have not been audited by the internal revenue service irs 
should the tax credits be denied on any future audit and we fail to prevail through the irs or the legal process  there could be significant refunds of previously recognized income with a significant adverse impact on earnings and cash flows 
the production and sale of synthetic fuel qualified for section k tax credits if certain requirements were satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce the synthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from a facility placed in service before july  we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million of alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards recorded as deferred tax assets on our consolidated financial statements 
should future results of operations or other factors cause us to determine that it is not more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  we would then be required to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets 
we would increase our income tax expense by the amount of the tax benefit we do not expect to realize 
this would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position 
risks related to our alternative energy business our ethanol investments are subject to the risks of an inexperienced business which could adversely affect returns on our ethanol investments and our results of operations 
we do not have long term experience investing in the ethanol industry 
we entered into our first agreement to invest in an ethanol plant in november at january   we were invested in five entities that own and operate seven ethanol production facilities 
one facility has been in production since  but the remaining facilities all became operational or were acquired in fiscal year or later 
our ethanol investments have been managed by our chief executive officer  our chief operating officer and our chief financial officer 
we do not otherwise have a dedicated ethanol development or management staff at the parent company level 
as a consequence  our ethanol investments are subject to risks including an unproven business model  a lack of operating history and an undeveloped operating structure 
these risks could result in our making investments in ethanol plants that perform substantially below our expectations  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if cash flow from operations of our ethanol plants is not sufficient to service debt  the plants could fail and we could lose our entire investment 
our ethanol plants financed approximately of plant construction cost with debt 
the debt typically has a balloon payment due after five years 
the ability of each company owning the plant to repay borrowings incurred will depend upon the plant s financial and operating performance 
the cash flows and capital resources of an ethanol plant may be insufficient to repay its debt obligations 
if a plant cannot service its debt  it may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  restructure its indebtedness or seek additional capital 
if unable to do so  the value of our investment could decline significantly 
the institutional senior lenders to the companies which own and operate our ethanol plants hold liens on the plant s assets 
if a company fails to make its debt service payments  the senior lender will have the right to repossess the plant s assets in addition to other remedies  which are superior to our rights as an equity investor 
such action could have a material adverse impact on our investment in the ethanol plant 
we operate in a capital intensive industry 
limitations to external financing could adversely affect our financial performance 
in general  continued volatility in the capital markets has resulted in reduced availability of capital for the ethanol industry 
we may need to incur additional financing to fund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements such as increases in raw material costs 
any delays to obtain additional financing  or our inability to do so  could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
the financial returns on our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices  which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty  and the availability of supplies  so our results could fluctuate substantially 
the financial returns on our ethanol investments are substantially dependent on commodity prices  especially prices for corn or other feedstock  natural gas  ethanol and unleaded gasoline 
as a result of the volatility of the prices for these items  the returns may fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for their raw materials  which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants 
our returns on ethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices 
corn is the principal raw material our ethanol plants use to produce ethanol and co products 
as a result  changes in the price of corn can significantly affect their businesses 
rising corn prices result in higher costs of ethanol and co products 
because ethanol competes with non corn based fuels  our ethanol plants generally will be unable to pass along increased grain costs to their customers 
at certain levels  grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical to produce 
the price of corn is influenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields  transportation costs  farmer planting decisions  exports  the value of the us dollar and general economic  market and regulatory factors 
these factors include government policies and subsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply 
the significance and relative effect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict 
any event that tends to negatively affect the supply of corn  such as adverse weather or crop disease  could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants 
increasing domestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices 
our ethanol plants may also have difficulty  from time to time  in physically sourcing corn on economical terms due to supply shortages 
such a shortage could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effect on the financial returns on our ethanol investments and our consolidated results of operations 
the spread between ethanol and corn prices can vary significantly 
the gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread between ethanol and corn prices 
fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur 
a sustained narrow spread or any further reduction in the spread between ethanol and corn prices  whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices  would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants 
our risk management strategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity 
in an attempt to partially offset the impact of volatility of commodity prices  we enter into forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillers grains production and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements 
the financial impact of these risk management activities is dependent upon  among other items  the prices involved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved 
risk management activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchased in a declining market or when positions are sold in an increasing market 
we vary the amount of risk management techniques we utilize  and we may choose not to engage in any risk management activities 
should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodities prices  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the market for natural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants use in their manufacturing process 
our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas  which is consumed as fuel in the production of ethanol 
the prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions 
these market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants control  such as weather conditions  overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations 
significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair the ethanol plants ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers 
furthermore  increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants 
fluctuations in the selling price of commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants 
ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline  as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and  to a lesser extent  as a gasoline substitute 
as a result  ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanol plants results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand decreases 
distillers grains compete with other protein based animal feed products 
the price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease 
the prices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which their products are made 
historically  sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn 
however  there have been instances when the price increase for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices 
the production of distillers grains has increased as a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the united states 
this could lead to price declines in what we can sell our distillers grains for in the future 
such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results of operations 
increased ethanol production or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry  which may cause the price of ethanol  distillers grains and corn oil to decrease 
according to the rfa  domestic ethanol production nameplate capacity has increased to approximately billion gallons per year at january the rfa estimates that  as of january  approximately million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction 
excess capacity in the ethanol industry would have an adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
in a manufacturing industry with excess capacity  producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production ie  the cost of producing only the next unit  without regard for interest  overhead or fixed costs 
this incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs 
excess capacity may also result from decreases in the demand for ethanol  which could result from a number of factors  including  but not limited to  regulatory developments and reduced us gasoline consumption 
reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices for gasoline or crude oil  which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquire hybrid vehicles 
in addition  because ethanol production produces distillers grains and corn oil as co products  increased ethanol production will also lead to increased supplies of distillers grains and corn oil 
an increase in the supply of distillers grains and corn oil  without corresponding increases in demand  could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanol plants distillers grains and corn oil production 
a decline in the price of distillers grains or corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
trade restrictions on ethanol exports could reduce the demand for ethanol 
the european union initiated an anti dumping and anti subsidy investigation regarding united states exports of ethanol to europe and united states policies surrounding ethanol production and use 
if producers and exporters of ethanol are subject to trade restrictions  or additional duties are imposed on exports  it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol 
this could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the united sates which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
we depend on our partners to operate certain of our ethanol investments 
our investments currently represent both majority and minority equity positions 
day to day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the local farmers cooperative or investor group that has promoted the plant 
we may not have the ability to directly modify the operations of these plants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants 
in addition  local plant operators  who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants  may have interests  such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops  that may differ from our interest  which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant 
the limitations on our ability to control day to day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations 
we may not successfully acquire or develop additional ethanol investments 
the growth of our ethanol business depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments 
our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals  and introductions  to new investment opportunities from industry participants  such as ethanol plant builders  financial institutions  marketing agents and others 
we must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants  and a material disruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments 
any expansion strategy will depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectations of future market conditions 
there is increasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants 
even if suitable sites or opportunities are identified  we may not be able to secure the services and products from contractors  engineering firms  construction firms and equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economic terms 
construction costs associated with expansion may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable to operate 
additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy  which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms 
our ethanol plants may be adversely affected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful 
the development and implementation of new technologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production 
for instance  any technological advances in the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive  cellulosic sources such as wheat  oat or barley straw could have an adverse effect on our ethanol plants  because those facilities are designed to produce ethanol from corn  which is  by comparison  a raw material with other high value uses 
we cannot predict when new technologies may become available  the rate of acceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies 
in addition  advances in the development of alternatives to ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol 
any advances in technology which require significant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
in addition  alternative fuels  additives and oxygenates are continually under development 
alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed  which may decrease the demand for ethanol 
it is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performance could reduce the use of oxygenates  which would lower the demand for ethanol  and the results of our ethanol operations may be materially adversely affected 
the us ethanol industry is highly dependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
the elimination of the blender s credit could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
the american jobs creation act of created the volumetric ethanol tax credit  referred to as the blender s credit 
this credit allowed gasoline distributors who blended ethanol with gasoline to receive a federal excise tax credit of per gallon of pure ethanol  or per gallon if blended with ethanol e  and per gallon if blended with ethanol e 
the per gallon incentive for ethanol expired on december  this credit was a significant benefit to our customers and the elimination of this credit makes our product less attractive to customers 
the effect of the renewable fuel standard rfs program in the energy independence and security act of the act is uncertain 
the domestic market for ethanol is largely dictated by federal mandates for blending ethanol with gasoline 
the rfs mandate level for conventional biofuels for of billion gallons is lower than current domestic production levels 
future demand will be largely dependent upon the economic incentives to blend based upon the relative value of gasoline versus ethanol  taking into consideration the relative octane value of ethanol  environmental requirements and the rfs 
any significant increase in production capacity beyond the rfs level could have a negative impact on ethanol prices 
additionally  the rfs mandate with respect to ethanol derived from grain could be reduced or waived entirely 
a reduction or waiver of the rfs mandate could negatively affect ethanol prices and our future performance 
the rfs flexibility act was introduced on october  in the us house of representatives to reduce or eliminate the volumes of renewable fuel use required by rfs based upon corn stocks to use ratios 
the domestic alternative fuels act of was introduced on january  in the us house of representatives to modify the rfs to include ethanol and other fuels produced from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas 
our operations and resulting financial performance could be adversely impacted if the rfs flexibility act or the domestic alternative fuels act of are enacted into law 
changes in corporate average fuel economy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices 
flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meeting federally mandated corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers 
high blend ethanol fuels such as e result in lower fuel efficiencies 
absent the cafe preferences  car makers would not likely build flexible fuel vehicles 
any change in cafe preferences could reduce the growth of e markets and result in lower ethanol prices 
various studies have criticized the efficiency of ethanol  in general  and corn based ethanol in particular  which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs that promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel 
although many trade groups  academics and governmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment  others have criticized ethanol production as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting water resources 
other studies have suggested that corn based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy  meat and other foodstuffs from livestock that consume corn to increase 
if these views gain acceptance  support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn based ethanol could decline  leading to reduction or repeal of these measures 
these views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel 
federal support of cellulosic ethanol may result in reduced incentives to corn derived ethanol producers 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of and the energy independence and security act of provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass and poplar trees 
the amended rfs mandates an increasing level of production of non corn derived biofuels 
these federal policies may suggest a long term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass  silage or wood chips 
cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market 
several cellulosic ethanol plants are under development and there is a risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol 
our plants are designed as single feedstock facilities  located in corn production areas with limited alternative feedstock nearby  and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol 
the adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business 
our ethanol business is affected by environmental and other regulations which could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants 
our ethanol production facilities are subject to extensive air  water and other environmental regulations 
we have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate our plants 
regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or which increase our costs 
more stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operating costs or require us to expend considerable resources 
our ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutants as by products of the ethanol production process  including carbon dioxide 
in  the us supreme court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the clean air act in a case seeking to require the epa to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions 
in february  the epa released its final regulations on the renewable fuel standard program rfs 
we believe our plants are grandfathered at their current operating capacity  but plant expansion will need to meet a threshold reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions from a baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the rfs mandate 
to expand our plant capacity  we may be required to obtain additional permits  install advanced technology such as corn oil extraction  or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains 
we may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps in order to comply with future laws or regulations 
compliance with future laws or regulations of carbon dioxide  or if we choose to expand capacity at certain of our plants  compliance with then current regulations of carbon dioxide  could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably  which may have a negative impact on our financial performance 
the california air resources board carb has adopted a low carbon fuel standard lcfs requiring a reduction in ghg emissions from transportation fuels by an indirect land use charge is included in this lifecycle ghg emission calculation 
on december   the us district court for the eastern district of california issued several rulings in federal lawsuits challenging the lcfs 
one of the rulings preliminarily prevents carb from enforcing these regulations during the pending litigation 
on january   carb unsuccessfully attempted to appeal these rulings in the us district court for the eastern district of california and on january  filed another appeal with the ninth circuit court of appeals 
while this standard is currently being challenged by various lawsuits  implementation of such a standard may have an adverse impact on the market for corn based ethanol in california 
while this standard is being challenged by lawsuits  implementation of such a standard could have an adverse impact on the market for corn based ethanol in california if corn based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle ghg emission reductions 
this could have a negative impact on our financial performance 
our revenue from the sale of distillers grains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed 
distillers grains is a co product from the fermentation of corn to produce ethanol 
antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination  therefore antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed 
the u 
s 
food and drug administration s  or fda s  center for veterinary medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards from the use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues 
if the public became concerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed  the market for distillers grains could be negatively impacted  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
at certain of our plants  we extract and sell non edible corn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains 
several studies are trying to determine how corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains 
if it is determined that corn oil extraction adversely impacts the energy content of distillers grains  the value of the distillers grains we sell may be negatively impacted  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
the price of distillers grains may decline as a result of china s anti dumping investigation of distillers grains originating in the united sates 
estimates indicate that as much as to percent of the distiller grains produced in the united states will be exported to china in the coming year 
however  this export market may be jeopardized if the chinese government imposes trade barriers in response to the outcome of an antidumping investigation currently being conducted by the chinese ministry of commerce 
if producers and exporters of distiller grains are subjected to trade barriers when selling distiller grains to chinese customers  there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grains in the united states 
declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably 
we face significant competition in the ethanol industry 
we face significant competition for new ethanol investment opportunities 
there are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry 
some enterprises provide financial and management support similar to our business model 
other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants which they will directly own and operate 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
we must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development of ethanol plant opportunities 
we may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy 
the ethanol industry is primarily comprised of smaller entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol along with their base grain business 
recently  several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market 
if these companies increase their ethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production  there would be less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers like our ethanol plants 
larger firms offer efficiencies and economies of scale  resulting in lower costs of production 
in addition  plants sold as part of a bankruptcy proceeding may have significantly lower costs than our ethanol plants 
absent significant growth and diversification  our ethanol plants may not be able to operate profitably in a more competitive environment 
no assurance can be given that our ethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resources will not have a materially adverse affect on the results of our ethanol operations 
we may face competition from foreign companies 
there is a risk of foreign competition in the ethanol industry 
brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world 
brazil s ethanol production  which is sugarcane based  has historically been cheaper to produce than corn based ethanol 
if significant additional foreign ethanol production capacity is created  such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol  which may result in lower prices of ethanol 
in addition  foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours 
these risks could have significant adverse effects on our financial performance 
we are exposed to credit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers 
the inability of a customer to make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to make our payments when due 
we may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants 
our ability to attract and retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability 
competition for key plant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense  and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees 
failure to do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants 
our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and water to operate 
unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business 
our plants require a significant and uninterrupted supply of natural gas  electricity and water to operate 
we generally rely on third parties to provide these resources 
if there is an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason  such as supply  delivery or mechanical problems and we are unable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations  we may be required to stop production 
a production halt for an extended period of time could result in material losses 
potential business disruption from factors outside our control  including natural disasters  severe weather conditions  accidents  strikes  unexpected equipment failures and unforeseen plant shutdowns  could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results 
our failure to effectively integrate the recently completed acquisition of nugen could result in an inability to realize the anticipated benefits of the purchase and adversely affect our business and operating results 
our recent acquisition of nugen will involve the integration of a company that had previously operated independently  which is challenging and time consuming 
the process of integrating nugen  a previously privately held company  into rex  a publicly traded company  could result in the loss of key employees  the disruption of its ongoing businesses  or inconsistencies in the respective standards  controls  procedures  and policies of the two companies  any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers  suppliers  and employees 
in addition  the successful combination of the companies will require rex to dedicate significant management resources and to potentially expend additional funds for additional staffing  resources and control procedures  all of which could temporarily divert attention from the day to day business of the combined company 
if we fail to complete an effective integration of nugen into rex  anticipated growth in revenue  profitability  and cash flow resulting from the purchase of nugen could be adversely affected 
the debt agreements for the ethanol plants contain restrictive financial and performance covenants 
our subsidiaries that operate ethanol plants ethanol subsidiaries have debt agreements that contain covenants with several financial and performance restrictions 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement 
if a default were to occur  the ethanol subsidiary would likely seek a waiver of that default  attempt to reset the covenant  or refinance the instrument and accompanying obligations 
if the ethanol subsidiary was unable to obtain this relief  the default could result in the acceleration of the total due related to that debt obligation 
if a default were to occur  the ethanol subsidiary may not be able to pay its debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them 
in addition  certain lease agreements could also be in default if a default of the debt agreement occurs 
any of these events  if they occur  could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the debt agreements for the ethanol plants limit  or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol subsidiaries can transfer to their members 
we are dependent on dividends from our ethanol subsidiaries to generate cash flow 
presently  all of our ethanol subsidiaries have debt agreements that limit payments to members 
therefore  these companies cannot distribute all of the cash they generate to their members 
furthermore  we may not be able to use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary 
changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
one earth and patriot have interest rate swaps at january  that  in essence  fix the interest rate on a portion of their variable rate debt 
during fiscal years  and  we recognized losses on these swaps 
further reductions in interest rates could increase the liability position of the interest rate swaps  requiring us to record additional expense which could be material 
the liability for these interest rate swaps could also result in a default of the term loan agreements restrictive financial covenants 
in addition  increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on results of operations as all of the debt our ethanol plants have is variable rate debt 
furthermore  the interest rate swaps do not fix the interest rate on the entire portion of the related debt 
we rely on information technology in our operations and financial reporting and any material failure  inadequacy  interruption or security breach of that technology could harm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely 
we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations  including for management of inventory  purchase orders  production  invoices  shipping  accounting and various other processes and transactions 
our ability to effectively manage our business  coordinate the production  distribution and sale of our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems 
the failure of these systems to operate effectively  problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems  or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber attack or otherwise could cause delays in product sales  reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financial results 
significant capital investments could be required to remediate any such problem 
security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietary data could also adversely impact our reputation  and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties 
risks related to the wind down and exit of our retail business and risks related to our real estate segment 
our future costs associated with administering extended product service contracts may result in higher than expected costs 
we will continue to administer extended product service contracts that have contractual maturities over the next three years 
to the extent we do not have products or an adequate repair service network to satisfy warranty claims  we may incur material costs as we would be required to refund cash to customers for warranted products 
we have a significant amount of vacant warehouse and retail space after the completion of the wind down of our retail business 
at january   we own one distribution facility and former retail store properties comprising approximately  square feet that are completely or partially vacant 
we are currently marketing these facilities for lease or sale 
we may not be able to successfully lease or sell these properties which could result in lost opportunities for revenue or future impairment charges related to the carrying value of the associated assets 
we also have costs related to the vacant properties such as property taxes and utilities that we would have to bear without any revenue from such properties

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview historically  we were a specialty retailer in the consumer electronics and appliance industry serving small to medium sized towns and communities 
in addition  we have been an investor in various alternative energy entities beginning with synthetic fuel partnerships in and later ethanol production facilities beginning in in fiscal year  we began to evaluate strategic alternatives for our retail segment with a focus on closing unprofitable or marginally profitable retail stores and monetizing our retail related real estate assets 
we did not believe that we were generating an adequate return from our retail business due to the competitive nature of the consumer electronics and appliance industry and the overall economic conditions in the united states 
we completed our exit of the retail business as of july  going forward  our only retail related activities will consist of the administration of extended service plans we previously sold and the payment of related claims 
all activities related to extended service plans are classified as discontinued operations 
at january   we had lease agreements for all or parts of six former retail properties and had vacant former retail properties 
we also own one former distribution center  which is partially leased  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel and partially vacant 
we are marketing the vacant properties to lease or sell 
should our marketing efforts result in additional tenants to whom we lease property  we would expect to execute leases with a term of five to twenty years 
we currently have equity investments in five ethanol production entities  two of which we have a majority ownership interest in 
we may make additional investments in the alternative energy segment during fiscal year our ethanol operations are highly dependent on commodity prices  especially prices for corn  ethanol  distillers grains and natural gas 
as a result of price volatility for these commodities  our operating results can fluctuate substantially 
the price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general  including crop conditions  weather  federal policy and foreign trade 
because the market price of ethanol is not always directly related to corn prices  at times ethanol prices may lag movements in corn prices and  in an environment of higher prices  reduce the overall margin structure at the plants 
as a result  at times  we may operate our plants at negative or marginally positive operating margins 
we expect our ethanol plants to produce approximately gallons of denatured ethanol for each bushel of grain processed in the production cycle 
we refer to the difference between the price per gallon of ethanol and the price per bushel of grain divided by as the crush spread 
should the crush spread decline  our ethanol plants are likely to generate operating results that do not provide adequate cash flows for sustained periods of time 
in such cases  production at the ethanol plants may be reduced or stopped altogether in order to minimize variable costs at individual plants 
we expect these decisions to be made on an individual plant basis  as there are different market conditions at each of our ethanol plants 
we attempt to manage the risk related to the volatility of grain and ethanol prices by utilizing forward grain purchase and forward ethanol and distillers grain sale contracts 
we attempt to match quantities of ethanol and distillers grains sale contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed 
however  the market for future ethanol sales contracts is not a mature market 
consequently  we generally execute contracts for no more than three months into the future at any given time 
as a result of the relatively short period of time our contracts cover  we generally cannot predict the future movements in the crush spread for more than three months  thus  we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future income or loss from the operations of our ethanol facilities 
the crush spread realized in was subject to significant volatility 
for calendar year  the average chicago board of trade cbot near month corn price was approximately per bushel  ranging from a low of approximately per bushel in october to a high of approximately per bushel in june ethanol prices had significant fluctuations ranging from approximately per gallon in december to approximately per gallon in july 
ethanol and corn prices have tended to trade in the same direction but with varying spreads 
in  the cbot crush spread ranged from a low of approximately negative per gallon to a high of approximately per gallon 
we believe ethanol demand in was impacted by the expiration of the volumetric ethanol tax credit blender credit as of december  crush spreads have continued to decline in and have remained negative absent the consideration of distillers grains and corn oil 
prices for distillers grains we sell generally trend with grain prices 
these prices have partially offset the decline in the crush spread 
we reported segment profit before income taxes and noncontrolling interests from our alternative energy segment of approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year the increase in profitability primarily resulted from increased periods of ownership of the nugen plant for the current year and impairment charges and loss on deconsolidation of levelland hockley recognized in fiscal year of approximately million 
levelland hockley reported a loss from operations in fiscal year and as a result of narrowing crush spreads was shut down in january we expect that future operating results from our consolidated ethanol plants will be based upon combined annual production of between and million gallons of ethanol  which assumes that one earth and nugen will operate at or near nameplate capacity 
however  due to the inherent volatility of the crush spread  we cannot predict the likelihood of future operating results being similar to the results 
ethanol investments in fiscal year  we entered the alternative energy industry by investing in several entities organized to construct and  subsequently operate  ethanol producing plants 
historically  we invested in six entities one of which was divested and five of which we remain invested in as of january   utilizing equity investments 
the following table is a summary of our ethanol investments in operating plants at january  entity trailing months ethanol gallons sold rex s current ownership interest current effective ownership of trailing months ethanol gallons sold one earth energy  llc m m nugen energy  llc m m patriot renewable fuels  llc m m big river resources w burlington  llc m m big river resources galva  llc m m big river united energy  llc m m big river resources boyceville  llc m m total m m our current effective annual gallons sold represents one month of ownership of big river resources boyceville  llc 
the table excludes levelland hockley  which ceased production in january one earth commenced production operations late in the second quarter of fiscal year and began generating revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year effective november   we acquired an additional equity interest in nugen which operates an ethanol producing facility in marion  south dakota with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons of ethanol and  tons of ddg per year 
this acquisition resulted in our ownership interest in nugen increasing to 
patriot commenced production operations in the second quarter of fiscal year big river completed construction in the second quarter of fiscal year of its second plant which has an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons of ethanol and  tons of ddg per year 
the plant is located in galva  illinois 
in august  big river acquired a interest in an ethanol production facility which has an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons of ethanol and  tons of ddg per year 
the plant is located in dyersville  iowa 
in december  big river acquired a interest in an ethanol production facility which has an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons of ethanol and  tons of ddg per year 
the plant is located in boyceville  wisconsin 
the levelland hockley plant was shut down in early january as a result of industry wide low crush spread margins and the plant s inability to source grain at affordable prices 
on january  we sold  of our membership units to levelland hockley for  reducing our ownership interest in levelland hockley to 
as a result  we no longer have a controlling financial interest in levelland hockley  and  therefore  effective january   we deconsolidated levelland hockley and began using the equity method of accounting to account for the results of levelland hockley 
in connection with the deconsolidation  we recorded our remaining noncontrolling equity interest and our debt investments at fair value 
our estimate of fair value for all of our investments in levelland hockley was at january  we recorded a pretax charge of approximately million as a result of deconsolidating levelland hockley and writing our remaining investments in levelland hockley to at january  on april   levelland hockley voluntarily filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court  northern district of texas 
as a result  we no longer can exercise significant influence over levelland hockley and began using the cost method of accounting 
there has been no change in the carrying value of our investments in levelland hockley as a result of the change to the cost method of accounting 
investment in synthetic fuel partnerships we had invested in three limited partnerships which owned facilities producing synthetic fuel 
the partnerships earned federal income tax credits under section k of the internal revenue code based upon the tonnage and content of solid synthetic fuel produced and sold to unrelated parties 
the section k tax credit program expired on december  during fiscal year  we sold our membership interest in a limited liability company that owned a synthetic fuel facility in gillette  wyoming 
in addition to certain other payments  the company was eligible to receive per ton of qualified production produced by the facility and sold through december the plant was subsequently sold and during fiscal year  the company modified its agreement with the owners and operators of the synthetic fuel facility 
during fiscal year  a final payment of million was received with respect to the qualified production 
income related to this payment was recognized during fiscal year  as collectability of the amount became assured 
we will not receive additional payments  or recognize additional income  from this investment 
real estate operations at january   we had lease agreements  as landlord  for six owned former retail stores  square feet 
we have owned former retail stores  square feet that are vacant at january  we are marketing these vacant properties to lease or sell 
in addition  one former distribution center is partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
retail we completed the exit of our retail business during the second quarter of fiscal year we offered extended service contracts to our customers which typically provide  inclusive of manufacturers warranties  one to five years of warranty coverage 
we plan to manage and administer these contracts over the life of the contracts 
service contract repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
we expect to continue recognizing extended service contract revenues and expenses as discontinued operations through january  although the revenues will decline annually as we are no longer selling new contracts 
we typically service a warranty claim through a network of third party repair and service providers 
warranty repair costs have been in the range of to of extended service contract revenue over the last three years  we expect these costs to average approximately to of extended service contract revenue in future years 
future expected amortization of deferred revenue and commission expense are as follows amounts in thousands years ended january  deferred revenue deferred commission expense total results of operations for a detailed analysis of period to period changes  see the segment discussion that follows this section as this is how management views and monitors our business 
comparison of fiscal years ended january  and net sales and revenue net sales and revenue in fiscal year were approximately million  a increase from approximately million in fiscal year net sales and revenue do not include sales from retail and real estate properties that have been sold and classified in discontinued operations 
the increase was primarily caused by higher sales in our alternative energy segment of approximately million 
this increase is primarily a result of higher commodity prices during fiscal year and the acquisition of nugen completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year net sales and revenue from our real estate segment increased million over the prior year to approximately million 
the following table reflects the approximate percent of net sales and revenue for each product and service group for the periods presented fiscal year product or service category ethanol distillers grains leasing total gross profit gross profit was approximately million in fiscal year  or of net sales and revenue  versus approximately million in fiscal year or of net sales and revenue 
this represents an increase of approximately million 
gross profit for fiscal year increased by approximately million over the prior year as a result of operations in the alternative energy segment 
gross loss for fiscal year increased by approximately million compared to the prior year from our real estate segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were approximately million of net sales and revenue  an increase of approximately million or from approximately million of net sales and revenue for fiscal year compared to the prior year  these expenses increased approximately million in the alternative energy segment and decreased approximately million in the corporate and other category 
equity in income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates during fiscal years and  we recognized income of approximately million and million  respectively  from our equity investments in big river  patriot and nugen 
big river has a plant with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons which has been in operation since big river opened an additional plant with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons during the second quarter of fiscal year  acquired a ownership in a plant with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons in august and acquired a ownership in a plant with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons in december patriot has an ethanol facility with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons which has been in operation since the second quarter of fiscal year effective november   we acquired an additional equity interest in nugen which operates an ethanol producing facility in marion  south dakota with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons 
this acquisition increased our ownership in nugen to 
we acquired our initial equity interest in nugen on july  income from big river and patriot in fiscal year was relatively consistent with fiscal year levels 
income from big river was approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  big river benefited in the current year from increases in by product pricing and patronage dividends 
income from patriot was approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
income from nugen was approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase results primarily from increased crush spreads realized and recognizing ten months of equity method income from nugen in fiscal year versus six months of equity method income from nugen in fiscal year effective november   we ceased using the equity method of accounting for nugen and began consolidating the results of nugen 
overall  we expect the trends in crush spread margins described in the overview section to be generally consistent with the operating experience of big river and patriot as their results are dependent on the same key drivers corn and natural gas pricing as well ethanol pricing 
due to the inherent volatility of the crush spread  we cannot predict the likelihood of future operating results from big river and patriot being similar to the fiscal year results 
impairment charges and loss on deconsolidation during fiscal year  we recognized losses totaling approximately million related to the impairment of notes receivable from levelland hockley and the deconsolidation of levelland hockley 
effective january   we sold a portion of our equity interest in levelland hockley 
as a result  we no longer have a controlling financial interest in levelland hockley  and  therefore  effective january   we deconsolidated levelland hockley and recorded our retained investment at fair value as of january  we recognized an impairment loss related to the notes receivable of approximately million during fiscal year we also recognized a loss on deconsolidation of approximately million during fiscal year bargain purchase gain  net on november   we acquired of the outstanding membership units of nugen  which resulted in us owning approximately of the outstanding membership units in nugen 
we applied acquisition accounting for this business combination achieved in stages  and recognized a loss of approximately million by remeasuring the fair value of our equity method investment at the acquisition date and a bargain purchase gain of approximately million related to the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed exceeding our consideration given for such net assets 
income from synthetic fuel investments during fiscal year we received approximately million as final payment related to the sale of our membership interest in a limited liability company that owned a synthetic fuel facility in gillette  wyoming 
we will not receive nor recognize any additional amounts from the sale of our membership interest 
interest income interest income of approximately million for fiscal year was consistent with fiscal year interest expense interest expense decreased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the alternative energy segment as we had higher interest expense in fiscal year as a result of consolidating the results of levelland hockley for a majority of the prior year 
the decrease was partially offset as a result of consolidating nugen effective november  loss on early termination of debt during fiscal years and  we completed the early payoff of mortgage debt prior to maturity 
as a result  we expensed certain unamortized financing costs and prepayment penalties of approximately  and  during fiscal years and  respectively  as loss on early termination of debt 
other income other income increased to approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year income recognized by nugen related to dividends paid by a co operative during the current year is the primary reason for the increase 
we do not expect other income to be significant in future periods 
losses on derivative financial instruments we recognized losses of approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  related to forward interest rate swaps that one earth entered into during fiscal year one of the swaps expired in july and one expires in july in general  declining interest rates have a negative effect on our interest rate swaps as our swaps fixed the interest rate of variable rate debt 
as interest rates declined during fiscal years and  we incurred losses on the interest rate swap 
should interest rates continue to decline  we would expect to experience continued losses on the remaining interest rate swap 
we would expect to incur gains on the interest rate swap should interest rates increase 
we cannot predict the future movements in interest rates  thus  we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future gains or losses related to the interest rate swap 
income taxes our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
our effective rate is impacted by the noncontrolling interests of the companies we consolidate  as we recognize of their income or loss in continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 
however  we only provide an income tax provision or benefit for our portion of the subsidiaries income or loss with a noncontrolling interest 
in addition  our effective rate was favorably impacted by approximately during the current year as a result of domestic production activities deductions resulting from operations at certain of our ethanol plants 
income from continuing operations as a result of the foregoing  income from continuing operations was approximately million for fiscal year versus approximately million for fiscal year discontinued operations during fiscal year  we closed our remaining retail store and warehouse operations and reclassified all retail related results as discontinued operations 
as a result of these closings and certain other retail store and real estate property closings from prior years  we had income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of approximately million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year this income includes the amortization of deferred income related to extended service contracts sold when we operated the former retail segment 
eight properties classified as discontinued operations were sold during fiscal year  resulting in a gain  net of taxes  of approximately million 
we sold or disposed of ten former retail store locations classified as discontinued operations in fiscal year  as a result  we had a gain from disposal of discontinued operations  net of taxes  of approximately million in fiscal year we expect income from discontinued operations to decline in future periods as our extended service plan activities wind down 
noncontrolling interests income or loss related to noncontrolling interests was approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  and represents the owners other than us share of the income or loss of one earth full year of fiscal year and nugen fourth quarter of fiscal year and one earth and levelland hockley fiscal year 
noncontrolling interests of one earth and nugen were approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal year noncontrolling interests of one earth and levelland hockley were approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal year net income attributable to rex common shareholders as a result of the foregoing  net income attributable to rex common shareholders was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year business segment results we have two segments alternative energy and real estate 
the real estate segment was formerly included in the retail segment 
for former retail stores and warehouses closed which we have a retained interest in the related real estate  operations are now presented in the real estate segment based upon when retail operations ceased 
historical results from retail store operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our business segments and corporate and other 
as discussed in note  our chief operating decision maker as defined by accounting standards codification asc segment reporting evaluates the operating performance of our business segments using a measure we call segment profit 
segment profit excludes income taxes  interest expense  discontinued operations  indirect interest income and certain other items that are included in net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management believes these are useful financial measures  however  they should not be construed as being more important than other comparable gaap measures 
items excluded from segment profit generally result from decisions made by corporate executives 
financing  divestiture and tax structure decisions are generally made by corporate executives 
excluding these items from our business segment performance measure enables us to evaluate business segment operating performance based upon current economic conditions 
amounts in the corporate category below include business activities that are not separately reportable and income from synthetic fuel investments 
amounts in thousands years ended january  net sales and revenues alternative energy real estate total net sales and revenues segment gross profit loss alternative energy real estate total gross profit segment profit loss alternative energy segment real estate corporate expenses interest expense interest income income from synthetic fuel investments income from continuing operations before income taxes alternative energy the alternative energy segment includes the consolidated financial results of one earth and nugen  our other investments in ethanol facilities  the income or loss related to those investments and certain administrative expenses 
one earth began limited production operations late in the second quarter of fiscal year and became fully operational during the third quarter of fiscal year effective november   we obtained a controlling financial interest in nugen 
thus  we began consolidating the results of nugen prospectively as of the acquisition date 
prior to november   we used the equity method of accounting to account for the results of nugen 
effective january   we sold a portion of our ownership interest in levelland hockley 
as a result  we no longer have a controlling financial interest in levelland hockley  and therefore  we deconsolidated levelland hockley effective january  the results of levelland hockley are consolidated in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows during fiscal years and the assets  liabilities and equity of levelland hockley are deconsolidated in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of january  and the following table summarizes sales from one earth  nugen and levelland hockley  by product group during periods of consolidation amounts in thousands years ended january  ethanol dried distillers grains other total the following table summarizes selected operating data from one earth  nugen and levelland hockley during periods of consolidation years ended january  average selling price per gallon of ethanol average selling price per ton of dried distillers grains average cost per bushel of grain average cost of natural gas per mmbtu net sales and revenue for the current year increased approximately million over the prior year to approximately million  primarily as a result of increases in ethanol and dried distillers grains prices during the current year and the consolidation of nugen s results effective november   which was partially offset by including the results of levelland hockley in the prior year 
ethanol sales increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in the current year 
the average selling price per gallon of ethanol increased from in the prior year to in the current year 
our ethanol sales were based upon approximately million gallons in the current year compared to approximately million gallons in the prior year 
dried distillers grains sales increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in the current year 
the average selling price per ton of dried distillers grains increased from in the prior year to in the current year 
our dried distillers grains sales were based upon approximately  tons in the current year compared to approximately  tons in the prior year 
we expect that sales in future periods will be based upon the following one earth and nugen only product annual sales quantity ethanol million to million gallons dried distillers grains  to  tons corn oil million to million pounds this expectation assumes that one earth and nugen will continue to operate at or near nameplate capacity  which is dependent upon the crush spread realized 
this expectation also assumes that we will not consolidate any other ethanol plants 
gross profit from alternative energy segment sales was approximately million during the current year compared to approximately million during the prior year 
gross profit improved primarily because of the prior year results including those of levelland hockley which produced at approximately of capacity  and  thus was very inefficient with respect to gross profit 
grain accounted for approximately million of our cost of sales during the current year compared to million during the prior year 
natural gas accounted for approximately million of our cost of sales during the current year compared to million during the prior year 
given the inherent volatility in ethanol and grain prices  we cannot predict the trend of the spread between ethanol and grain prices in future periods compared to historical periods 
we attempt to match quantities of ethanol and distillers grains sale contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed 
however  the market for future ethanol sales contracts is not a mature market 
consequently  we generally execute contracts for no more than three months into the future at any given time 
as a result of the relatively short period of time our contracts cover  we generally cannot predict the future movements in the crush spread for more than three months 
less than of our forecasted ethanol sales and approximately of our forecasted distillers grains sales during the next months has been sold under fixed price contracts 
as a result of these positions  the effect of a adverse change in the price of ethanol and distillers grains from the current pricing would result in a decrease in revenues of approximately million and million  respectively 
similarly  approximately of our estimated corn usage for the next months was subject to fixed price contracts 
as a result of these positions  the effect of a adverse change in the price of corn from current pricing would result in an increase in cost of sales of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  a million increase from approximately million in fiscal year a majority of the increase results from higher incentive compensation expense related to higher segment profitability during the current fiscal year 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in future years to increase by approximately million to million over the current year level as future results will include a full year of consolidated results of nugen 
income from equity method investments in big river  patriot and nugen increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in the current year 
we recognized approximately million of income from big river in fiscal year which is approximately million above the prior year amount of approximately million 
big river benefited in the current year from increases in by product pricing and patronage dividends 
we recognized approximately million of income from patriot in fiscal year  which is consistent with the approximately million in the prior year 
we recognized approximately million of income from nugen in fiscal year  which is approximately million higher than the approximately million in the prior year 
the increase results primarily from increased crush spreads realized and recognizing ten months of equity method income from nugen in fiscal year versus six months of equity method income from nugen in fiscal year as we consolidate the results of nugen effective november   we will not recognize income under the equity method for the results of nugen in future periods 
given the inherent volatility in the factors that affect the crush spread  we cannot predict the likelihood that the trend with respect to income from equity method investments will continue in future periods 
during fiscal year  we recognized losses totaling approximately million related to the impairment and deconsolidation of levelland hockley 
effective january   we sold a portion of our equity interest in levelland hockley 
as a result  we no longer have a controlling financial interest in levelland hockley  and  therefore  effective january   we deconsolidated levelland hockley and recorded our retained investment in levelland hockley at fair value as of january  we recognized an impairment loss on our note receivable of approximately million during fiscal year we also recognized a loss on deconsolidation of approximately million during fiscal year on november   we acquired of the outstanding membership units of nugen  which resulted in us owning approximately of the outstanding membership units in nugen 
we applied acquisition accounting for this business combination achieved in stages  and recognized a loss of approximately million by remeasuring the fair value of our equity method investment at the acquisition date and a bargain purchase gain of approximately million related to the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed exceeding our consideration given for such net assets 
interest expense decreased approximately million in the current year from the prior year to approximately million  as we no longer consolidate levelland hockley 
based on current interest rates and debt levels  we expect interest expense to be in the range of million to million in fiscal year other income increased to approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year income recognized by nugen related to dividends paid by a co operative during the current year is the primary reason for the increase 
we do not expect other income to be significant in future periods 
losses on derivative financial instruments held by one earth were approximately million in the current year compared to approximately million in the prior year 
since the gains or losses on these derivative financial instruments are primarily a function of the movement in interest rates  we cannot predict the likelihood that such gains or losses in future periods will be consistent with current year results 
as a result of the factors discussed above  segment profit increased to million in the current year from million in the prior year 
real estate the real estate segment includes all owned and sub leased real estate including those previously used as retail store and distribution center operations  our real estate leasing activities and certain administrative expenses 
it excludes results from discontinued operations 
at january   we had lease agreements  as landlord  for six owned former retail stores  square feet 
we have owned former retail stores  square feet that are vacant at january  we are marketing these vacant properties to lease or sell 
in addition  one former distribution center is partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
net sales and revenue for the current year increased approximately million over the prior year to approximately million 
the increase in revenue is primarily a result of a lease for a portion of a distribution center that was executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross loss from this segment was approximately million during the current year compared to approximately million during the prior year 
gross loss increased primarily as a result of impairment charges of approximately million in the current year compared to approximately million in the prior year 
we expect lease revenue in fiscal year to be consistent with fiscal year based upon leases currently executed 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  consistent with the million in fiscal year we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in future periods to remain consistent with comparable historical periods 
as a result of the factors discussed above  segment loss was approximately million in the current year compared to approximately million in the prior year 
excluding any property sales that may occur in fiscal year  we expect to generate another segment loss in fiscal year based upon the current number of vacant properties 
corporate and other corporate and other includes certain administrative expenses of the corporate headquarters  interest expense and interest income not directly allocated to the alternative energy or real estate segments and income from synthetic fuel investments 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in the current year consistent with the approximately million of expenses in the prior year 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in future periods to be consistent with current year levels 
interest expense of approximately million in the current year is consistent with prior year expense 
interest income of approximately million in the current year is consistent with prior year income 
comparison of fiscal years ended january  and net sales and revenue net sales and revenue in fiscal year were approximately million  a million increase from approximately million in fiscal year net sales and revenue do not include sales from retail and real estate operations classified in discontinued operations 
the increase was primarily caused by higher sales in our alternative energy segment of approximately million and a full year of production at our one earth facility 
net sales and revenue from our real estate segment increased approximately million over the prior year to approximately million 
gross profit gross profit was approximately million in fiscal year versus approximately million for fiscal year this represents an increase of approximately million 
gross profit for fiscal year increased by approximately million over the prior year as a result of operations in the alternative energy segment 
our real estate segment had gross loss for fiscal year of approximately million compared to approximately million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were approximately million of net sales and revenue  an increase of approximately million or from approximately million of net sales and revenue for fiscal year compared to the prior year  these expenses increased approximately million and million in the alternative energy segment and the corporate and other category  respectively 
equity in income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates during fiscal years and  we recognized income of approximately million and approximately million  respectively from our equity investments in big river  patriot and nugen 
big river has a plant with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons which has been in operation since big river opened an additional plant with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons during the second quarter of fiscal year and acquired a ownership in a plant with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons in august patriot has an ethanol facility with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons which has been in operation since the second quarter of fiscal year effective july   we acquired a equity interest in nugen which operates an ethanol production facility in marion south dakota  with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons 
income from big river was approximately million and approximately million in fiscal years and  respectively 
although our proportionate share of income from big river has been consistent over the prior two years  big river benefited in fiscal year from a full year of production at its big river galva and big river united energy facilities 
we recorded income of approximately million and approximately million from patriot in fiscal years and  respectively 
patriot experienced a decline in interest expense of approximately million  as its term debt is variable rate debt  and interest rates declined in fiscal year patriot also recognized a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
we recognized approximately million of income from nugen in fiscal year this was the first year we reported income from nugen given that the acquisition of our interest in nugen was effective july  impairment charges and loss on deconsolidation during fiscal year  we recognized losses totaling approximately million related to the impairment of notes receivable from levelland hockley and the deconsolidation of levelland hockley 
effective january   we sold a portion of our equity interest in levelland hockley 
as a result we no longer have a controlling financial interest in levelland hockley  and  therefore  effective january   we deconsolidated levelland hockley and recorded our retained investment in levelland hockley at fair value as of january  we recognized an impairment loss related to the notes receivable of approximately million during fiscal year we also recognized a loss on deconsolidation of approximately million during fiscal year interest income interest income of approximately million for fiscal year was consistent with the prior year 
interest expense interest expense increased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the alternative energy segment as we had higher amounts of average debt outstanding upon the completion of one earth s ethanol plant and that we are no longer capitalizing interest costs 
loss on early termination of debt during fiscal years and  we completed the early payoff of approximately million and million  respectively  of mortgage debt prior to maturity 
as a result  we expensed certain unamortized financing costs and prepayment penalties of approximately  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
other income during fiscal year  levelland hockley received notification from the united states department of agriculture that levelland hockley had been approved to receive funds under the advanced biofuel producer program 
as a result  approximately million was recognized as other income during fiscal year we recognized approximately million of other income from this grant during fiscal year during fiscal year  levelland hockley entered into an agreement to settle litigation and received million as a condition of the settlement 
of the proceeds received  approximately million was recognized as other income during fiscal year losses on derivative financial instruments we recognized losses of approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  related to forward interest rate swaps that levelland hockley and one earth entered into during fiscal year during fiscal year  levelland hockley s loss was insignificant and one earth s loss was approximately million 
levelland hockley s swap expired in april while one earth s swaps expire in july and july since the gains or losses on these derivative financial instruments are primarily a function of the movement in interest rates  we cannot predict the likelihood that such gains or losses in future periods will be consistent with fiscal year results 
income taxes our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
our effective tax rate is impacted by the noncontrolling interests of the companies we consolidate  as we recognize of their income or loss in continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 
however  we only provide an income tax provision for our portion of subsidiaries income or loss with a noncontrolling interest 
loss income from continuing operations as a result of the foregoing  income from continuing operations was approximately million for fiscal year versus approximately million for fiscal year discontinued operations during fiscal year  we closed our remaining retail store and warehouse operations and reclassified them as discontinued operations 
as a result of these closings and certain other retail store and real estate property closings from prior years  we had income from discontinued operations  net of tax benefit  of approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year we sold ten properties classified as discontinued operations in fiscal year compared to selling or disposing of five properties in fiscal year as a result  we had a gain from disposal of discontinued operations  net of a tax provision  of approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year noncontrolling interests income or loss related to noncontrolling interests was approximately million and approximately million for fiscal years and  respectively  and represents the owners other than us share of the income or loss of levelland hockley and one earth 
noncontrolling interests of levelland hockley and one earth was approximately million and approximately million  respectively during fiscal year and approximately million and approximately million  respectively during fiscal year net loss income attributable to rex common shareholders as a result of the foregoing  net income attributable to rex common shareholders was approximately million for fiscal year compared to approximately million for fiscal year in addition to the information discussed above  the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our business segments and corporate and other 
alternative energy the alternative energy segment includes the consolidated financial statements of levelland hockley and one earth  our other investments in ethanol facilities  the income related to those investments and certain administrative expenses 
one earth began limited production operations late in the second quarter of fiscal year and became fully operational during the third quarter of fiscal year the following table summarizes sales from levelland hockley and one earth by product group amounts in thousands years ended january  ethanol dried distillers grains other total the following table summarizes selected operating data from levelland hockley and one earth years ended january  average selling price per gallon of ethanol average selling price per ton of dried distillers grains average cost per bushel of grain average cost of natural gas per mmbtu net sales and revenue for fiscal year increased by approximately million over the prior year to approximately million  primarily a result of one earth becoming fully operational during the third quarter of fiscal year ethanol sales increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in the current year 
the average selling price per gallon of ethanol increased from in the prior year to in fiscal year our ethanol sales were based upon approximately million gallons in fiscal year compared to approximately million gallons in the prior year 
dried distillers grains sales increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in fiscal year the average selling price per ton of dried distillers grains increased from in the prior year to in fiscal year our dried distillers grains sales were based upon approximately  tons in fiscal year compared to approximately  tons in the prior year 
gross profit from these sales was approximately million during fiscal year compared to approximately million during fiscal year gross profit improved primarily because of the volume increases in ethanol and distillers grains sold discussed above 
this was offset slightly by a less favorable spread between ethanol and grain prices during fiscal year compared to fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  a million increase from approximately million in fiscal year we recognized higher selling expenses of approximately million at one earth as one earth was in production for the full year in fiscal year during fiscal year  we recognized losses totaling approximately million related to the impairment of notes receivable from levelland hockley and the deconsolidation of levelland hockley 
effective january   we sold a portion of our equity interest in levelland hockley 
as a result we no longer have a controlling financial interest in levelland hockley  and  therefore  effective january   we deconsolidated levelland hockley and recorded our retained investment in levelland hockley at fair value as of january  we recognized an impairment loss related to the notes receivable of approximately million during fiscal year we also recognized a loss on deconsolidation of approximately million during fiscal year interest expense increased approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year to approximately million  as we no longer capitalize interest on the one earth credit facility subsequent to the commencement of operations at the plant 
income from equity method investments in big river  patriot and nugen increased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year we recognized approximately million of income from our investment in big river in fiscal year which is approximately million above the prior year amount of approximately million 
big river benefited in the current year from a full year of production at its big river galva and big river united energy facilities during fiscal year we recognized approximately million of income from our investment in patriot in fiscal year  which is approximately million higher than the approximately million in fiscal year patriot experienced a decline in interest expense of approximately million  as its term debt is variable rate debt  and interest rates declined in fiscal year patriot also recognized a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
we recognized approximately million of income from nugen in fiscal year this was the first year we reported income from nugen given that the acquisition of our interest in nugen was effective july  losses on derivative financial instruments held by one earth and levelland were approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year since the gains or losses on the derivative financial instruments are primarily a function of the movement in interest rates  we cannot predict the likelihood that such gains or losses in future periods will be consistent with the fiscal year results 
as a result of the factors discussed above  segment profit decreased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year real estate the real estate segment includes all owned and sub leased real estate including those previously used as retail store and distribution center operations  our real estate leasing activities and certain administrative expenses 
it excludes results from discontinued operations 
at january   we had lease agreements  as landlord  for all or parts of eight former retail stores  square feet leased and  square feet vacant 
we have owned former retail stores  square feet  that are vacant at january  we are marketing these vacant properties to lease or sell 
in addition  one former distribution center is partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
net sales and revenue for fiscal year of approximately million increased approximately million over the fiscal year amount of approximately million 
the increase in revenue is primarily a result of a lease for a portion of a distribution center that was executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross loss from this segment was approximately million during fiscal year compared to approximately million during fiscal year gross loss improved as a result of the increase in revenue discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately  in fiscal year  consistent with the  in fiscal year as a result of the factors discussed above  segment loss was approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in the prior year 
corporate and other selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year professional fees increased approximately million over the prior year 
the remainder of the fluctuation results from increases in most general and administrative categories 
interest expense of approximately million in fiscal year is consistent with the expense in the prior year 
interest income of approximately million in fiscal year is consistent with the income in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of financing have been income from operations  sales of real estate and debt financing 
our primary uses of cash have been investments in ethanol entities  construction of ethanol plants  long term debt repayments and stock repurchases 
outlook our cash balance of approximately million includes approximately million held by one earth and nugen 
pursuant to their debt agreements  one earth and nugen are limited with respect to paying dividends 
thus  we expect that one earth and nugen will use a majority of their cash for working capital and debt service needs 
all of our ethanol investments have significant amounts of long term debt and we expect these organizations to limit the payment of dividends based upon working capital needs  debt service requirements and the requirements of their respective loan agreements 
debt service payments in excess of scheduled amounts related to ethanol debt is the result of excess cash sweeps that are required pursuant to the respective ethanol plant s debt agreement and are based upon percentages of profitability 
we continue to investigate investment opportunities in various companies and industries 
another possible use of our excess cash is to repurchase our common stock 
we typically repurchase our common stock when our stock price is trading at prices we deem to be a discount to the underlying value of our net assets 
historically  we have not incurred additional borrowings to fund repurchases of our common stock 
we also plan to seek and evaluate other various investment opportunities including energy related  agricultural or other ventures we believe fit our investment criteria 
we can make no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to find such opportunities 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we expect our financial performance from our ethanol plants to decline compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year as the crush spread has decreased from levels 
the near month crush spread determined by information on cbot averaged approximately per gallon of ethanol during the first quarter of fiscal year compared to approximately per gallon of ethanol during calendar year operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year during fiscal year  operating cash flow was provided by net income of approximately million including real estate impairment charges of approximately million and other adjustments to net income of approximately million  which consist of depreciation and amortization  income from equity method ethanol investments  bargain purchase gain  net  income from synthetic fuel investments  derivative financial instruments  gain on disposal of real estate and property and equipment  deferred income and the deferred income tax provision

additionally  cash was provided by a refund on income taxes of approximately million resulting from net operating losses carried back to prior years 
accounts receivable decreased approximately million  primarily a result of the timing of products shipped and the receipt of customer payments at one earth and nugen 
other liabilities increased approximately million  primarily a result of increased accrued incentive compensation expenses associated with the increase in profitability in the current year and an increase in accrued natural gas taxes 
prepaid expenses and other assets decreased approximately million  primarily as a result of decreases in deferred commission expense related to extended warranty plans sold when we operated our former retail segment 
inventory increased approximately million  primarily a result of one earth utilizing additional grain storage facilities for which construction was completed in fiscal year and an increase in grain prices over fiscal year accounts payable increased approximately million  primarily a result of inventory receipts and timing of vendor payments 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for fiscal year during fiscal year  operating cash flow was provided by net income of approximately million including the impact of levelland hockley related impairment charges and the loss on deconsolidation of approximately million  real estate impairment charges of approximately million and non cash items of approximately million  which consist of deferred income  the deferred income tax provision  gain on disposal of real estate and property and equipment  income from ethanol investments  and depreciation and amortization 
cash was provided by dividends received from our equity method investees as returns on investment of approximately million  primarily a result of increased profitability at these entities 
additionally  cash was provided by a refund on income taxes of approximately million resulting from net operating losses carried back to prior years 
accounts receivable increased approximately million  primarily a result of the timing of products shipped and the receipt of customer payments at one earth 
prepaid expense and other assets increased approximately million  primarily as a result of an increase in property taxes receivable that one earth pays and then receives a partial rebate from various taxing authorities in connection with a tax increment financing district 
other liabilities decreased approximately million  primarily a result of payments we made related to our contingent consideration liability associated with the nugen acquisition 
other long term assets increased approximately million  primarily a result of an increase in property taxes receivable that one earth pays and then receives a partial rebate from various taxing authorities in connection with a tax increment financing district and an increase in various deposits one earth is required to maintain with utility vendors 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million during fiscal year compared to cash used of approximately million for fiscal year capital expenditures in fiscal year totaled approximately million  the majority of which was for the construction of corn oil extraction equipment at the one earth and nugen ethanol plants 
we received approximately million as a final payment on the sale in a prior year of our interest in a synthetic fuel partnership 
we will not receive additional payments in future periods related to this sale 
we used cash of approximately million for the purchase of an additional ownership interest in patriot 
the acquisition of nugen provided cash of approximately million which was primarily a result of nugen s cash position at the time we acquired nugen exceeding the cash we paid as consideration 
cash of approximately million was provided by proceeds from the sale of real estate and property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million during fiscal year capital expenditures in fiscal year totaled approximately million  the majority of which was for the construction of additional corn storage at one earth s ethanol plant

during fiscal year  we paid off approximately million of long term mortgage debt from scheduled repayments and early payoffs 
during fiscal year  we paid off approximately million of long term debt from scheduled repayments and early payoffs 
one earth subsidiary level debt in september  one earth entered into a  financing agreement consisting of a construction loan agreement for  together with a  revolving loan and a  letter of credit with first national bank of omaha

one earth has no outstanding borrowings on the  revolving loan as of january  one earth also has access to a secondary revolving loan with first national bank of omaha  established as part of the original  term loan and made accessible as a revolving loan as term loan payments were made 
the amount available is reduced by  on a quarterly basis as well as by of excess cash flow calculated at year end pursuant to the debt covenant calculations of the loan agreement 
at january  and  one earth had  and  respectively  available on the secondary revolving loan

tabular disclosure of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements under which we are obligated to make legally enforceable future cash payments 
these agreements include obligations related to purchasing inventory  long term debt and interest rate management 
the following table summarizes by category expected future cash outflows associated with contractual obligations in effect as of january  amounts in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest on variable rate debt a interest on fixed rate debt other b total c a the interest rates effective as of january  for variable rate loans were used to calculate future payments of interest on variable rate debt 
b amounts represent primarily payments due for rail car usage contracts at one earth energy and nugen 
c we are not able to determine the likely settlement period for uncertain tax positions  accordingly  approximately million of uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties have been excluded from the table above 
we are not able to determine the likely settlement period  if any  for interest rate swaps  accordingly approximately million of liabilities for derivative financial instruments have been excluded from the table above 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the impact of seasonal and quarterly fluctuations has not been material to our results of operations for the past three fiscal years 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation has not been material to our results of operations for the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies we believe the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  require significant assumptions  judgments and estimates on the part of management 
we base our assumptions  judgments  and estimates on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
further  if different assumptions  judgments and estimates had been used  the results could have been different and such differences could be material 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize sales from ethanol and distillers grains when title transfers to customers  upon shipment from our plant 
shipping and handling charges to ethanol and distillers grains customers are included in net sales and revenue 
we include income from our real estate leasing activities in net sales and revenue 
we account for these leases as operating leases 
accordingly  minimum rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
we sold retail product service contracts covering periods beyond the normal manufacturers warranty periods  usually with terms of coverage including manufacturers warranty periods of between to months 
contract revenues and sales commissions are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the contracts after the expiration of applicable manufacturers warranty periods 
we retain the obligation to perform warranty service and such costs are charged to operations as incurred 
all related revenue and expense is classified in discontinued operations 
we recognized income from synthetic fuel partnership sales as the synthetic fuel was produced and sold except for operations at the gillette facility as we did not believe that collection of our proceeds for production occurring subsequent to september  was reasonably assured from that plant until the third quarter of fiscal year see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of synthetic fuel partnership sales 
investments the method of accounting applied to long term investments  whether consolidated  equity or cost  involves an evaluation of the significant terms of each investment that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee and also includes the identification of any variable interests in which we are the primary beneficiary 
the evaluation of consolidation under asc consolidation is complex and requires judgments to be made 
we consolidated the results of two majority owned subsidiaries  levelland hockley and one earth  on a one month lag during fiscal year as a result of losing control of levelland hockley at the end of fiscal year  we deconsolidated the subsidiary s balance sheet and applied the equity method of accounting prospectively 
however  during fiscal year  levelland hockley filed for bankruptcy  at which time we began using the cost method to account for our investment in levelland hockley 
beginning november   we also consolidated the results of nugen as that was the date we obtained a controlling financial interest in nugen 
investments in businesses that we do not control  or maintain a majority voting interest or maintain a primary beneficial interest  but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial matters  are accounted for using the equity method 
investments in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial matters are accounted for using the cost method 
we periodically evaluate our investments for impairment due to declines in market value considered to be other than temporary 
such impairment evaluations include  in addition to persistent  declining market prices  general economic and company specific evaluations 
if we determine that a decline in market value is other than temporary  then a charge to earnings is recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all or a portion of the unrealized loss  and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
inventory inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
the market value of inventory is often dependent upon fluctuating commodity prices 
if these estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to market conditions that require an additional reduction in the value of certain inventories affected 
we provide for a permanent write down of inventory  for inventory items that have a cost greater than net realizable value 
the write down of inventory was approximately  at january  no write down of inventory was recorded at january  fluctuations in the write down of inventory generally relate to the levels and composition of such inventory at a given point in time 
the assumptions we currently use include our estimates of the selling prices of ethanol and distillers grains 
financial instruments forward grain purchase and ethanol and distillers grains sales contracts are accounted for under the normal purchases and normal sales scope exemption of asc  derivatives and hedging asc because these arrangements are for purchases of grain and sales of ethanol and distillers grains that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used by us over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage our balance of fixed and variable rate debt 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties 
our swap agreement was not designated for hedge accounting pursuant to asc the interest rate swap is recorded at fair value and the change in fair value is recorded as gain or loss on derivative financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the most significant factor that impacts the fair value calculation is the estimate of future interest rates over the remaining life of the swap agreement 
changes to the estimate could impact the fair value calculation materially 
accounting for business combinations in accounting for business combinations  we apply the accounting requirements of asc  business combinations  asc  which requires the recording of net assets of acquired businesses at fair value 
in developing estimates of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities  we analyze a variety of factors including market data  estimated future cash flows of the acquired operations  industry growth rates and assumptions for certain future commodity prices 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the future commodity prices 
in determining the fair value of the company s assets associated with the purchase of nugen  we utilized two valuation methods market approach this method estimates fair value based on market prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for assets currently available for sale 
this valuation process is essentially that of comparison and correlation between other similar assets and those of nugen 
income approach this method estimates fair value based upon the present value of cash flows we expect to generate from nugen s operations over nugen s remaining useful life 
we used the discounted cash flow method 
changes to the assumptions we used to estimate fair value could impact the recorded amounts for acquired assets and liabilities  including property  plant and equipment 
significant changes to these balances could have a material impact on our future reported results 
income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes  net of valuation allowances 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing regulatory tax laws and rates and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
we have established valuation allowances for certain state net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
we determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to allow for the full utilization of the federal amt credit carryforward and other deferred tax assets other than those reserved 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  we have assumed that our ethanol plants and real estate assets will continue to generate taxable income 
we are projecting that the operations of one earth and nugen will continue to be profitable 
we are assuming that we will be relatively successful in our real estate marketing efforts 
in addition  we have considered the fact that our amt credit carryforward has an indefinite life 
in general  we have used approximately million as the assumed average of future years pre tax income 
we believe our assumed target level of earnings is reasonable based upon historical experience and expectations of real estate rental income and ethanol plant operating income 
in addition  we considered other positive factors in our assessment 
although during fiscal years  and we realized a taxable loss  we generated taxable income in fiscal year through our ethanol and real estate operations 
furthermore  the taxable loss is attributable  in large part  to accelerated depreciation deductions for income tax purposes 
such deductions are not expected to continue at levels we have seen in the last three years as evidenced by the net deferred tax liability of approximately million recorded at january  in addition  we have significant financial resources to deploy in future income producing activities 
the valuation allowance was approximately million and approximately million at january  and january   respectively 
should estimates of future income differ significantly from our prior estimates  we could be required to make a material change to our deferred tax valuation allowance 
the primary assumption used to estimate the valuation allowance has been estimates of future state taxable income 
such estimates can have material variations from year to year based upon expected levels of income from our ethanol plants  leasing income and gains on real estate sales 
factors that could negatively affect future taxable income include adverse changes in the commercial real estate market and the ethanol crush spread 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
as of january   total unrecognized tax benefits were approximately million  and accrued penalties and interest were approximately million 
if we were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded  approximately million of the reserve would benefit the effective tax rate 
in addition  the impact of penalties and interest would also benefit the effective tax rate 
interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are recorded within income tax expense 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit with respect to certain unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease during the next months  however  we do not expect the change to have a material effect on results of operations or financial position 
on a quarterly and annual basis  we accrue for the effects of open uncertain tax positions and the related potential penalties and interest 
should future estimates of open uncertain tax positions differ from our current estimates  we could be required to make a material change to our accrual for uncertain tax positions 
in addition  new income tax audit findings could also require us to make a material change to our accrual for uncertain tax positions 
recoverability of long lived assets given the nature of our business  each income producing property must be evaluated separately when events and circumstances indicate that the value of that asset may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
we generally use expected future cash flows on a discounted basis and appraisals of specific properties to estimate fair value 
changes in the real estate market for particular locations could result in changes to our estimates of the property s value upon disposal 
in addition  changes in expected future cash flows from our ethanol plants could result in additional impairment charges

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with interest rates and commodity prices as discussed below 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
exposure to interest rate risk results primarily from holding term and revolving loans that bear variable interest rates 
specifically  we have approximately million in variable rate debt as of january  interest rates on our variable rate debt are determined based upon the market interest rate of libor plus to basis points 
a adverse change for example from to in market interest rates would increase our interest cost on such debt by approximately million per year in the aggregate 
however  this change would be greater should libor rates exceed  which is the floor interest rate of the nugen subsidiary level long term debt 
one earth entered into two forward interest rate swaps in the notional amounts of million and million with the first national bank of omaha during fiscal years and the million swap fixed the variable interest rate of a portion of one earth s term loan at  while the million swap fixed the variable interest rate of a portion of one earth s term loan at 
the swap settlements commenced on july   the million swap terminates on july  and the million swap terminated on july  a hypothetical change for example  from to in market interest rates at january  would change the fair value of the interest rate swap by approximately million 
commodity price risk we manage a portion of our risk with respect to the volatility of commodity prices inherent in the ethanol industry by using forward purchase and sale contracts 
at january   one earth and nugen combined have purchase commitments for approximately million bushels of corn  the principal raw material for their ethanol plants 
one earth and nugen expect to take delivery of the corn by july one earth and nugen have combined sales commitments for approximately million gallons of ethanol and  tons of distillers grains 
one earth and nugen expect to deliver the ethanol and distillers grains by april less than of our forecasted ethanol sales during the next months have been sold under fixed price contracts 
as a result  the effect of a adverse move in the price of ethanol from the current pricing would result in a decrease in annual revenues of approximately million for the remaining forecasted ethanol sales 
approximately of our forecasted distillers grains sales during the next months have been sold under fixed price contracts 
as a result  the effect of a adverse move in the price of distillers grains from the current pricing would result in a decrease in annual revenues of approximately million for the remaining of forecasted distillers grains sales 
similarly  approximately of our estimated corn usage for the next month was subject to fixed price contracts 
as a result  the effect of a adverse move in the price of corn for current pricing would result in an increase in annual cost of goods sold of approximately million for the remaining of forecasted corn usage
