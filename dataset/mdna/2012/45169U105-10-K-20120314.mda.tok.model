we use the terms igate  we  the company  our and us in this report to refer to igate corporation and its subsidiaries 
all references to years  unless otherwise noted  refer to our fiscal year  which ends as of december for example  a reference to fiscal means the month period that ended as of december  all references to quarters  unless otherwise noted  refer to the quarters of our fiscal year 
we use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of business performance

this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
overview igate corporation igate or the company is a leading provider of it and it enabled operations offshore outsourcing solutions services to large and medium size organizations 
igate provides end to end business solutions that leverage technology  thus enabling its clients to enhance business performance 
on may   we completed the acquisition of a majority stake in patni computer systems limited the patni acquisition 
patni is a company incorporated in india under the indian companies act  patni is engaged in it consulting  software development and bpo 
it provides multiple service offerings to its clients across various industries including banking and insurance  manufacturing  retail and distribution  life sciences  product engineering  and communications  media and entertainment and utilities 
patni s various service offerings include application development and maintenance  enterprise software and systems integration services  business and technology consulting  product engineering services  infrastructure management services  customer interaction services and bpo  quality assurance and engineering services 
the patni acquisition was valued at billion 

table of contents industry background the rise of global service providers has enabled companies to reduce costs and improve productivity 
this growth has been driven by numerous factors  including the broad adoption of global communications  increased competition from globalization  and the organization and availability of highly trained offshore workforces 
while many of the initial global providers focused on it services  numerous other players have arisen to offer business services as well  including bpo 
it and business services are typically managed as separate offerings by service providers 
the two offerings have very different workflows and infrastructure requirements 
additionally  whereas it services require highly trained professionals  many offshore business services  such as bpo  generally require only graduates with foreign language skills 
as a result  many large service providers  who offer both it and business services  manage them through separate internal organizations 
many clients have also separated these functions 
unfortunately  this separation often results in competing interests between it and business operations 
as global services has become mainstream  many clients are now seeking tighter integration of their it and business processes to maintain differentiation and cost effectiveness 
additionally  as most bpo services depend upon client technology and infrastructure  many bpo clients are seeking to outsource their it services as well 
we believe that this demand will require global service providers to offer converged it and business solutions 
we believe that those providers who are experts in their clients it and businesses processes and who can best deliver converged services using a combination of onsite and offshore professionals will most benefit from these industry trends 
economic trends and outlook according to gartner inc  an it research and advisory company  the it services industry worldwide it spending is forecasted to total billion in  a increase from revenue of nearly billion 
if the global economic recovery continues  modest growth in it spending is expected 
however  the potential for event driven disruptions such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan  or general global economic slowdowns would likely have an adverse impact on it spending 
the it industry is aggressively pursuing innovations that it expects to stimulate demand beyond such modest growth 
besides organic growth  it service providers are also aggressively pursuing mergers and acquisitions to stimulate growth 
we believe that our business model is diversified  both geographically and operationally we serve both it and it enabled solutions 
we believe our strategy of a global delivery model and the patni acquisition positions us well to provide a greater breadth of services in catering to market needs and opportunities 
recent events impacting future operations proposed acquisition of balance stake of patni and delisting from the stock exchanges if the delisting is successful and all the shares of common stock are tendered  igate s beneficial ownership in patni is expected to increase from approximately to 
upon the delisting being successful  public trading of the patni shares of common stock on the bse and the nse and adss on the nyse will cease 
the promoters also will seek to cause the common stock of patni to be deregistered under the exchange act 
as the sole shareholder of patni  igate will receive the benefit of the right to participate in any and all future increases in patni s value and will bear the complete risk of any and all losses incurred in the operation of patni and any decreases in patni s value 
upon completion of the delisting  patni s public shareholders who tender their shares of common stock will not bear the risks of potential decreases in the value of their holdings in patni based on any downturns in patni s future performance 
under the delisting  patni s public shareholders will receive a single cash price for their shares of common stock including those represented by adss which are converted into common stock

critical accounting policies and estimates the following explains our most critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth on pages to of this form k for a complete description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of a contractual arrangement with customers  services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company has concluded that it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement when it enters into an agreement with its clients with terms and conditions which describe the services and the related payments are legally enforceable 
when the terms of the agreement specify service level parameters that must be met  the company monitors such service level parameters and determines if there are any service credits or penalties which need to be accounted for 
revenue is recognized net of any service credits that are due to a client and net of applicable taxes and includes reimbursements of out of pocket expenses  with the corresponding cost for out of pocket expenses included in cost of revenue 
it services are provided either on a fixed price  fixed time frame or on a time and material basis 
revenue with respect to time and material contracts is recognized as the related services are performed 
time and material contracts typically bill at an agreed upon hourly or daily rate 
the company s fixed price contracts include application maintenance and support services  on which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of maintenance 
revenues related to fixed price contracts that provide for highly complex information technology application development services are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method with input cost to cost method while contracts that do not provide for highly complex information technology development services are recognized as the services are performed using proportional performance basis with input efforts expended method 
the company considers the input method the best available measure of progress on these contracts as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity 
costs are recorded as incurred over the contract period 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the current contract estimates 
significant judgment is required to estimate the time and cost to complete the project 
our project delivery personnel continually review the labor hours incurred and the estimated total labor hours  which may result in revisions to the amount of revenue recognized for the contract 
changes in estimates are accounted for in the period 
table of contents of change 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates through approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
goodwill goodwill represents the cost of the acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with asc  intangible assets including goodwill and amortization 
the provisions of asc requires that recoverability of goodwill be evaluated using a two step process 
under the first step  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides is compared with its carrying value of the assets and liabilities including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the step two of the impairment test measurement is performed 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in a business combination 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon the market capitalization adjusted for a control premium and discounted future cash flow analysis 
the discounted future cash flow analysis is based upon a number of estimates and assumptions including operating results and business plans 
the company has applied a control premium of  which was arrived at based on historical acquisition trends of listed companies in india 
the company performs its annual impairment review of goodwill on november  and when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests 
based on the results of its annual impairment tests  the company determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of december   and intangible assets as of december   the definite lived intangible assets were predominantly comprised of customer relationships and intellectual property rights arising from the patni acquisition 
the acquired company is often party to certain customer contracts and relationships that are of material value to an acquirer 
customer contracts and relationships refer to forecast revenues from existing customers from whom there is a readily identifiable income stream as at the valuation date  as a result of established business relationships with them 
we have estimated the fair value of customer contracts and relationships based on the excess earnings method under the income approach 
the excess earnings method is predicated on the basis that the value of an intangible asset is the present value of the earnings it generates  net of a reasonable return on other assets also contributing to that stream of earnings 
the main steps under this method are forecast sales to which the acquired intangibles contribute and estimate the cash flows earned from these sales 
to arrive at the projected revenues from the existing customers  we have considered the revenues of the last years from all the existing customers as at the valuation date and applied an annual average churn rate of rounded to these revenues 
deduct the tax charge on these cash flows we estimated the effective tax rate on a go forward basis to be deduct contributory asset charges in order to assess the excess earnings attributable to customer contracts and relationships  we have deducted contributory asset charges for the use of other assets 
the 
table of contents contributory charges for the economic returns are computed based on the assets utilized by the intangible asset 
the notional contributory charges are based on the presumption that the contributory assets were leased from a third party in an arms length transaction 
all such contributory charges are computed based on the fair value of the relevant contributory asset 
the applied contributory asset charges take into account the return of the asset wear and tear and the return on asset interest on invested capital 
we considered the risk of the above intangible in relation to the risk of other intangibles and in relation to the risk of the overall business 
based on this analysis  we utilized a discount rate of 
we used this to discount the excess earnings to obtain the value of the intangible 
we have assumed an economic life of years considering the uncertainty of continuity of customer relationships beyond this period and also that the present value factor beyond such period is not material 
the estimated useful life of customer relationship and intellectual property rights is years and year to years  respectively 
customer relationships and intellectual property rights are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits consumed in each period ie based on ratio of the undiscounted cashflows for a period to the total estimated undiscounted cashflows 
the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  and known technological advances and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment 
as a global company  we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly 
factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located 
valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 
we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense 
in accordance with fasb guidance on uncertainty in income taxes  a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs 
in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts derivative contracts to mitigate and manage the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on inter company and end customer accounts receivables and forecasted sales and inter company transactions 
the company hedges anticipated sales transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure with derivative contracts that are designated effective and that qualify as cash flow hedges under asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
as part of hedge strategy  the company also enters into derivative contracts which are replaced with successive new contracts up to the period in which the forecasted transaction is expected to occur ie roll over 
table of contents hedges 
in case of rollover hedges  the hedge effectiveness is assessed based on changes in fair value to the extent of changes in spot prices and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged transactions occur and at that time is recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
accordingly  the changes in the fair value of the contract related to the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price ie forward premium discount are excluded from assessment of hedge effectiveness and is recognized in consolidated statements of income and are included in foreign exchange gain loss 
in respect of derivative contracts which hedge the foreign currency risk associated with the both anticipated sales transaction and the collection thereof dual purpose hedges  the hedge effectiveness is assessed based on overall changes in fair value with the effective portion of gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the effective portion of gain or loss attributable to forecasted sales are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss and recognized in consolidated statements of income when the sales transaction occurs 
post the date of sales transaction  the company reclassifies an amount from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to earnings to offset foreign currency translation gain loss recorded for the respective receivable during the period 
in addition  the company determines the amount of cost to be ascribed to each period of the hedging relationship based on the functional currency interest rate implicit in the hedging relationship and recognizes this cost by reclassifying it from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to consolidated statements of income for recognized receivables based on the pro rata method 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges deemed ineffective are recognized in the consolidated statement of income and are included in foreign exchange gain loss 
the company also uses derivatives contracts not designated as hedging instruments under asc no 
to hedge intercompany and end customer accounts receivables and other monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of income and are included in foreign exchange gain loss 
stock based compensation fasb asc topic  accounting for stock based compensation  requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
under this standard  the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock options at grant date based on the historical traded prices of our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other data including life of the option and vesting period 
the risk free interest rate assumption is the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock based awards on a periodic basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 

table of contents use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of property and equipment  carrying amount of property and equipment  intangibles and goodwill  valuation allowance for receivables and deferred tax assets  valuation of derivative instruments  valuation of share based compensation  assets and obligations related to employee benefits  income tax uncertainties and other contingencies and commitments 
management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prudent and reasonable 
although these estimates are based upon management s best knowledge of current events and actions  actual results could differ from these estimates 
presentation of supplemental non gaap financial measures in this management s discussion and analysis  we use supplemental non gaap financial measures as defined by the securities and exchange commission 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with  us gaap and may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies

use of non gaap financial measures effective from the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to use non gaap net income data and non gaap basic and diluted earnings per share 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with  u 
s gaap and may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies 
in addition  these non gaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles 
reconciliations of these non gaap measures to their comparable gaap measures are included in the attached financial tables 
we believe that non gaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with igate s results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate igate s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures 
these non gaap measures should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or be construed as being more important than comparable gaap measures 
we believe that providing adjusted ebitda and non gaap net income and non gaap basic and diluted earnings per share in addition to the related gaap measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by our management in our financial and operational decision making 
these non gaap measures are also used by management in connection with igate s performance compensation programs 
the non gaap financial measures contained herein exclude the following items amortization of intangible assets intangible assets comprise value of our customer relationships from the recent patni acquisition and the previous delisting of igate s indian subsidiary 
we incur charges relating to the amortization of these intangibles 
these charges are included in our gaap presentation of earnings from operations  operating margin  net income and diluted earnings per share 
we exclude these charges for purposes of calculating these non gaap measures 
stock based compensation although stock based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives  determining the fair value of the stock based instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may not reflect the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stock based awards 
furthermore  unlike cash compensation  the value of stock based compensation is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors  such as market volatility  that are beyond our control 
management believes it is useful to exclude stock based compensation in order to better understand the long term performance of our core business

delisting expenses igate is voluntarily delisting the equity shares of its majority owned subsidiary  patni from the national stock exchange of india limited and the bombay stock exchange limited and the american depository shares from the new york stock exchange 
delisting is an infrequent activity and expenses incurred in connection therein are inconsistent in amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of the delisting 
we believe that eliminating these expenses for purposes of calculating these non gaap measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to its past operating performance 
from time to time in the future  there may be other items that we may exclude in presenting our financial results 
the table below presents a reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures for each of the past three years in thousands  except for per share data for the year ended december  net income attributable to igate corporation adjustments amortization of intangible assets  net of taxes share based compensation  net of taxes acquisition expenses delisting expenses forex gain on acquisition hedging and other remeasurement  net of taxes severance cost  net of taxes non gaap net income basic earnings per share from operations gaap non gaap diluted earnings per share from operations gaap non gaap weighted average shares outstanding  basic weighted average dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding includes assumed conversion of million shares of series b preferred stock as of january  includes patni balances since may  non gaap disclosure of adjusted ebitda effective from the second quarter of fiscal  we decided to present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to igate corporation plus i depreciation and amortization  ii interest expense  iii income tax expense  minus iv other income  net plus 
table of contents v foreign exchange gain loss  v stock based compensation vi acquisition expenses vii severance expenses and viii delisting going private expenses 
we eliminated the impact of the above as we do not consider them as indicative of our ongoing operating performance 
these adjustments are itemized below 
you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis 
in evaluating adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda i as a factor in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation  ii to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and iii because our credit agreement and our indenture use measures similar to adjusted ebitda to measure our compliance with certain covenants 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  non cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long term incentive compensation package  although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally

liquidity and capital resources cash from operations our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers for different information technology services we render under various statements of work sows 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  leased facilities and taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal and primarily due to higher net income adjusted for depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation in each of these periods 
these increases in fiscal and were partially offset by certain unfavorable changes in working capital  primarily increases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues resulting from increases in revenues during the fourth quarters of and  respectively  in comparison to the prior years

capital expenditures we expect to spend approximately million for new and existing facility expansion  new hardware and software during we will fund the entire capital expenditures through a combination of available cash reserves and short term investments and expect to fund the costs of future expansion through our net cash flows provided by operations and ads net proceeds at patni 
we and our subsidiaries may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt including publicly issued debt through cash purchases and or exchanges  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  by tender offer or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors

if we do not generate sufficient cash from operations  face unanticipated cash needs such as the need to fund significant strategic acquisitions or do not otherwise have sufficient cash and cash equivalents  we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million as of december   and future cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our future cash requirements described above

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors we are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  especially the indian rupee rupee 
we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity our cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation between the rupee and usd  cad  jpy  euros and gbp 
this foreign currency risk exists based upon the nature of the subsidiary operations namely igate global and patni 
for example  the majority of the revenue that the company derives from patni s operations originates from services provided to two customers in the united states and canada 
this results in an inherent foreign currency risk between usd  cad and rupee exchange rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing rupee rates mainly through financial market transactions 
these transactions may include entering into forward or option contracts to hedge existing exposures 
the instruments are used to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 
the following table presents information related to foreign currency contracts held by the company in thousands as of december  currency amount local currency amount usd us dollar contracts cad contracts jpy contracts euro contracts gbp contracts 
table of contents interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of long term and short term debt 
the nature and amount of the company s long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
effect of hypothetical fluctuation in market prices our primary net foreign currency exposure is the indian rupee 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of the company s outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming hypothetical   and fluctuations in currency rates would be approximately in millions valuation given x decrease in rupee usd rate fair value as of december  valuation given x increase in rupee usd rate rupee to usd rate derivative instruments however  it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 
in relation to currency contracts  this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the usd
