item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the costs and timing of completion of client projects  our ability to collect accounts receivable  the timing and amounts of expected payments associated with cost reduction activities  and the ability to realize our net deferred tax assets  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the fiscal year end dates referenced herein for fiscal years   and are december   january   and december   respectively 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations ics business unit transaction the sale by the company of the ics business unit and eloyalty registered trademark trade name to magellan acquisition sub  llc  a colorado limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of teletech holdings  inc  a delaware corporation  closed on may   and the company changed its name from eloyalty corporation to mattersight corporation effective may  therefore  the results of operations of the ics business unit are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
additionally  certain corporate and general costs that had historically been allocated to the ics business unit were reallocated to the company and are reflected in all periods presented 
revenue recognition continuing operations behavioral analytics revenue behavioral analytics revenue consists of managed services revenue and consulting services revenue 
managed services revenue consists of planning  deployment  training  and subscription fees derived from behavioral analytics contracts 
planning  deployment  and training fees  which are considered to be installation fees related to long term subscription contracts  are deferred until the installation is complete and are then recognized over the term of the applicable subscription contract 
the terms of these subscription contracts generally range from three to five years 
installation costs incurred are deferred up to an amount not to exceed the amount of deferred installation revenue and additional amounts that are recoverable based on the contractual arrangement 
these costs are included in prepaid expenses and other long term assets 
such costs are amortized over the term of the subscription contract 
costs in excess of the foregoing revenue amount are expensed in the period incurred 
the amount of revenue generated from subscription fees is based on a number of factors  such as the number of agents accessing the behavioral analytics system and or the number of hours of calls analyzed during the relevant month of the term of the subscription contract 
this revenue is recognized as the service is performed for the client 
consulting services revenue primarily consists of fees charged to the company s clients to provide post deployment follow on consulting services  which include custom data analysis  the implementation of enhancements  and training 
these follow on consulting services are generally performed for the company s clients on a fixed fee basis 
revenue is recognized as the services are performed  with performance generally assessed on the ratio of actual hours incurred to date compared to the total estimated hours over the entire term of the contract 

table of contents other revenue other revenue consists of marketing managed services revenue and crm services revenue 
marketing managed services revenue is derived from marketing application hosting 
this revenue is generally in the form of fixed monthly fees received from the company s clients and is recognized as the services are performed for each client 
any related setup fee would be recognized over the contract period of the hosting arrangement 
crm services revenue consists of fees generated from the company s operational consulting services  which are provided to the company s clients on a time and materials or fixed fee basis 
the company recognizes revenue as the services are performed for time and materials projects 
for fixed fee projects  revenue is recognized based on the ratio of hours incurred to date compared to the total estimated hours over the entire term of the contract 
reimbursed expenses revenue includes billable costs related to travel and other out of pocket expenses incurred while performing services for our clients 
the cost of third party product and support may be included within this category if the transaction does not satisfy the requirements for gross reporting 
an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in cost of revenue 
payments received for managed services contracts in excess of the amount of revenue recognized for these contracts are recorded as unearned revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the company s estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur  then a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from clients not paying for unpaid or disputed invoices for contractual services provided 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates 
discontinued operations ics business unit managed services revenue included in the ics business unit consisted of fees generated from the company s contact center support and monitoring services 
support and monitoring services generally were contracted for a fixed fee  and the revenue was recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
support fees that were contracted on a time and materials basis were recognized as the services were performed for the client 
for fixed fee managed services contracts  where the company provided support for third party software and hardware  revenue was recorded at the gross amount of the sale 
if the contract did not meet the requirements for gross reporting  then managed services revenue was recorded at the net amount of the sale 
consulting services revenue included in the ics business unit consisted of the modeling  planning  configuring  or integrating of an internet protocol network solution within the company s clients contact center environments 
these services were provided to clients on a time and materials or fixed fee basis 
for the integration of a system  the company recognized revenue as the services were performed  with performance generally assessed on the ratio of hours incurred to date compared to the total estimated hours over the entire term of the contract 
for all other consulting services  the company recognized revenue as the services were performed for the client 
revenue from the sale of product  which was generated primarily from the resale of third party software and hardware by the company  was generally recorded at the gross amount of the sale when it was delivered to the client 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in october  the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to i provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  ii require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices esp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 

table of contents the company elected to adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis 
the adoption of this guidance does not impact our revenue recognition with respect to behavioral analytics because the implementation services sold with our hosting service are not separated into multiple accounting units because there is no standalone fair value for these services 
we recognize these services revenues over the anticipated term of the hosting services  currently the contract term 
this accounting guidance does not change the units of accounting for the company s revenue transactions or the methods used to allocate consideration to the units of accounting 
the revenue recognition for each of these offerings is discussed below 
for the ics business unit  the company utilized vsoe to allocate revenue to various elements in an arrangement 
we determined vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the product or service when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we required that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or consulting services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range  generally evidenced by approximately of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus of the median selling price 
for the ics business unit s managed services  we established vsoe through the stated renewal approach 
previously  we were able to establish vsoe for our product and service offerings except for software 
if we were not able to establish vsoe for an offering  we attempted to establish fair value by utilizing tpe 
tpe is established by obtaining evidence from comparable offerings from a peer company 
if the company was unable to establish fair value using vsoe or tpe  then the company used esp in its allocation of revenue 
to determine esp  we applied significant judgment as we weighed a variety of factors  based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
these factors included internal costs  gross margin objectives  and existing portfolio pricing and discounting 
within discontinued operations  some of our sales arrangements had multiple deliverables containing software and related software components 
such sale arrangements were subject to the accounting guidance in asc  software revenue recognition 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires certain assumptions 
the company uses historical information as the primary basis for the selection of expected life  expected volatility  expected dividend yield assumptions  and anticipated forfeiture rates 
the risk free interest rate is selected based on the yields from us treasury strips with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the options being valued 
goodwill in the fourth quarter of  we early adopted asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which allows an entity to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
as a result  in performing our annual impairment test  we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  including goodwill 
if it is concluded that this is the case  we perform a detailed quantitative assessment 
our annual impairment test of goodwill is performed in the fourth quarter of each year 
in  after completing our annual qualitative review  we concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying value of any of our reporting units exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  we concluded that further quantitative analysis and testing was not required  and no goodwill impairment charge was required 
there has been no impairment identified as a result of the annual review of goodwill as of december  and january  the carrying value of goodwill was million as of december  and january  intangible assets intangible assets reflect costs related to patent and trademark applications  marketing managed services customer relationships acquired in  and the purchase of a license for certain intellectual property 
patent and trademark applications are amortized over months 
the other intangible assets are fully amortized 
the original cost of intangible assets as of december  and january  was million and million  respectively 
accumulated amortization of intangible assets as of december  and january  was million and million  respectively 
currently  amortization expense of intangible assets is expected to be thousand annually 
severance and related costs we recorded accruals for severance and related costs associated with our cost reduction efforts undertaken during fiscal years through the portion of the accruals relating to employee severance represents contractual severance for identified employees and generally is not subject to a significant revision 
the portion of the accruals that related to office space reductions  office closures  and associated contractual lease obligations are based in part on assumptions and estimates of the timing and amount of sublease rentals  which may be affected by overall economic and local market conditions 
to the extent estimates of the success of our sublease efforts changed  adjustments increasing or decreasing the related accruals have been recognized 

table of contents income taxes we have recorded income tax valuation allowances on our net deferred tax assets to account for the unpredictability surrounding the timing of realization of our us and us net deferred tax assets due to uncertain economic conditions 
the valuation allowances may be reversed at a point in time when management determines realization of these tax assets has become more likely than not  based on a return to predictable levels of profitability 
the company uses an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for the year  the basis of assets and liabilities and for tax loss carryforwards 
the company does not provide us deferred income taxes on earnings of us or foreign subsidiaries  which are expected to be indefinitely reinvested 
the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
significant judgment is used to determine the likelihood of the benefit 
there is additional guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure requirements 
intraperiod tax allocation requires that the provision for income taxes be allocated between continuing operations and other categories of earnings such as discontinued operations or other comprehensive income for each tax jurisdiction 
in periods in which there is a year to date pre tax loss from continuing operations and pre tax income in other categories of earnings  the tax provision is first allocated to the other categories of earnings 
a related tax benefit is then recorded in continuing operations 
while intraperiod tax allocation in general does not change the overall tax provision  it may result in a gross up of the individual components  thereby changing the amount of tax provision included in each category 
included in our continuing operations income tax provision is a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended january  included in our discontinued operations income tax provision is tax expense of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended january  other significant accounting policies for a description of the company s other significant accounting policies  see note two summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item of this form k

table of contents business outlook based upon mattersight s business development efforts and third party market research  we believe there has been a fundamental shift in the way large enterprises view data 
the trends suggest that large enterprises today appreciate that there is value in data that can be derived from their front and back offices  but they have not yet established efficient and effective methods to capture  analyze  and create value from this data 
we seek to help large enterprises capitalize on this data with our behavioral analytics solutions and  as the leader in this rapidly growing market  we believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity 
we estimate the market potential in the united states for all of our current analytics offerings at over billion per year 
the market for enterprise analytics is very new and we currently estimate it to be less than penetrated 
our business strategy to increase revenue  profitability  and capture market share includes the following elements increase up sell and cross sell ratios by deepening and broadening our relationships with existing clients  win business with new clients  focusing on analyzing customer interactions and back office activities in targeted industries  continue to invest in innovative proprietary technology  new applications  and delivery methods  continue bookings growth and improve operating leverage  expand our sales and marketing efforts with seasoned enterprise sales agents and strategic marketing professionals  and develop partnerships and strategic alliances to expand sales leverage  improve brand awareness  and reach new industries while providing value to our mutual clients 
resulting from our delivery of measurable economic benefit to our clients  we have seen increasing penetration within existing accounts  due to an increase in adoption of our base behavioral analytics offerings across separate and distinct business units  as well as the adoption of new applications within existing business units 
for this reason  we will continue to focus on further penetrating what we estimate to be a large existing base market with a less expensive cost of acquisition 
in addition  our strategy to further invest in sales and marketing  coinciding with the fundamental shift in enterprise data utilization described above  has led to an increasing number of discussions with potential new clients and strategic partners 
managed services backlog as a result of the strategic and long term nature of managed services revenue  we believe it is appropriate to monitor the level of backlog associated with our managed services agreements 
the behavioral analytics managed services backlog was million as of december  and million as of january  this increase in backlog is due to the value of the managed services contracts signed in fiscal year exceeding the amount of managed services revenue in fiscal year we expect behavioral analytics managed service backlog to increase in fiscal year based on the impact of anticipated renewals of existing agreements and anticipated contract signings with clients included in our current sales pipeline 
the company uses the term backlog to reflect the estimated future amount of managed services revenue related to its managed services contracts 
the value of these contracts is based on anticipated usage volumes over the anticipated term of the agreement 
the anticipated term of the agreement is based on the contractually agreed fixed term of the contract  plus agreed upon  but optional extension periods 
actual volumes may be greater or less than anticipated 
in addition  actual agreement terms may vary from the anticipated terms because these contracts typically are cancellable without cause based on the customer making a substantial early termination payment or forfeiture of prepaid contract amounts 
the reported behavioral analytics managed service backlog is expected to be recognized as follows million in  million in  million in  and million in and thereafter 
year ended december  compared with the year ended january  services revenue services revenue is total revenue excluding reimbursable expenses that are billed to our clients 
our services revenue decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year behavioral analytics revenue was million in fiscal year and was million in fiscal year behavioral analytics revenue increased million in fiscal year due to increased subscription fees associated with the conversion of several deployments to the subscription phase of the agreement 
other revenue decreased by million in fiscal year to million  from million in fiscal year  a decrease of 
the decrease in revenue was mainly due to the completion of several contracts for marketing managed services and crm services performed for clients in fiscal year and lower demand for crm services from existing clients who utilize these services 
the company s top five clients accounted for of total revenue in fiscal years and the top clients accounted for of total revenue in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year in fiscal years and  there were three and four clients  respectively  that accounted for or more of total revenue

in fiscal year  vangent  inc  united healthcare services  inc  health care service corporation  and allstate insurance company accounted for    and of total revenue  respectively 
higher concentration of revenue with a single client or a limited group of clients creates increased revenue risk if one of these clients significantly reduces its demand for our services

our cash and cash equivalents position increased million  or  as of december   from million as of january  our ics business unit  which was classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements  did not include any cash or cash equivalents

days sales outstanding dso for continuing operations was days at december  compared to days at january   an increase of three days 
this increase was primarily due to the impact of the completion of the sale of the ics business unit on our customer concentration 
because a high percentage of our revenue is dependent on a relatively small number of clients  delayed payments by a few of our larger clients could result in a reduction of our available cash  which in turn may cause fluctuation in our dso
