table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
due to the nature of the resolute transaction  two sets of financial statements are presented in this report 
the first set covers the reporting company  resolute 
the second set covers the predecessor company  predecessor resolute  through september  the following discussion relating to the business of resolute is presented in one combined section with the results for the twelve months ended december  compared to the results for the twelve months ended december  and the combined results of resolute for the days ended december  and predecessor resolute for the day period ended september  overview resolute is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil  gas and hydrocarbon liquids 
resolute s strategy is to grow through exploration  exploitation and industry standard enhanced oil recovery projects 
as of december   resolute s estimated net proved reserves were approximately mmboe  of which approximately were proved developed producing reserves and approximately were oil 
the standardized measure of resolute s estimated net proved reserves as of december   was million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
resolute focuses its efforts on increasing reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long term operations 
resolute s future earnings and cash flow from existing operations are dependent on a variety of factors including commodity prices  exploitation and recovery activities and its ability to manage its overall cost structure at a level that allows for profitable operation 
how resolute evaluates its operations resolute s management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze its operating performance  including but not limited to  production levels  trends and prices  reserve trends  operating and general and administrative expenses  operating cash flow  and adjusted ebitda defined below 
production levels  trends and prices 
oil and gas revenue is the product of resolute s production multiplied by the price that it receives for that production 
because the price that resolute receives is highly dependent on many factors outside of its control  except to the extent that it has entered into derivative arrangements that can influence its net price either positively or negatively  production is the primary revenue driver over which it has some influence 
although resolute cannot greatly alter reservoir performance  it can aggressively implement exploitation activities that can increase production or diminish production declines relative to what would have been the case without intervention 
examples of activities that can positively influence production include minimizing production downtime due to equipment malfunction  well workovers and cleanouts  recompletions of existing wells in new parts of the reservoir  and expanded secondary and tertiary recovery programs 
the price of crude oil has been extremely volatile  and resolute expects that this volatility will continue 
given the inherent volatility of crude oil prices  resolute plans its activities and budget based on sales price assumptions that it believes to be reasonable 
resolute uses derivative contracts to provide a measure of stability to its cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and currently has such contracts in place through these instruments limit its exposure to declines in prices  but also limit its benefits if prices increase 
changes in the price of oil or gas will result in the recognition of a non cash gain or loss recorded in other income or expense due to changes in the future fair value of the derivative contracts 
recognized gains or losses only arise from payments made or received on monthly settlements of derivative contracts or if a derivative contract is terminated prior to its expiration 
resolute typically enters into derivative contracts that cover a significant portion of its estimated future oil and gas production 
resolute currently has such derivative contracts in place through reserve trends 
from inception  predecessor resolute grew its reserve base through a focused acquisition strategy  completing three significant acquisitions 
these included the acquisition of the majority of its aneth field properties through two significant purchases the acquisition of the chevron properties was completed in november followed by the acquisition of the exxonmobil properties in april predecessor resolute acquired all of its wyoming properties through the purchase of primary natural resources  inc now known as rwi in july subsequent to the resolute transaction  resolute acquired its north dakota properties in and and its texas properties in and plans to continue to seek opportunities to acquire similar producing properties that have upside potential through low risk development drilling and exploitation projects 
resolute believes that its knowledge of various domestic on shore operating areas  strong management and staff and solid industry relationships will allow it to locate  capitalize on and integrate strategic acquisition opportunities 

table of contents at december   resolute had estimated net proved reserves of approximately mmboe that were classified as proved developed non producing and proved undeveloped 
an estimated mmboe  or  of those reserves are attributable to recoveries associated with expansions  extensions and processing of the tertiary recovery co floods that are currently in operation on resolute s aneth field properties 
resolute believes that these expenditures will result in significant increases in its oil and gas production 
operating expenses 
operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of oil and gas properties and are classified as lease operating expenses and production and ad valorem taxes 
direct labor  repair and maintenance  workovers  utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of lease operating expenses 
resolute monitors its operating expenses in relation to the amount of production and the number of wells operated 
some of these expenses are relatively independent of the volume of hydrocarbons produced  but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period 
other expenses  such as taxes and utility costs  are more directly related to production volumes or reserves 
severance taxes  for example  are charged based on production revenue and therefore are based on the product of the volumes that are sold and the related price received 
ad valorem taxes are generally based on the value of reserves 
because resolute operates on the navajo reservation  it also pays a possessory interest tax  which is effectively an ad valorem tax assessed by the navajo nation 
resolute s largest utility expense is for electricity that is used primarily to power the pumps in producing wells and the compressors behind the injection wells 
the more fluid that is moved  the greater the amount of electricity that is consumed 
higher oil prices can lead to higher demand for drilling rigs  workover rigs  operating personnel and field supplies and services  which in turn can increase the costs of those goods and services 
resolute projects cash lease operating expenses of million to million 
general and administrative expenses 
resolute monitors its general and administrative expenses carefully  attempting to balance the cash effect of incurring general and administrative costs against the benefits of  among other things  hiring and retaining highly qualified staff who can add value to the company s asset base 
general and administrative expenses include  among other things  salaries and benefits  share based compensation  general corporate overhead  fees paid to independent auditors  lawyers  petroleum engineers and other professional advisors  costs associated with shareholder reports  investor relations activities  registrar and transfer agent fees  director and officer liability insurance costs and director compensation 
operating cash flow 
operating cash flow is the cash directly derived from resolute s oil and gas properties  before considering such things as administrative expenses and interest costs 
operating cash flow on a per unit of production basis is a measure of field efficiency  and can be compared to results obtained by operators of oil and gas properties with characteristics similar to resolute s in order to evaluate relative performance 
aggregate operating cash flow is a measure of resolute s ability to sustain overhead expenses and costs related to capital structure  including interest expenses 
adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda a non gaap measure is defined by the company as consolidated net income adjusted to exclude interest expense  interest income  income taxes  depletion  depreciation and amortization  impairment expense  accretion of asset retirement obligation  change in fair value of derivative instruments  expiration of derivative premiums  non cash equity based compensation expense  early settlement of derivative instruments and noncontrolling interest amounts 
adjusted ebitda is a financial measure that resolute reports to its lenders and uses as a gauge for compliance with some of the financial covenants under its revolving credit facility 
adjusted ebitda is also used as a supplemental liquidity or performance measure by resolute s management and by external users of its financial statements such as investors  commercial banks  research analysts and others  to assess the ability of resolute s assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  the financial metrics that support resolute s indebtedness  resolute s ability to finance capital expenditures  financial performance of the assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  resolute s operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the exploration and production industry  without regard to financing methods or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 

table of contents adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap as measures of operating performance  liquidity or ability to service debt obligations 
because resolute has borrowed money to finance its operations  interest expense is a necessary element of its costs and its ability to generate gross margins 
because resolute uses capital assets  depletion  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of its costs 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  resolute believes that it is important to consider both net income and net cash provided by operating activities determined under gaap  as well as adjusted ebitda  to evaluate its financial performance and liquidity 
adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  operating income and net cash provided by operating activities and these measures may vary among companies 
resolute s adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda of any other company because other entities may not calculate these measures in the same manner 
factors that significantly affect resolute s financial results revenue  cash flow from operations and future growth depend substantially on factors beyond resolute s control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
crude oil prices have historically been volatile and may be expected to fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for crude oil could materially and adversely affect resolute s financial position  its results of operations  the quantities of oil and gas that it can economically produce  and its ability to obtain capital 
like all businesses engaged in the exploration for and production of oil and gas  resolute faces the challenge of natural production declines 
as initial reservoir pressures are depleted  oil and gas production from a given well decreases 
thus  an oil and gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or gas it produces 
resolute attempts to overcome this natural decline by implementing secondary and tertiary recovery techniques and by acquiring more reserves than it produces 
resolute s future growth will depend on its ability to enhance production levels from existing reserves and to continue to add reserves in excess of production through exploration  development and acquisition 
resolute will maintain its focus on costs necessary to produce its reserves as well as the costs necessary to add reserves through production enhancement  drilling and acquisitions 
resolute s ability to make capital expenditures to increase production from existing reserves and to acquire more reserves is dependent on availability of capital resources  and can be limited by many factors  including the ability to obtain capital in a cost effective manner and to timely obtain permits and regulatory approvals

results of operations through september   haci s efforts had been primarily limited to organizational activities  activities relating to its initial public offering  activities relating to identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates  and activities relating to general corporate matters 
haci had not generated any revenue  other than interest income earned on the proceeds of its initial public offering 

table of contents for the purposes of management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations of resolute  management has analyzed the operational results for the twelve months ended december   in comparison to the results for the twelve months ended december  and the combined results of resolute for the unaudited day period ended december  and predecessor resolute for the audited day period ended september  the following table reflects the components of the company s sales volumes  revenues  operating expenses  and sets forth its sales prices  costs and expenses on an equivalent barrel of oil boe basis for the periods indicated for resolute and predecessor resolute

revenue from oil and gas activities increased to million during  from million during of the million increase in revenue  approximately million was attributable to higher commodity prices  while million was attributable to increased production 
average sales price  excluding derivative settlements  increased from per boe in to per boe in  primarily as a function of increased commodity pricing 
sales volumes increased during as compared to  from  mboe to  mboe 
the well recompletion program and increased response from the company s co flood projects in the aneth field properties were the primary drivers of the production increase 
the additional increase was due to the production related to the north dakota properties  although the company did not begin drilling activities in north dakota until the end of the third quarter of  and the production attributable to the texas properties beginning in august operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased to million during  from million during  a portion of which was due to expanded operations in new areas 
the million  or  increase was primarily attributable to million in increased equipment  maintenance and supplies  million in increased utilities and fuel due to increased compression capability and additional fuel purchases in the aneth field properties  and million in increased labor costs 
production and ad valorem taxes increased by to million during  versus million during  mainly due to the increase in commodity pricing and production over production and ad valorem taxes were of total revenue in and 
table of contents depletion  depreciation  amortization and accretion expenses increased to million during  as compared to million during the million  or  increase is principally due a higher depletable base and increased production in pursuant to full cost accounting rules  resolute performs a ceiling test each quarter on its proved oil and gas assets 
no provision for impairment was recorded in or general and administrative expenses increased to million during  as compared to million during the million  or  increase resulted from a million increase in salaries and wages due to additional hiring to meet the demands of increased operations and million of increased stock based compensation expense related to additional restricted stock grants awarded to employees in these increases were offset by decreased professional service fees  a significant portion of which were charges associated with the implementation of the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act in other income expense 
all oil and gas derivative instruments are accounted for under mark to market accounting rules  which provide for the fair value of the contracts to be reflected as either an asset or a liability on the balance sheet 
the change in the fair value during an accounting period is reflected in the income statement for that period 
during  the realized and unrealized losses on our oil and gas derivatives totaled million 
this amount included approximately million of realized losses  including million of partial terminations of certain derivative contracts  offset by million of increases in the unrealized fair value of oil and gas derivatives 
during  the realized and unrealized losses on oil and gas derivatives totaled million and included approximately million of unrealized losses in the fair value of oil and gas derivatives and million of realized losses from monthly settlements 
interest expense was million during  as compared to million during the million  or  decrease is attributable to lower interest rates  a lower average debt balance and higher interest capitalization during income tax benefit expense 
income tax expense recognized during was million  or of income before income taxes  as compared to income tax expense of million  or of income before income taxes for resolute in the change in the effective rate reflects changes in permanent differences and revisions in to prior year estimates as a result of final income tax return filings 
income tax expense differs from the amount that would be provided by applying the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to state income taxes and estimated permanent differences 
the company expects income taxes to be between and of income loss before income taxes in future years 
resolute carried a million current deferred tax asset at december   for which no valuation allowance was recorded as it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized due to projected future taxable income 
year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenue 
revenue from oil and gas activities increased to million during  from million during total production increased during as compared to  from  mboe to  mboe 
the increase in production was largely attributed to an increased response from the company s co flood and recompletion projects in its aneth field properties 
in addition to natural production declines  the overall increase in production was offset by limited compression capability at the western gas resources hilight plant for the majority of full compression capability was restored in september  and management estimates that these constraints resulted in a reduction in production volumes of approximately mboe during the year  as compared to what the field was capable of producing if unconstrained 
in addition  the company voluntarily shutdown a portion of its coalbed methane production in wyoming during due to uneconomic product prices for natural gas in that area 
this led to a reduction of production volumes in of approximately mboe 
further  in the company deferred its anticipated capital projects due to low product prices and limited financial liquidity 
had these anticipated capital projects been completed  the resulting additional production in may have partially offset the natural production declines 
in addition to increased production versus  the company experienced an increase in average sales price  excluding derivatives settlements  from per boe in to per boe in  as a result of increased commodity pricing 
operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased to million during  from million during the million  or  increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in equipment maintenance and supplies  million increase in utilities and fuel and a million increase in labor costs 
the overall increase was offset by decreases in workover and compression and gathering expenses 
production and ad valorem taxes increased to million during from million during the million  or increase was mainly due to the increase in revenue 
the increase in production and ad valorem taxes was offset by a decrease in the ad valorem tax rate from of total revenue in to of total revenue in 
table of contents depletion  depreciation  amortization and accretion expenses increased to million during  as compared to million during the million  or  increase is mainly due to an increase in the per boe depletion  depreciation and amortization rate from per boe in to per boe in  due to increased capital spending versus and the increased depletable base that resulted from the acquisition accounting on the date of the resolute transaction 
pursuant to full cost accounting rules  resolute performs a ceiling test each quarter on its proved oil and gas assets 
as a result of this limitation on capitalized costs  predecessor resolute included a provision for an impairment of oil and gas property costs of million during the day period ended september  no provision for impairment was recorded in general and administrative expenses decreased to million during  as compared to million during the million  or  decrease in the absolute level of general and administrative expenses principally resulted from a decrease of million in acquisition and transaction costs incurred in in connection with the resolute transaction  the like of which were not incurred during outside of these costs  the company incurred a million increase in corporate overhead  a million increase in professional services and consulting fees  a million increase in personnel costs due to additional employees versus and accrual of the company s short term incentive plan and an increase of million in stock based compensation awarded under the company s performance incentive plan 
other income expense 
during  the realized and unrealized losses on of oil and gas derivatives totaled million 
this amount included approximately million of realized losses on oil and gas derivatives and million of decreases in the unrealized fair value of oil and gas derivatives 
during  the realized and unrealized losses on oil and gas derivatives totaled million and included approximately million of unrealized losses in the fair value of oil and gas derivatives and million of realized losses from monthly settlements 
interest expense was million during  as compared to million during the million  or  decrease is attributable to lower interest rates and a lower average debt balance during as the company utilized funds received in the resolute transaction in to pay off a significant amount of debt on the acquisition date 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax expense recognized during was million  or of income before income taxes  as compared to an income tax benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes  for resolute in the change in the effective rate reflects the differing tax jurisdictions in which resolute operates following the resolute transaction  permanent differences relating to transaction costs in and the differing entities subject to federal and state income tax prior to the resolute transaction 
income tax expense differs from the amount that would be provided by applying the statutory us federal income tax rate of due to state income taxes  estimated permanent differences and revisions to prior year estimates as a result of final income tax return filings 
resolute carried a million current deferred tax asset at december   for which no valuation allowance was recorded as it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized due to projected future taxable income 
the company expects income tax benefit expense to more closely reflect the us federal income tax rate of in future years 
liquidity and capital resources september  september  september  year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities resolute s primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  amounts available under its revolving credit facility as defined below  proceeds from warrant exercises and proceeds from sale of non strategic oil and gas properties 
net cash provided by operating activities during was million  as compared to million during and net cash used in operating activities of million in the increase from to was primarily due to higher commodity prices and production volumes and changes in working capital in and the increase from to was primarily due to a full year of oil and gas operations during resolute plans to reinvest a sufficient amount of its cash flow in its development operations in order to maintain its production over the long term  and plans to use external financing sources as well as cash flow from operations and cash reserves to increase its production 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million of net cash provided in the primary investing activity in was cash used for capital expenditures of million  consisting of million of acquisition  exploration and development expenditures and million in purchased of proved oil and gas properties 
the capital expenditures were comprised of million in compression and facility related projects  million in co acquisition  million in acquisition and leasehold costs and million in drilling activities in the permian basin of west texas  million in drilling and completion activities in the bakken trend of north dakota and million in recompletion and drilling activities in the company s wyoming properties 
a portion of these capital costs are accrued and not paid at year end 
the primary investing activity in was capital expenditures of million 
the capital expenditures were comprised of million in leasehold and exploratory costs in north dakota  million in co acquisition and million in other capital expenditures 
the cash provided in was the result of activities related to the resolute transaction 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and net cash used in financing activities of million in the primary financing activities in were million in net borrowings under the credit facility and receipt of proceeds of million from warrants exercised 
primary financing activities in were million in net borrowings under the credit facility and million in deferred financing costs related to the amended credit agreement entered into by the company on march  net cash used in financing activities during related primarily to redemption and purchase of common stock and warrants as a result of the resolute transaction 
the company is unable to predict the amount or timing of future warrant exercises 
if cash flow from operating activities does not meet expectations  resolute may reduce its expected level of capital expenditures and or fund a portion of its capital expenditures using borrowings under its credit facility  issuances of debt and equity securities or from other sources  such as asset sales 
the company has in place an effective shelf registration pursuant to which an aggregate of million of any such equity or debt securities could be issued 
there can be no assurance that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
resolute s ability to raise funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness could be limited by the covenants in its credit facility 
if resolute is unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  it may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to it or finance the capital expenditures necessary to maintain production or proved reserves 
resolute plans to continue its practice of hedging a significant portion of its production through the use of various derivative transactions 
resolute s existing derivative transactions do not qualify as cash flow hedges  and the company anticipates that future transactions will receive similar accounting treatment 
derivative arrangements are generally settled within five days of the end of the month 
as is typical in the oil and gas industry  however  resolute does not generally receive the proceeds from the sale of its crude oil production until the th day of the month following the month of production 
as a result  when commodity prices increase above the fixed price in the derivative contacts  resolute will be required to pay the derivative counterparty the difference between the fixed price in the derivative contract and the market price before receiving the proceeds from the sale of the hedged production 
if this occurs  resolute may use working capital or borrowings under the credit facility to fund its operations 
revolving credit facility resolute s credit facility is with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo bank  national association the credit facility with resolute as the borrower 
the credit facility specifies a maximum borrowing base as determined by the lenders 
the determination of the borrowing base takes into consideration the estimated value of resolute s oil and gas properties in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans 
on march   the company entered into an amended and restated credit facility agreement 
under the terms of the restated agreement  the borrowing base was initially established at million and the maturity date was extended to march during april  the company entered into two additional amendments to the amended and restated credit facility agreement 
under the terms of the amendments  the company is permitted to use proceeds received from the exercise of outstanding warrants to repurchase equity securities  the borrowing base was increased from million to million and  at resolute s option  the outstanding balance under the credit facility accrues interest at either a the london interbank offered rate  plus a margin which varies from to or b the alternative base rate defined as the greater of i the administrative agent s prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus  or iii an adjusted london interbank offered rate plus  plus a margin which ranges from to 
each such margin is based on the level of utilization under the borrowing base 
as of december  and  the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balance under the credit facility was and  respectively 
the recorded value of the credit facility approximates its fair market value 
the borrowing base is redetermined semi annually and the amount available for borrowing could be increased or decreased as a result of such redeterminations 
under certain circumstances  either resolute or the lenders may request an interim redetermination 
during november  as the result of a redetermination  the borrowing base was increased to million 
as of december   outstanding borrowings were million and unused availability under the borrowing base was million 
the borrowing base availability had been reduced by million in conjunction with letters of credit issued to vendors at december  to the extent that the borrowing base  as adjusted from time to time  exceeds the outstanding balance  no repayments of principal are required prior to maturity 
the credit facility is guaranteed by all of resolute s subsidiaries and is collateralized by substantially all of the proved oil and gas assets of aneth and resolute wyoming  inc  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the company 

table of contents the credit facility includes terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  the payment of dividends  and require satisfaction of certain financial tests 
resolute was in compliance with all material terms and covenants of the credit facility at december  resolute energy corporation  the stand alone parent entity  has insignificant independent assets and no operations 
there are no restrictions on the company s ability to obtain cash dividends or other distributions of funds from its subsidiaries  except those imposed by applicable law 
off balance sheet arrangements resolute does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases 
resolute has not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non financial assets 
contractual obligations resolute had the following contractual obligations and commitments for the next five years as of december  september  september  september  september  september  less than year years years more than years total in thousands obligations long term debt office and equipment leases operating equipment leases vehicle leases derivative premiums exxonmobil escrow agreement construction purchase obligations co purchases total long term debt represents the outstanding principal amount under resolute s credit facility 
this table does not include future commitment fees  interest expense or other fees because the credit facility is a floating rate instrument  and the company cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances  repayments or future interest rates to be charged 
operating equipment leases consist of compressors and other oil and gas field equipment used in the co project 
under the terms of resolute s purchase agreement with exxonmobil  resolute is obligated to make annual deposits into an escrow account that will be used to fund plugging and abandonment liabilities associated with the exxonmobil properties 
represents purchase commitments in effect at december  related to construction projects in the aneth field properties 
represents the minimum take or pay quantities associated with resolute s existing co 

purchase contracts 
for purposes of calculating the future purchase obligation under these contracts  resolute has assumed the purchase price over the term of the contract was the price in effect as of december  total contractually obligated payment commitments do not include the anticipated settlement of derivative contracts  obligations to taxing authorities or amounts relating to our asset retirement obligations  which include plugging and abandonment obligations  due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement amounts and timing of these obligations 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of resolute s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires resolute to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the application of accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
resolute evaluates estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
resolute bases estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ  perhaps materially  from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of resolute s financial statements 
provided below is an expanded discussion of resolute s most significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the financial statements 
oil and gas properties 
resolute uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties  including costs of unsuccessful exploration  costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals and the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement and abandonment activities  improved recovery systems and a portion of general and administrative and operating expenses are capitalized within the cost center 

table of contents resolute conducts tertiary recovery projects on a portion of its oil and gas properties in order to recover additional hydrocarbons that are not recoverable from primary or secondary recovery methods 
under the full cost method  all development costs are capitalized at the time incurred 
development costs include charges associated with access to and preparation of well locations  drilling and equipping development wells  test wells  and service wells including injection wells  acquiring  constructing  and installing production facilities and providing for improved recovery systems 
improved recovery systems include all related facility development costs and the cost of the acquisition of tertiary injectants  primarily purchased co the development cost related to co purchases are incurred solely for the purpose of gaining access to incremental reserves not otherwise recoverable 
the accumulation of injected co  in combination with additional purchased and recycled co  provide future economic value over the life of the project 
in contrast  other costs related to the daily operation of the improved recovery systems are considered production costs and are expensed as incurred 
these costs include  but are not limited to  costs incurred to maintain reservoir pressure  compression  electricity  separation  and re injection of recovered co and water 
capitalized general and administrative and operating costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other specifically identifiable capital costs and do not include costs related to production operations  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted  pending determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are periodically evaluated for impairment 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment when it is not practicable to assess the amount of impairment of properties on an individual basis 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized  or is reported as a period expense as appropriate 
pursuant to full cost accounting rules  resolute must perform a ceiling test each quarter on its proved oil and gas assets 
the ceiling test provides that capitalized costs less related accumulated depletion and deferred income taxes for each cost center may not exceed the sum of the present value of future net revenue from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves using current prices  excluding the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  and a discount factor of  plus the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less income tax effects related to differences in the book and tax basis of oil and gas properties 
should the net capitalized costs for a cost center exceed the sum of the components noted above  an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent of the excess capitalized costs 
no gain or loss is recognized upon the sale or abandonment of undeveloped or producing oil and gas properties unless the sale represents a significant portion of oil and gas properties and the gain significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil reserves of the cost center 
depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties is computed on the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
amortizable costs include estimates of asset retirement obligations and future development costs of proved reserves  including  but not limited to  costs to drill and equip development wells  constructing and installing production and processing facilities  and improved recovery systems including the cost of required future co purchases 
oil and gas reserve quantities 
resolute s estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analyses demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows affect resolute s depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserves estimates 
resolute prepares reserves estimates  and the projected cash flows derived from these reserves estimates  in accordance with sec and fasb guidelines 
the accuracy of resolute s reserves estimates is a function of many factors including but not limited to the following the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
resolute s proved reserves estimates are a function of many assumptions  any or all of which could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserves estimates may vary materially from the ultimate quantities of oil  gas and natural gas liquids eventually recovered 

table of contents derivative instruments 
resolute enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and may take the form of futures contracts  swaps or options 
derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
resolute s management has determined that the benefit of cash flow hedge accounting  which may allow for its derivative instruments to be reflected as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income  is not commensurate with the administrative burden required to support that treatment 
as a result  resolute marks its derivative instruments to fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes the changes in fair market value in earnings 
realized gains and losses on derivative instruments are recognized in the period in which the related contract is settled 
both the realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments are reflected in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
cash flows from derivatives are reported as cash flows from operating activities unless the derivative contract is deemed to contain a financing element 
derivatives deemed to contain a financing element are reported as financing activities in the statement of cash flows 
fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the guidance establishes market or observable inputs as the preferred sources of values  followed by assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs 
the guidance establishes a hierarchy for determining the fair values of assets and liabilities  based on the significance level of the following inputs level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable 
an asset or liability subject to the fair value requirements is categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
resolute s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used by resolute as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the hierarchy 
as of december   resolute s commodity derivative instruments were required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
resolute used the income approach in determining the fair value of its derivative instruments  utilizing present value techniques for valuing its swaps and basis swaps and option pricing models for valuing its collars 
inputs to these valuation techniques include published forward index prices  volatilities  and credit risk considerations  including the incorporation of published interest rates and credit spreads 
substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the contract  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace and are therefore designated as level within the valuation hierarchy 
asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations relate to future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells  removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and returning such land to its original condition 
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred typically when the asset is installed at the production location  and the cost of such liability increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by the same amount 
the liability is accreted each period and the capitalized cost is depleted on a units of production basis as part of the full cost pool 
revisions to estimated retirement obligations result in adjustments to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability 
resolute s estimated asset retirement obligation liability is based on estimated economic lives  estimates as to the cost to abandon the wells in the future  and federal and state regulatory requirements 
the liability is discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate estimated at the time the liability is incurred or revised 
revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in estimated abandonment costs or well economic lives  or if federal or state regulators enact new requirements regarding the abandonment of wells 

table of contents share based compensation 
share based compensation is measured based on the grant date fair value of equity awards given to employees in exchange for services  and to recognize that cost  less estimated forfeitures  over the period that such services are performed 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns 
the ability to realize the deferred tax assets is routinely assessed 
if the conclusion is that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
the future taxable income is considered when making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 
income tax positions are also required to meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 

table of contents item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and derivative arrangements resolute s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to oil and gas production 
realized pricing on resolute s unhedged volumes of production is primarily driven by the spot market prices applicable to oil production and the prevailing price for gas 
pricing for oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and resolute expects this volatility to continue in the future 
the prices resolute receives for unhedged production depend on many factors outside of resolute s control 
resolute periodically hedges a portion of its oil and gas production through swaps  puts  calls  collars and other such agreements 
the purpose of the hedges is to provide a measure of stability to resolute s cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage resolute s exposure to commodity price risk 
under the terms of its credit agreement the form of derivative instruments to be entered into is at resolute s discretion  not to exceed of its anticipated production from proved developed producing properties utilizing economic parameters specified in its credit agreement  including escalated prices and costs 
by removing the price volatility from a significant portion of resolute s oil and gas production  resolute has mitigated  but not eliminated  the potential effects of changing prices on the cash flow from operations for periods hedged 
while mitigating negative effects of falling commodity prices  certain of these derivative contracts also limit the benefits resolute would receive from increases in commodity prices 
it is resolute s policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are major  creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers 
as of december   resolute had entered into certain derivative instruments that are summarized in the tables below

derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
resolute marks its derivative instruments to fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes the changes in fair market value in earnings 
at december   the fair value of our commodity derivatives was a net liability of million 
interest rate risk at december   resolute had million of outstanding debt under the credit facility 
interest is calculated under the terms of the agreement based on a libor spread 
a increase in libor would result in an estimated million increase in annual interest expense 
resolute does not currently have or intend to enter into any derivative arrangements to protect against fluctuations in interest rates applicable to its outstanding indebtedness
