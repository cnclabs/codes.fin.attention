the risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients with severe and ultra rare disorders through the innovation  development and commercialization of life transforming therapeutic products 
our marketed product soliris eculizumab is the first and only therapeutic approved for patients with two ultra rare and severe disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria pnh  an ultra rare and life threatening blood disorder  and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome ahus  an ultra rare and life threatening genetic disease 
we are also evaluating other potential indications for soliris in other diseases in which chronic uncontrolled complement activation is the underlying mechanism  and we are progressing with other biotechnology product candidates in ultra rare and severe disorders which are now in various stages of development 
we were incorporated in and began commercial sale of soliris in soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic disorders in the therapeutic areas of hematology  nephrology  transplant rejection  neurology and ophthalmology 
soliris is a humanized monoclonal antibody that effectively blocks terminal complement activity at the doses currently prescribed 
the initial indication for which we received approval for soliris is pnh 
pnh is an ultra rare  debilitating and life threatening  deficiency blood disorder defined by chronic uncontrolled complement activation leading to the destruction of red blood cells  or hemolysis 
the chronic hemolysis in patients with pnh may be associated with life threatening thromboses  recurrent pain  kidney disease  disabling fatigue  impaired quality of life  severe anemia  pulmonary hypertension  shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark colored urine hemoglobinuria 
soliris was approved for the treatment of pnh by the us food and drug administration fda and the european commission ec in and by japan s ministry of health  labour and welfare mhlw in  and has been approved in several other territories 
additionally  in soliris was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of pnh in the united states  europe  japan and several other territories 
in september  soliris was approved by the fda for the treatment of all pediatric and adult patients with ahus 
ahus is a genetic ultra rare disease characterized by chronic uncontrolled complement activation and thrombotic microangiopathy  the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body  causing a reduction in platelet count thrombocytopenia and life threatening damage to the kidney  brain  heart and other vital organs 
also in november  the ec granted marketing authorization for soliris to treat pediatric and adult patients with ahus in europe 
in  the fda and ec granted soliris orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with ahus 
on february   we acquired enobia pharma corp 
enobia  a privately held clinical stage biotechnology company based in montreal  canada and cambridge  massachusetts  in a transaction expected to be accounted for as a business combination 
the acquisition was intended to further our objective to develop and deliver therapies for patients with ultra rare  severe  and life threatening disorders 
enobia s lead product candidate asfotase alfa  is a human recombinant targeted alkaline phosphatase enzyme replacement therapy for patients suffering with hypophosphatasia hpp  an ultra rare  life threatening  genetic metabolic disease for which there are no approved treatments 
we made an upfront cash payment of  subject to purchase price adjustments  for of enobia s capital stock 
additional contingent payments of up to an aggregate of  would be due upon reaching various regulatory and sales milestones 
we financed the acquisition through available cash and proceeds from our new credit facility 
on february   we acquired patents and assets from orphatec pharmaceuticals gmbh orphatec related to an investigational therapy for patients with type a molybdenum cofactor deficiency mocd  an ultra rare disorder characterized by severe brain damage and rapid death in newborn infants 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination 
orphatec is a privately held development stage biotechnology company with headquarters in cologne  germany 
we made an upfront cash payment of approximately  and additional contingent payments of up to  would be earned upon reaching various development  regulatory and commercial milestones 
we will also make future payments to orphatec for manufacturing  development and other services 
on january   we acquired taligen therapeutics  inc taligen  a privately held development stage biotechnology company based in cambridge  massachusetts  in a transaction accounted for as a business combination 
the acquisition was intended to broaden our portfolio of preclinical compounds and to expand our capabilities in translational medicine 
preclinical compounds acquired from taligen include product candidates for the potential treatment of patients with ophthalmic diseases such as age related macular degeneration amd  as well as other novel antibody and protein regulators of the complement inflammatory pathways 
we made an upfront cash payments of  for of taligen s equity interests 
additional contingent payments of up to an aggregate of  would be due upon reaching various clinical efficacy and product approval milestones in both the united states and european union for up to six product candidates 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note  business overview and summary of significant accounting policies 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the judgments  estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  contingent liabilities  inventories  research and development expenses  share based compensation  valuation of goodwill  acquired intangible assets and in process research and development ipr d  valuation of contingent consideration  and income taxes 
revenue recognition net product sales our principal source of revenue is product sales 
we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
revenue is recorded upon receipt of the product by the end customer  which is typically a hospital  physician s office  private or government pharmacy or other health care facility 
amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities  such as value added taxes vat in foreign jurisdictions  are presented on a net basis in our statements of operations and do not impact net product sales 
in the united states  our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies which supply physician office clinics  hospital outpatient clinics  infusion clinics or home health care providers 
we also sell soliris to government agencies 
outside the united states  our customers are primarily hospitals  hospital buying groups  pharmacies  other health care providers and distributors 
because of factors such as the pricing of soliris  the limited number of patients  the short period from product sale to patient infusion and the lack of contractual return rights  soliris customers often carry limited inventory 
we also monitor inventory within our sales channels to determine whether deferrals are appropriate based on factors such as inventory levels  contractual terms and financial strength of distributors 
to date  actual refunds and returns have been negligible 
we have entered into volume based arrangements with governments in certain countries in which reimbursement is limited to a contractual amount 
we estimate incremental discounts resulting from these contractual limitations  based on estimated sales during the limited period  and we apply the discount percentage to product shipments as a reduction of revenue 
in addition to sales in countries where soliris is commercially available  we have also recorded revenue on sales for patients receiving soliris treatment through named patient programs 
the relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named patient basis where soliris has not received final approval for commercial sale 
we record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs  including medicaid in the united states and other programs outside the united states  as a reduction of revenue at the time of product sale 
our calculations related to these rebate accruals require analysis of historical claim patterns and estimates of customer mix to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments  which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made 
generally  the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to six months 
we have provided balances and activity in the rebates payable account for the years ended december   and as follows rebates payable balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in prior years balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in prior years balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in prior years balance at december  we record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue  unless we receive an identifiable and separate benefit for the consideration  and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
if both conditions are met  we record the consideration paid to the customer as an operating expense 
these costs are typically known at the time of sale  resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted intercompany revenues that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
these hedges are designated as cash flow hedges upon inception 
we record the effective portion of these cash flow hedges to revenue in the period in which the sale is made to an unrelated third party and the derivative contract is settled 
we sell soliris to a limited number of customers  and we evaluate the creditworthiness of each such customer on a regular basis 
in certain european countries  sales by us are subject to payment terms that are statutorily determined 
this is primarily the case in countries where the payor is government owned or government funded  which we consider to be creditworthy 
the length of time from sale to receipt of payment in certain countries typically exceeds our credit terms 
in countries in which collections from customers extend beyond normal payment terms  we seek to collect interest 
we record interest on customer receivables as interest income when collected 
for non interest bearing receivables with an estimated payment beyond one year  we discount the accounts receivable to present value at the date of sale  with a corresponding adjustment to revenue 
subsequent adjustments for further declines in credit rating are recorded as bad debt expense as a component of selling  general and administrative expense 
we also use judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables if and when collection becomes doubtful 
we continue to monitor economic conditions  including volatility associated with international economies  associated impacts on the financial markets and our business and the sovereign debt crisis in europe 
the credit and economic conditions in greece  italy  spain and portugal  among other members of the european union have deteriorated throughout these conditions have resulted in  and may continue to result in  an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries 
as of december   our accounts receivable in greece  italy  spain  ireland and portugal were approximately  approximately  of this amount has been outstanding for greater than one year  and we have recorded an allowance of approximately  related to these receivables as of december  in july  we received non interest bearing bonds issued by the greek government that mature in and for payment on receivables from and as part of the greek government s plan for its repayment of its debt to international pharmaceutical companies 
we sold the bonds in july during the year ended december   we have recorded bad debt expense of approximately  related to the reduction of value of greek bonds and other reduction in the realizable value of our accounts receivable in these countries 
contingent liabilities we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim  asserted or unasserted  or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation  accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information 
on a periodic basis  as additional information becomes available  or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims  we may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates  which could result in a material adverse adjustment to our operating results 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the weighted average cost method 
we capitalize inventory produced for commercial sale  including costs incurred prior to regulatory approval but subsequent to the filing of a biologics license application bla when we have determined that the inventory has probable future economic benefit 
inventory is not capitalized prior to completion of a phase iii clinical trial 
for products with an approved indication  raw materials and purchased drug product associated with clinical development programs are included in inventory and charged to research and development expense when consumed 
for products without and approved indication  purchased drug product is charged to research and development expense upon final quality release 
we also capitalize the cost of inventory manufactured at our manufacturing plant in property  plant and equipment prior to the approval of the facility by regulatory authorities 
we analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value  or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements 
although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control  certain batches or units of product may  after a period of time  no longer meet quality specifications or may expire  at which point we would adjust our inventory values 
soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of months and  based on our sales forecasts  we expect to realize the carrying value of the soliris inventory 
in the future  reduced demand  quality issues or excess supply beyond those anticipated by management may result in an adjustment to inventory levels  which would be recorded as an increase to cost of sales 
the determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management 
a critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements based on internal sales forecasts 
we then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand 
to the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold  we will write down the value of inventory 
if actual results differ from those estimates  additional inventory write offs may be required 
research and development expenses we accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations cro s  clinical study sites  laboratories  consultants  or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities 
related contracts vary significantly in length  and may be for a fixed amount  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or for a combination of these elements 
activity levels are monitored through close communication with the cro s and other clinical trial vendors  including detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts  analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules  and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed 
certain cro and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial 
the estimates are reviewed and discussed with the cro or vendor as necessary  and are included in research and development expenses for the related period 
for clinical study sites  which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter 
the estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced  which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed 
share based compensation we grant equity awards under one share based compensation plan known as the amended and restated incentive plan 
under this plan  restricted stock  restricted stock units  stock options and other stock related awards may be granted to our directors  officers  employees and consultants or advisors of the company or any subsidiary 
stock related awards are also outstanding under other share based compensation plans but we have not granted awards under these plans since our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the black scholes model 
the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events 
significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility 
we also estimate expected term until exercise  forfeiture or cancellation  as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures 
we currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life 
actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates 
if factors change or we employ different assumptions  the share based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts 
valuation of goodwill  acquired intangible assets and ipr d we have recorded goodwill  acquired intangible assets and ipr d primarily through the taligen and orphatec acquisitions 
when identifiable intangible assets  including ipr d  are acquired  we determine the fair values of the assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available  and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to timing and costs to complete the in process projects  timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals  estimated future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and discount rates 
we may also utilize a cost approach  which estimates the costs that would be incurred to replace the assets being purchased 
significant inputs into the cost approach include estimated rates of return on historical costs that a market participant would expect to pay for these assets 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur 
intangible assets related to ipr d are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets and not amortized until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities in specified markets 
at that time  we will determine the useful life of the asset  reclassify the asset out of ipr d and begin amortization 
impairment testing is also performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment 
if these projects are not successfully developed  our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the acquired intangible assets  including ipr d  may become impaired if the underlying projects do not progress as we initially estimated 
we believe that the assumptions used in developing our estimates of intangible asset values were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisitions 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs  profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will occur as estimated 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment 
we are organized as a single reporting unit and therefore the goodwill impairment test is done using our overall market value  as determined by our traded share price  as compared to our book value of net assets 
we completed our annual impairment test as of december  and determined the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired 
valuation of contingent consideration we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date 
we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals  timing and probability of success of meeting commercial milestones  such as sales levels of a specific compound  and discount rates 
our contingent consideration liabilities arose in connection with the taligen and orphatec acquisitions 
on a quarterly basis  we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings 
changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates  accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time  changes in our estimates of the likelihood of or timing of achieving any development or commercial milestones  changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 
the assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment  and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that has been taken or we expect to take on income tax returns if such tax position is more likely than not to be sustained 
we follow the authoritative guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists  advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which may be subject to material adjustments until matters are resolved with taxing authorities or statutes expire 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets where realization is not certain 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent future expectations change  we would assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time 
if we determine that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period  we would record material adjustments to income tax expense in that period 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new standard on fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the new standard changes fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements including measuring the fair value of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio  the application of applying premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement  and additional disclosure about fair value measurements 
the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect a material impact with the adoption of this new standard 
in june  the fasb issued a new standard on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard eliminated the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
under the new standard  companies can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new standard is effective at the beginning of fiscal years beginning after december   and we will comply with this requirement in the first quarter in september  the fasb issued a new standard to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
the new standard allows companies an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining if it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under the new standard  a company is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the company determines  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the new standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated

research and development expense our research and development expense includes personnel  facility and external costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates  as well as product development costs 
we group our research and development expenses into two major categories external direct expenses and all other r d expenses 
external direct expenses are comprised of costs paid to outside parties for clinical development  product development and discovery research 
clinical development costs are comprised of costs to conduct and manage clinical trials related to eculizumab and other product candidates 
product development costs are those incurred in performing duties related to manufacturing development and regulatory functions 
discovery research costs are incurred in conducting laboratory studies and performing preclinical research for other uses of eculizumab and other product candidates 
clinical development costs have been accumulated and allocated to each of our programs  while product development and discovery research costs have not been allocated 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs relate to efforts on our clinical and preclinical products  our product development and our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been allocated directly to each program 
the following table provides information regarding research and development expenses year ended december  year ended december  variance variance clinical development product development discovery research total external direct expenses payroll and benefits operating and occupancy depreciation and amortization total other r d expenses research and development expense the following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs

substantially all of our research and development expenses prior to the year ended december  were related to two products  eculizumab and pexelizumab 
we obtained approval for eculizumab for the treatment of pnh in in the united states and european union  and we made the decision to cease development of pexelizumab in the successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot guarantee that results of clinical trials will be favorable or sufficient to support regulatory approvals for our other programs 
we could decide to abandon development or be required to spend considerable resources not otherwise contemplated 
for additional discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding our development programs  please refer to the risk factors in this form k 
during the year ended december   we incurred research and development expenses of  an increase of  or versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to the following increase of  in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to global expansion of staff supporting our increasing number of clinical and development programs 
increase of  in external product development expenses related primarily to costs associated with our nephrology clinical programs and regulatory affairs for supporting our clinical programs  including ahus 
increase of  in external clinical development expenses related primarily to an expansion of studies of eculizumab for non pnh indications  including costs for the stec hus trial initiated in the second quarter see table above 
increase of  in discovery research expenses related primarily to costs associated with our new translation medicine group initiated from the acquisition of taligen 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in due to clinical development and manufacturing costs related to our expanding development programs  as well as expenses related to enobia programs

selling  general and administrative expense our selling  general and administrative expense includes commercial and administrative personnel  corporate facility and external costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products 
these selling  general and administrative costs include corporate facility operating expenses and depreciation  marketing and sales operations in support of soliris  human resources  finance  legal  information technology and support personnel expenses  and other corporate costs such as telecommunications  insurance  audit and legal expenses 
during the year ended december   we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of  an increase of  or  versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to the following during the year ended december   salaries  benefits and other labor expenses increased to  an increase of  or  versus  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities  including increases in payroll and benefits costs of  related to our global commercial staff to support global expansion and to prepare for the initiation of soliris as a therapy for ahus which was granted approval in the united states and europe in the fourth quarter this increase was also due to increases in payroll and benefits of  within our general and administrative functions to support our infrastructure growth as a global commercial entity 
increase in external selling  general and administrative expenses of  was primarily due to costs associated with marketing and professional services of  occupancy costs of  due to expansion of current facilities in the united states and switzerland and new facilities in turkey  india and china and  increases of  due to increased bad debt expense associated with declines in credit ratings on our greek receivables in quarters subsequent to the recognition of the corresponding revenue 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase  at a lower rate than our revenue  in  reflecting our growth as a commercial organization throughout the world 
acquisition related costs we incurred the following acquisition related costs in associated with our acquisitions of taligen  orphatec and enobia december  separately identifiable employee costs professional fees changes in fair value of contingent consideration other income and expense foreign currency transaction gains and losses relate to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of foreign currency loss  a decrease of  versus a loss of  incurred during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates on the portion of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not fully hedged as part of our hedging programs 
we recognize investment income primarily from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
during the year ended december   investment income increased  or to  due primarily to higher cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances

the counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are large multinational commercial banks  and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material

we have classified our financial assets and liabilities as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

our level liabilities consist also of foreign exchange forward contracts 
level inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value

the estimates of amounts potentially owed to other third parties may be influenced by the outcome of future litigation or other claims  if any  the results of which are uncertain 
an increase in estimated amounts owed or a requirement to pay these amounts on an accelerated basis may result in a material adverse effect on liquidity 
we expect continued growth in our expenditures  particularly those related to research and product development  clinical trials  regulatory approvals  international expansion  commercialization of products and capital investment 
however  we anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operations as currently planned for the foreseeable future 
cash flows change in cash and cash equivalents year ended december  variance net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents the increase in cash and cash equivalents from december  was primarily due to cash generated from operations  maturities of marketable securities  and stock option exercises  offset by cash used for the taligen and orphatec acquisitions

increases were offset by an increase of  in deferred revenue due to increased shipments in advance of recognizing revenue and an increase of  in accounts payable and accrued expenses related to rebates  royalties and compensation

maturities of marketable securities of  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively

in february  we completed a business combination of enobia 
this acquisition required us to make payments of approximately  which we have paid from our available cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from our new credit facility 
the integration of enobia into our current operations is in the initial phases 
we are also in the initial stages of evaluating the tax impact of the enobia acquisition 
we have made preliminary plans for structuring the enobia legal entities  including a determination of which legal entities will own the acquired assets  which could create a tax liability during based on a preliminary analysis  the amount of tax liability could be up to  we have not determined the timing or amount of the tax liability  and the final amounts and timing could change based on various factors such as finalization of asset valuations and further tax analyzes related to the acquired assets 
we believe we will have sufficient available cash to pay the liability when it becomes due 
in addition to the upfront payments  the purchase agreements for the enobia  taligen and orphatec acquisitions also include contingent payments totaling up to   and  respectively  if and when certain development and commercial milestones are achieved 
of these milestone amounts   and  of the contingent payments relate to development and commercial milestones  respectively 
we do not expect that any contingent payments will be made in the next months and  accordingly  we do not expect these amounts to have an impact on our liquidity in the near term 
as future payments become probable  we will evaluate methods of funding payments  which could be made from available cash  cash generated from operations or proceeds from other financing 
financing activities net cash flows from financing activities reflected proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

in connection with the acquisition of enobia in february  we borrowed approximately  under the facility and used our available cash for the remaining purchase price 
we borrowed  under the term loan facility and  under the revolving facility 
the term loan facility requires minimum quarterly payments of  starting in june  and we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to fund the required principal and interest payments 
we expect to repay the revolving facility over the next to years as we generate cash from operations 
in addition to the amounts borrowed  approximately  is available for borrowing under the revolving facility which we can utilize as needed

since the commercial launch of soliris in  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through positive cash flows from operations 
we expect to continue to be able to fund for the foreseeable future  our operations including principal and interest payments on our credit facility and contingent payments from our acquisitions principally through our cash flows from operations and our existing cash resources and access to additional financing  if necessary 
we may  from time to time  also seek additional funding through a combination of equity or debt financings or from other sources should we identify a significant new opportunity 
the company does not provide us taxes on the undistributed earnings of its non us subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the businesses offshore 
the company does not have any present or anticipated future need for cash held by its non us subsidiaries  as cash generated in the us as well as borrowings are expected to be sufficient to meet future us liquidity needs

the table above also does not include a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal  state and foreign income tax matters of  at december  the timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at december  we do not expect payment of amounts related to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months

we do not expect to make any contingent payments in the next months

in february  the notes became due 
we issued an additional shares of our common stock upon conversion of principal amount 
subsequent to the february conversion  we have no notes outstanding

capital leases we currently lease office equipment under capital lease agreements expiring in the assets and liabilities under capital lease agreements are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset 
the assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives 
the average interest rates on the above capital leases is and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease 
operating leases our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment 
we currently lease approximately  square feet of space at our headquarters and research and development facility in cheshire  connecticut and approximately  square feet of space at our regional executive and sales offices in lausanne  switzerland 
additionally  we lease research space in san diego  california 
in connection with the closure of alexion antibody technologies in  we accrued the fair value of future payments under the lease 
in september  we entered into a sub lease for the aat facility  which provides for sub lease payments to us through the term of the lease  or august we believe that our administrative office space is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future 
we also believe that our research and development facilities and our manufacturing facility  together with third party manufacturing facilities  will be adequate for our on going activities 
in addition to the locations above  we also lease offices in other countries to facilitate our operations as a global organization 
commercial commitments our commercial commitments consist of research and development  license  operational  clinical development  and manufacturing cost commitments  along with anticipated supporting arrangements  subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses 
the timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs  which may or may not be realized  are contingent upon the progress of our clinical development programs and our commercialization plans 
our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with lonza sales ag 
lonza agreement we have supply agreements with lonza relating to the manufacture of eculizumab  which requires payments to lonza at the inception of contract and as product is manufactured 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our plans for future levels of manufacturing by lonza  which depends upon our commercial requirements  the progress of our clinical development programs and the production levels of arimf 
we currently rely on two manufacturing facilities  arimf and lonza  for producing commercial and clinical quantities of soliris 
our clinical and preclinical quantities of eculizumab  samalizumab and other product candidates are produced at arimf  at a third party facility or at both arimf and a third party facility 
we also depend on a very limited number of third party providers for other services with respect to our clinical and commercial requirements  including product finishing  packaging  vialing and labeling 
we have various agreements with lonza  with remaining total commitments of approximately  through such commitments may be canceled only in limited circumstances 
if we terminate certain supply agreements with lonza without cause  we will be required to pay for product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement 
under an existing arrangement with lonza  we also pay lonza a royalty on sales of soliris manufactured at arimf 
additional commercial commitments additional payments related to our commercial commitments  such as licenses  aggregating to approximately  would be required if we elect to continue development under our current preclinical development programs and if specified development milestones are reached including achievement of commercialization 
these amounts are not included in the above table 
income taxes at december   we have pre tax federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of  and  respectively 
these nol s expire between and we also have federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
these income tax credits expire between and due to the amount of our nol s and credit carryforwards  we do not anticipate paying substantial us federal income taxes in the near future 
we do expect to pay cash taxes in various us states and in foreign jurisdictions where we have operations and have utilized all of our net operating losses 
the tax reform act of contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayer s ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of percent over a three year period 
we have determined that these limiting provisions were triggered during a prior year 
however  we believe that such limitation is not expected to result in the expiration or loss of any significant amount of our federal nol s 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in thousands  except per share data interest rate risk as of december   we held all of our cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts and money market funds  which are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
certain of our debt instruments are variable interest rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is  therefore  subject to changes in market interest rates 
as of december  and  a basis point adverse movement increase in libor would not have a material effect on our annual interest expense 
in february  we entered into the credit agreement 
alexion may elect that the loans under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to i libor plus to depending on alexion s consolidated leverage ratio as calculated in accordance with the credit agreement  or ii in the case of borrowings in us dollars  a base rate equal to the higher of the a prime rate then in effect  b federal funds rate then in effect plus  and c eurodollar rate then in effect plus  plus in each case of a  b or c to depending on alexion s consolidated leverage ratio as calculated in accordance with the agreement 
we do not expect changes in interest rates related to the credit agreement to have a material effect on our financial statements 
foreign exchange market risk as a result of our foreign operations  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  japanese yen  swiss franc  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar against the us dollar 
the current exposures arise primarily from cash  accounts receivable  intercompany receivables and payables  and product sales denominated in foreign currencies 
both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural  opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses 
we have substantial operations based in switzerland to support our business outside the us  and accordingly  our expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the value of the swiss franc against the us dollar 
we currently have a derivative program in place to achieve the following limit the foreign currency exposure of our monetary assets and liabilities on our balance sheet  using contracts with durations of up to days and hedge a portion of our forecasted intercompany product sales  using contracts with durations of up to months 
the objectives of this program are to reduce the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues 
this program utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts intended to reduce  not eliminate  the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
as of december   we held foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling  as of december   our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net fair value of we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
the counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are multinational commercial banks 
we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material 
since our foreign currency hedges are designed to offset gains and losses on our monetary assets and liabilities  we do not expect that a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in exchange rates would result in a material change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive net assets  which include our monetary assets and liabilities and our foreign exchange forward contracts 
the analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on future transactions such as anticipated sales 
credit risk as a result of our foreign operations  we are exposed to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries we conduct business in 
we continue to monitor economic conditions  including volatility associated with international economies  associated impacts on the financial markets and our business and the sovereign debt crisis in europe 
the credit and economic conditions with greece  italy  spain  ireland and portugal  among other members of the european union have deteriorated throughout these conditions have resulted in  and may continue to result in  an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries 
as of december   our accounts receivable in greece  italy  spain  ireland and portugal were approximately  approximately  of this amount has been outstanding for greater than one year  and we have recorded an allowance of approximately  related to these receivables as of december  in july  we received non interest bearing bonds issued by the greek government that mature in and for payment on receivables from and as part of the greek government s plan for its repayment of its debt to international pharmaceutical companies 
we sold the bonds in july during the year ended december   we have recorded bad debt expense of approximately  related to the reduction of value of greek bonds and other reduction in the realizable value of our accounts receivable in these countries
