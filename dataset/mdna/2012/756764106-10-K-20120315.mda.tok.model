item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a nyse listed hospitality and leisure company ticker symbols rlh and rlh pa primarily engaged in the ownership  operation and franchising of midscale  full  select and limited service hotels under our proprietary red lion brand 
established over years ago  the red lion brand is regionally recognized and particularly well known in the western united states  where our hotels are located 
the red lion brand is typically associated with mid scale full and select service hotels 
as of december   our hotel system contained hotels located in nine states and one canadian province  with  rooms and  square feet of meeting space as provided below hotels total available rooms meeting space sq 
ft 
red lion owned and leased hotels continuing operations discontinued operations red lion franchised hotels total we operate in three reportable segments the hotels segment derives revenue primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage operations at our owned and leased hotels 
the franchise segment is engaged primarily in licensing the red lion brand to franchisees 
this segment generates revenue from franchise fees that are typically based on a percent of room revenues and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brand and access to our central services programs 
these programs include the reservation system  guest loyalty program  national and regional sales  revenue management tools  access to quality inspections and advertising and brand standards 
it has also historically reflected revenue from management fees charged to the owners of managed hotels 
we have not managed any hotels for third parties since january the entertainment segment derives revenue primarily from promotion and presentation of entertainment productions and ticketing services 
our remaining activities  which are primarily related to our ownership interest in a retail mall attached to one of our hotels and to other miscellaneous real estate investments  do not constitute a reportable segment and have been aggregated into other 
results of operations our reported numbers for the periods presented in this report reflect results of the red lion hotel on fifth avenue in seattle  wa seattle property for the full years prior to but not the full year of  as the sale of that property closed on june  in order to help investors distinguish changes from results of continuing operations versus changes due to the sale of the seattle property  we will discuss operating results from continuing operations as reported and also discuss certain operating results and data for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis 
comparable hotels are properties that are owned or leased by us for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared 
therefore  the seattle property is excluded from the comparable hotel statistics 

table of contents for the year ended december   our net loss was million per share  which includes non cash  pre tax goodwill and asset impairment charges of million and million respectively and a million pre tax gain on the sale of a hotel 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying amount of the hotel reporting unit exceeded its fair value  which was estimated based on a combined income and market approach 
accordingly  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized in the hotel reporting unit 
further note  this goodwill did not have any tax basis  which results in a permanent difference between book and tax income and the unusual situation of having income tax expense for the year on a book loss 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges of million in continuing operations and million of pre tax asset impairment charges in discontinued operations 
of that amount  million relates to our red lion colonial hotel in helena  montana  million relates to our red lion hotel denver southeast in aurora  colorado and million relates to our red lion hotel vancouver at the quay in vancouver  washington 
the hotels in helena  montana and aurora  colorado are both listed for sale and were written down to their estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell 
the hotel in vancouver  washington is subject to a right of way acquisition by the state to build a replacement of a bridge  and we have determined the carrying value is not recoverable 
the second quarter of included a pre tax gain of million generated by the sale of our seattle property 
during  we reported a net loss of million per share  which includes a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million related to the termination of a franchise and sublease agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we agreed to terminate the franchise and sublease agreement with the operator of the red lion hotel sacramento 
we subsequently entered into an agreement with a new franchisee and subtenant 
as a result of the original contract termination  we recognized an impairment charge of million and a net credit adjustment of million reflecting the recognition of deferred sublease income of million partially offset by million in expenses associated with uncollectible accounts and accrued expenses of the former subtenant 
also included in the net loss is million of expense related to the separation of our former president and chief executive officer

ebitda represents net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation before interest expense  income tax expense benefit and depreciation and amortization 
we utilize ebitda as a financial measure because management believes that investors find it a useful tool to perform more meaningful comparisons of past  present and future operating results and as a means to evaluate the results of core  ongoing operations 
we believe it is a complement to net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation and other financial performance measures 
ebitda is not intended to represent net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  and such information should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  cash flows from operations or any other measure of performance prescribed by gaap 
we use ebitda to measure our financial performance because we believe interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization bear little or no relationship to our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance irrespective of our capital structure or how we finance our properties and operations 
we generally pay federal and state income taxes on a consolidated basis  taking into account how the applicable taxing laws apply to us in the aggregate 
by excluding taxes on income  we believe ebitda provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of our operations excluding factors that our hotels cannot control 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  which can vary from hotel to hotel based on historical cost and other factors unrelated to the hotels financial performance  ebitda measures the financial performance of our hotels without regard to their historical cost 
for all of these reasons  we believe ebitda provides us and investors with information that is relevant and useful in evaluating our business 
however  because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  it does not measure the capital we require to maintain or preserve our fixed assets 
in addition  because ebitda does not reflect interest expense  it does not take into account the total amount of interest we pay on outstanding debt nor does it show trends in interest costs due to changes in our borrowings or changes in interest rates 
ebitda  as defined by us  may not be comparable to ebitda as reported by other companies that do not define ebitda exactly as we define the term 
because we use ebitda to evaluate our financial performance  we reconcile it to net income loss attributable to red lion hotels corporation  which is the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income loss or net income loss determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity

the master lease agreement required minimum monthly payments of million plus contingent rents based on gross receipts from the remaining hotels  of which approximately million per month was paid by the sublease tenant 
on november   we signed an agreement to purchase for million  hotels formerly leased from istar financial inc the hotels purchased in the istar agreement include red lion hotel boise downtowner  red lion inn missoula  red lion inn bend  red lion hotel coos bay  red lion hotel eugene  red lion hotel medford  red lion hotel pendleton  red lion hotel kelso longview  red lion hotel wenatchee  and red 
table of contents lion hotel sacramento at arden village 
the lease expense for these hotels represented million in annual payments which are no longer reflected in the table above 
the red lion hotel vancouver at the quay in vancouver  washington will remain leased under a restated lease with istar as the future of the property rests with the progress of the columbia river crossing bridge project  which will result in the right of way acquisition of the hotel 
we also assigned to an affiliate of istar financial inc the sublease described above with doubletree dtwc corporation whereby doubletree dtwc corporation was subleasing five additional properties from us 
in october  we completed an acquisition of a year including extension periods leasehold interest in a hotel in anaheim  california for million  including costs of acquisition 
at our option  we are entitled to extend the lease for additional terms of five years each  with increases in lease payments tied directly to the consumer price index 
we have exercised the first option to extend for an additional five year term beginning in may at million per year 
the amounts shown in the table above extend through april and reflect this five year extension 
in addition to the above mentioned obligations  we have leasehold interests at our properties in eugene  oregon  the seattle airport and spokane  washington as well as at our corporate headquarters location 
these leases require us to pay fixed monthly rent and have expiration dates of and beyond 
we also assumed an office lease used by guests contracted to stay at our denver southeast hotel 
as part of this contract business  we are reimbursed the entire lease expense amount 
the expense of all of these leases has been included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by sec regulations that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
other matters franchise contracts at december   our system of hotels included hotels under franchise agreements  representing a total of  rooms and  square feet of meeting space 
in june  we sold our seattle property and entered into a franchise agreement with the buyer who will continue to operate the property as a red lion hotel 
we opened the following franchised hotels in red lion hotel oakland international airport in february  red lion inn rancho cordova in may  red lion hotel farmington in september  red lion hotel gallup in september and the red lion hotel grants in october we lost one franchised hotel in due to the bankruptcy of the property owner in concord  california 
we have three franchise license agreements that expire in  and one expiring in each of the years  and seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations  with more revenues and profits realized from may through october than during the rest of the year 
during  revenues during the second and third quarters approximated and  respectively  of total revenues for the year  compared to revenues of and of total revenues during the first and fourth quarters respectively 

table of contents inflation the effect of inflation  as measured by fluctuations in the us consumer price index  has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we consider a critical accounting policy to be one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  however  we have also identified our most critical accounting policies and estimates below 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
revenue recognition and receivables revenue is generally recognized as services are provided 
when we receive payment from customers before our services have been performed  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the service has been completed 
we recognize revenue from the following sources hotels room rental and food and beverage sales from owned and leased hotels 
revenues are recognized when our services have been performed  generally at the time of the hotel stay or guest s visit to the restaurant 
this treatment is consistent with others within our industry 
our revenues are significantly impacted by global  national and regional economic conditions affecting the travel and hospitality industry  as well as the relative market share of our hotels compared with our competitors 
franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of our brand names 
franchise revenues are recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the franchise agreements 
entertainment computerized event ticketing services and promotion of broadway style shows and other special events 
where we act as an agent and receive a net fee or commission  it is recognized as revenue in the period the services are performed 
when we are the promoter of an event and are at risk for the production  revenues and expenses are recorded in the period of the event performance 
other primarily from rental income received from our direct ownership interest in a retail mall in kalispell  montana that is attached to our red lion hotel 
we also own a hotel in sacramento  california that we lease to a franchisee 
we review the ability to collect individual accounts receivable on a routine basis 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible 
a receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection attempts fail 
long lived assets property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires us to make judgments regarding estimated future cash flows from the respective properties  which is dependent upon internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which our cash flows will occur  the determination of real estate market values  
table of contents asset appraisals and  if available and appropriate  current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers or net sales proceeds from previous  comparable transactions 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets  the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings as an asset impairment 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets as events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
changes to our plans  including a decision to sell  dispose of or change the intended use of an asset  could have a material impact on the carrying value of the asset 
during the year ended december   in accordance with the guidance for the impairment of long lived assets  assets held and used with a carrying amount of million were written down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million for the year 
this includes impairment of properties of continuing operations of million and impairment of discontinued operations of million 
to break out the charge by property  million was related to our red lion colonial hotel in helena  montana  million was related to our red lion hotel denver southeast in aurora  colorado  million was related to our red lion hotel vancouver at the quay in vancouver  washington  million was related to our red lion hotel medford in medford  oregon and million was related to our red lion inn missoula in missoula  montana 
four of these five properties are listed for sale and were thus adjusted to their estimated fair market values less costs to sell 
note that the properties in medford and missoula are classified as discontinued operations 
the property in vancouver  washington is not held for sale  but it is subject to a right of way acquisition by the state of washington to allow a replacement of a bridge to be built where the property now exists 
during the year ended december   in accordance with the guidance for the impairment of long lived assets  assets held and used with a carrying amount of million were written down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million for the year 
the full amount of million was related to the termination of a sublease and franchise agreement with the operator of the red lion hotel sacramento 
during the year ended december   in accordance with the guidance for the impairment of long lived assets  assets held and used with a carrying amount of million were written down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million 
of that amount  million was related to our red lion hotel denver southeast 
the remaining million impairment loss related to a second property in astoria  oregon  which is reported in discontinued operations 
to determine estimated fair value  we use level inputs for our discounted cash flow analyses 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available  thereby allowing for situations in which there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date 
level inputs used include growth rate  property level pro forma financial information and remaining lives of the assets 
management bases these assumptions on historical data and experience and future operational expectations 
for certain assets  we use recent asset appraisals or valuations performed by third parties  which we deemed to be level inputs  to support our estimate of fair value 
intangible assets our intangible assets include brands and goodwill  which we do not amortize 
instead  we test for impairment annually or more frequently as events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  subject to the same general assumptions discussed above for long lived assets 
at december  and  our recorded goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization were reported at million and million respectively 

table of contents during  we disposed of goodwill associated with the sale of our seattle property in the amount of million  allocated and impaired million of goodwill related to our property for sale in helena  montana and finally  during our annual impairment testing  we determined that the fair value of our hotel reporting segment was greater than its carrying value resulting in an impairment of all the remaining goodwill in the hotel segment of million 
during  in accordance with the guidance for the impairment of intangible assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the termination of a sublease agreement with the former subtenant of the red lion hotel sacramento 
the lease contract intangible asset for that property was deemed fully impaired as of december  due to the termination of that sublease agreement and current market conditions becoming unfavorable to support the carrying value of the lease contract intangible 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts fair value measurement through our company s estimated weighted average cost of capital used to determine discount rate  and through our common stock price that is used to determine market capitalization 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term move or a longer term trend 
our other intangible assets include marketing and lease contracts  the values of which are amortized on a straight line basis over the weighted average life of the agreements 
new and future accounting pronouncements intangibles goodwill and other in september  the fasb released accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
this standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt this standard in and we do not believe it will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
amendments to fair value measurement in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for our fiscal year beginning on january  and must be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   million of our outstanding debt was subject to currently fixed interest rates and was not exposed to market risk from rate changes 
at december   we also had million outstanding from our revolving credit facility at a floating interest rate of  as well as million outstanding on a term loan at an interest rate of  based on a blend of fixed and variable rates 
on february   we modified our existing credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association  effective december   as follows a financial covenant relating to loan commitment coverage was eliminated 
in lieu thereof  we agreed that borrowings under the facility s revolving line of credit may be limited 
table of contents based on a formula relating to the trailing twelve month consolidated net income of the hotel properties collateralizing the facility 
the financial covenant relating to debt service coverage ratio was eased 
we were relieved of our obligation to offer our hotel in medford  oregon as additional security for the facility and for the period from january  through august   the margins on the interest rate options under the term loan and revolving line of credit were increased i to for borrowings accruing interest by reference to the facility s base rate  and ii to for borrowings accruing interest by reference to libor 
thereafter  the margins will decrease to at most and  respectively  or to as low as and  respectively  if our senior leverage ratio decreases sufficiently 
we paid a fee of  in connection with the modification of the facility 
outside of these changes  we do not foresee any other changes of significance in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  although we will continue to manage our exposure to this risk by monitoring available financing alternatives
