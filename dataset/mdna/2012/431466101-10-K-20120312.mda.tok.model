these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment 
as a result  actual financial results may differ 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price for our common stock could be volatile and could decline  resulting in a substantial or complete loss of your investment 
the stock markets  including the new york stock exchange on which our common stock is listed  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile  and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  actual or anticipated differences in our operating results  changes in our revenue or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts  additions and departures of key personnel  speculation in the press or investment community  actions by institutional stockholders  changes in accounting principles  terrorist acts and other events affecting political  economic or civil conditions in one or more foreign countries in which we operate  and general market conditions  including factors unrelated to our performance 
future sales of our common and preferred stock may depress the price of our common stock 
as of march   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding 
an additional  shares of our common stock may be issued upon the exercise of options held by employees  management and directors 
we also have the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock with terms that are determined by our board of directors and additional options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without stockholder approval 
in addition  we recently registered for issuance of  shares and  shares with the sec 
these shares may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  or used in future acquisitions  respectively  subject to the restrictions of our credit agreement 
sales of a substantial number of these shares in the public market  or factors relating to the terms we may determine for our preferred stock  options or warrants  could decrease the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the perception that such sales might occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
future issuances or sales of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock  you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 
we may retain future earnings  if any  for future operations  expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends 
any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on  among other things  our results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
in addition  our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur  including our revolving credit agreement 
as a result  you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 
we are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock 
our board of directors is authorized to issue one or more series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of our stockholders 
our board of directors also has the power  without stockholder approval  to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and other terms 
if we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or other terms  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock  the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals  could delay or prevent a change in control of the company that our stockholders may consider favorable and could adversely affect the market value of our common stock 
provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals  could delay or prevent a change in control of the company that our stockholders may consider favorable and could adversely affect the market value of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make  alter or repeal our bylaws  our board of directors is divided into three classes of service with staggered three year terms 
this means that only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders  with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective terms  our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  only our board of directors  chairman of the board  our chief executive officer or the holders of a majority in amount of our capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote may call a special meeting of stockholders  this means that minority stockholders cannot force stockholder consideration of a proposal  including a proposal to replace our board of directors  by calling a special meeting of stockholders prior to such time authorized by our board of directors  chairman of the board  our chief executive officer or the holders of a majority in amount of our capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote  our bylaws require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations  our bylaws limit the removal of directors and the filling of director vacancies  and we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that may incur in connection with investigations and legal proceedings resulting from their services to us  which may include services in connection with takeover defense measures 
these provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take specific corporate actions and could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
this provision is applicable to hill and may have an anti takeover effect that may delay  defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in the stockholder s best interest 
in general  section could delay for three years and impose conditions upon business combinations between an interested shareholder and hill  unless prior approval by our board of directors is given 
the term business combination is defined broadly to include mergers  asset sales and other transactions resulting in financial benefit to a stockholder 
an interested shareholder  in general  would be a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns  or within three years  did own  or more of a corporation s voting stock 
a small group of stockholders own a large quantity of our common stock thereby potentially exerting significant influence over the company 
as of december   irvin e 
richter  david l 
richter and other members of the richter family beneficially owned approximately of our common stock 
this concentration of ownership could significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval and could delay  deter or prevent a change in control of the company or other business combinations that might otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders 
accordingly  this concentration of ownership may impact the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the interest of our significant stockholders may not always coincide with the interest of the company s other stockholders 
in deciding how to vote on such matters  they may be influenced by interests that conflict with our other stockholders

overview recent regional civil unrest and global economic conditions  including disruption of certain financial markets  has adversely affected our business and results of operations  primarily by disrupting our clients businesses and limiting our access to credit 
continuation or worsening of general market conditions in the united states or other national economies important to our businesses may adversely affect our clients level of spending  ability to obtain financing  and ability to make timely payments to us for our services  which could require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts  negatively impact days sales outstanding and further adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently have open contracts in libya 
due to the recent political unrest commencing there in february  we suspended our operations in  and demobilized substantially all of our personnel from libya 
we are unable to predict when  or if  the work will resume in libya where we reopened our office in november at december  the accounts receivable related to the work performed under contracts in the region was  we are unable to determine the effect the political and economic uncertainty will have on the collectibility of the accounts receivable 
we believe that the amounts due will be collected  however  if we are unable to do so  there could be a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and liquidity 
despite continuing global economic uncertainty and current limits to financial credit  we remain optimistic about maintaining our current growth strategy to pursue new business development opportunities  continue to take advantage of organic growth opportunities  continue to pursue acquisitions and strengthen our professional resources 
our revenue consists of two components consulting fee revenue cfr and reimbursable expenses 
reimbursable expenses are reflected in equal amounts in both total revenue and total direct expenses 
because these revenue costs are subject to significant fluctuation from year to year  we measure the performance of many of our key operating metrics as a percentage of cfr  as we believe that this is a better and more consistent measure of operating performance than total revenue 
cfr increased  or  from  in to  in cfr for the project management segment increased  principally due to the acquisition of engineering sa  dck and tcm offset by decreases in libya and iraq 
cfr for the construction claims segment increased  due primarily to the full year effect of mll and strong organic growth in the middle east  primarily saudi arabia  and the united states  primarily florida and new jersey 
reimbursable expenses increased  or  from  in to  in principally due to the higher use of subcontractors new york 
cost of services increased  or  from  in to  in as a result of an increase in employees and other direct expenses for the acquired companies  offset by decreases in libya and iraq 
gross profit increased  or  from  in to  in due to the increases in cfr 
gross profit as a percent of cfr decreased from in to in principally due to lower gross profit percentages at engineering sa and the reduced work in libya where percentages were higher than average for the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  principally due to  in expenses at the acquired companies and an increase of  in staff costs in support of expanded operations and growth 
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased  from  in to  in due primarily to the completion of the iraq reconstruction program work for our affiliate  stanley baker hill sbh  in the fourth quarter of income taxes decreased  from  in to  in as our pre tax income decreased  from  in to a loss of  in the effective tax rate was in compared with in net loss attributable to hill was  in compared to net earnings of  in diluted loss per common share was in based upon  diluted common shares outstanding compared to in based upon  diluted common shares outstanding 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make subjective decisions  assessments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the judgment increases  such judgments become even more subjective 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable and appropriate  actual results may be materially different than estimated 
revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from providing professional services to our clients 
revenue is generally recognized upon the performance of services 
in providing these services  we may incur reimbursable expenses  which consist of amounts paid to subcontractors and other third parties as well as travel and other job related expenses that are contractually reimbursable from clients 
we will include reimbursable expenses in computing and reporting our total contract revenue as long as we remain responsible to the client for the fulfillment of the contract and for the overall acceptability of all services provided 
we earn our revenue from cost plus  fixed price and time and materials contracts 
if estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss  we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss becomes known 
the cumulative effect of revisions to revenue  estimated costs to complete contracts  including penalties  incentive awards  change orders  claims  anticipated losses  and other effects are recorded in the accounting period in which the events indicating a loss are known and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
such revisions could occur at any time and the effects may be material 
the majority of our contracts are for work where we bill the client monthly at hourly billing rates 
the hourly billing rates are determined by contract terms 
for governmental clients  the hourly rates are generally calculated as either i a negotiated multiplier of our direct labor costs or ii as direct labor costs plus overhead costs plus a negotiated profit percentage 
for commercial clients  the hourly rates are generally taken from a standard fee schedule by staff classification or they can be at a negotiated discount from this schedule 
in some cases  primarily for foreign work  a fixed monthly staff rate is negotiated rather than an hourly rate 
this monthly rate is determined based upon a buildup of direct labor costs plus overhead and profit 
we account for these contracts on a time and expenses method  recognizing revenue as costs are incurred 
we account for fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion method  wherein revenue is recognized as costs are incurred 
under the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition  we estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to be recognized 
we generally utilize a cost to cost approach in applying the percentage of completion method  where revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred 
under the percentage of completion method  recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of estimates 
we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of contract revenue  the extent of progress towards completion and contract completion costs on our long term construction management contracts 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
estimates used in determining accounts receivable allowances are based on specific client account reviews and historical experience of credit losses 
we also apply judgment including assessments about changes in economic conditions  concentration of receivables among clients and industries  recent write off trends  rates of bankruptcy  and credit quality of specific clients 
unanticipated changes in the financial condition of clients  the resolution of various disputes  or significant changes in the economy could impact the reserves required 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested annually for impairment in our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment 
we have determined that we have two reporting units  the project management unit and the construction claims unit 
we made that determination based on the similarity of the services provided  the methodologies in delivering our services and the similarity of the client base in each of these units 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for hill  the period over which cash flows will occur  and determination of the weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
changes in future market conditions  our business strategy  or other factors could impact upon the future values of hill s reporting units  which could result in future impairment charges 
on july   the company performed its annual impairment test 
based on the results  the company determined that there was no impairment 
during  as one of our assumptions  we utilized a control premium which is in addition to those used in prior years 
we believe that this new assumption is an important element in determining the fair value of our reporting units 
including the use of the control premium  the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values 
we amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and review the long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals  as appropriate  to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
income taxes we make judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws  published tax guidance  as well as estimates of future earnings 
these judgments and interpretations affect the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance 
we evaluated the deferred tax assets and determined on the basis of objective factors that the net assets will be realized through future years taxable income 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates and assessments  additional valuation allowances may be required 
we will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management s assessment is that the position is more likely than not ie  a likelihood greater than percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the term tax position refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods 
stock options we recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards 
the awards include stock options and restricted stock grants 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility  expected life and stock option exercise behavior 
contingencies estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to insurance claims that fall below policy deductibles and to litigation and other legal claims and contingencies  as well as in determining our liabilities for incurred but not reported insurance claims 
significant judgments by us and reliance on third party experts are utilized in determining probable and or reasonably estimable amounts to be recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
the results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which the changes are determined 
we do not believe that material changes to these estimates are reasonably likely to occur
