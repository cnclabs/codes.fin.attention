item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview deltic timber corporation deltic or the company is a natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber 
deltic owns approximately  acres of timberland  mainly in arkansas and north louisiana 
the company s sawmill operations are located at ola in central arkansas the ola mill and at waldo in south arkansas the waldo mill 
deltic is primarily a wood products producer operating in a commodity based business environment  with a major diversification in real estate development in the central arkansas area 
the company also holds a percent interest in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a joint venture to manufacture and market medium density fiberboard mdf 
deltic is a calendar year company for both financial and income tax reporting 
the company is organized into four segments woodlands  which manages all aspects of the timberlands including harvesting and sale of timber  timberland sales and acquisitions  oil and gas mineral revenues  and hunting land leases  mills  which consists of deltic s two sawmills that manufacture a variety of softwood lumber products  real estate  which includes the company s real estate developments and a related country club operation  and corporate  which consists of executive management  accounting  information systems  human resources  purchasing  treasury  income tax  and legal staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units 
the company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units 
the wood products business is affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  employment levels  interest rates  credit availability and associated costs  imports  foreign exchange rates  housing starts  new and existing home inventories  residential and commercial real estate foreclosures  residential repair and remodeling  commercial construction  industry capacity and production levels  the availability of raw materials  cost of fuel  and weather conditions 
concerns over the stability of employment and european sovereign debt  along with high inventory levels of pre existing homes and economic uncertainties  have dampened consumer confidence pertaining to the us housing market 
even though recent economic news in the us has shown the economy to be improving modestly  the us housing market has continued to languish 
until the us housing market can show signs of sustained growth  moving back toward historical levels of annual new home construction  the building products and real estate development markets will continue to be depressed 
given its relative size and the nature of most commodity markets  the company has little or no influence over the market s pricing levels for its wood products 
accordingly  deltic s management focuses on increasing productivity and reducing controllable costs and expenses in its manufacturing processes 
significant accomplishments for the company s operating segments during the year of include the woodlands segment s harvest of  tons of pine sawtimber   tons of pine pulpwood  and sale of approximately  acres of non strategic timberland  the mills segment s reported operating profit for the year  despite continued low lumber prices and consumption levels  and the real estate segment s sales of acres of commercial real estate at an average sales price of  per acre 
the woodlands segment is the company s core operating segment 
it reported operating income of million  a percent decrease from results  primarily due to decreased revenues from harvested sawtimber and pulpwood  as a result of decreased per ton sales prices  combined with sales of fewer acres of timberland at a slightly lower per acre sales price 
offsetting these decreases were increases in the oil and gas and hunting lease revenues  combined with lower operating expenses  net of hauling activities  and a lower cost of timber harvested 
the pine sawtimber harvest volume for was  tons compared to  in  but the average sales price declined percent to per ton  a record low 
the pine pulpwood harvest volume was  tons  a percent increase from  while the per ton average sales price was a percent decrease from the hardwood sawtimber harvest volume decreased percent from  to  tons  and the average sales price was  a percent decrease from the prior year 
the company continues to manage the harvest level of its forests on a sustainable yield basis 

table of contents over the long term  there has been a fundamental correlation between pine lumber prices and pine sawtimber prices  but in the short term  the geographical size differential between the pine lumber and pine sawtimber markets results in the two acting somewhat independently of each other 
pine sawtimber markets operate within local areas  with sales being mainly to sawmills 
these mills are subject to a relatively fixed level of raw material requirements that is driven by the facilities required production levels 
these production levels within a region can influence the price of pine sawtimber 
changes in pricing levels within the lumber market typically do not have an immediate effect on the existing demand for raw materials in the short term  therefore  the resulting impact on pine sawtimber prices will usually lag in timing and will be less volatile than that of the market for pine lumber 
this trend would also be true in the short term during times of a depressed lumber market 
ultimately  the company s ability to sell pine sawtimber at acceptable prices in the future will be dependent upon the size or existence of markets for manufactured lumber and other wood products 
timberland designated as higher and better use consists of tracts with market values that exceed the land s worth as a pine timber growing platform 
deltic s approximately  acre timberland holdings in the expanding westward growth corridor of little rock  arkansas  is an example of such land 
non strategic timberland is composed of hardwood bottomland acreage that is unsuitable for growing pine timber  tracts that are too small to allow efficient timber management  tracts geographically isolated from other company fee lands  or any other acreage not deemed strategic to deltic s operations or growth 
approximately  acres of non strategic timberland  primarily hardwood bottomland  were sold during when possible  the company utilizes tax deferring  like kind exchanges to minimize tax consequences of timberland sales 
in  deltic reinvested hardwood bottomland sale proceeds into pine producing timberland  purchasing approximately  acres 
in addition to pine and hardwood timber sales  the company receives other benefits from land ownership  such as revenues from hunting leases  mineral lease rentals  mineral royalties  and land easements that provide income to the woodlands segment 
the segment reported hunting lease income of million in and million in total mineral revenues  consisting of mineral lease rentals and net oil and gas royalties  were million in  compared to million in the majority of this revenue currently comes from an area known as the fayetteville shale play  an unconventional natural gas reservoir being developed in the state of arkansas 
the company has under lease or held by production approximately  net mineral acres in the fayetteville shale play 
during  the company received net royalty payments of million from the fayetteville shale play  compared to million in the increase was due to more wells being in production when compared to a year ago 
the total of all net oil and gas royalty income  inclusive of the fayetteville shale play  was million in and million in total income from mineral lease rentals was million in and million in the ultimate benefit to deltic from mineral leases remains speculative and unknown to the company and is contingent on the successful completion of producing wells on company lands and the prices received for crude oil and natural gas 
the mills segment reported operating income of million in  despite a weak lumber market 
however  this was an percent decrease from  which was primarily due to a supply side driven shortage of lumber and the resulting increase in lumber prices during the impact of decreased sales prices in was partially offset by a lower average manufacturing cost 
current economic forecasts indicate the housing industry s recovery will be prolonged for some time 
as with any commodity market  the company expects the historical volatility of lumber prices to continue in the future  and management will respond with timely decisions for adjusting production levels to match market demand 
since commodity based markets rarely benefit from real price growth  after inflation  deltic focuses on improving production efficiencies and the cost structure for its lumber mills  as evidenced by a continued year over year unit cost reduction and improved hourly productivity rates in its manufacturing operations 

table of contents the real estate segment reported break even results in  a decrease of million from while the number of residential lots sold increased by to  the average sales price per lot decreased  to  per lot 
the decrease was due to the mix of lots sold  as the company has not reduced lot prices 
at december   developed but uncommitted residential lots in chenal valley  chenal downs  and red oak ridge were   and  respectively 
the company continues to focus on the long term financial returns from the total build out of the chenal valley and red oak ridge developments and deems the recent negative trends to reflect anticipated fluctuation  which will have a minimal impact on the overall real estate business model 
a tabular summary of deltic s residential real estate activity is as follows residential lots lots sold in lots sold since inception unsold developed lots future lots to develop estimated total lots development market chenal valley little rock   chenal downs little rock red oak ridge hot springs  acquired lots various during the year of  deltic sold approximately acres of commercial real estate within the boundaries of the chenal valley development for an average per acre price of  a multi family housing site accounted for of these acres 
future pricing trends for commercial real estate sales are difficult to predict and are influenced by multiple factors  which include intended use of the site  property location  and acres available 
there is no commercial acreage included in the chenal downs development 
red oak ridge  the company s hot springs area development  will include a small amount of commercial acreage to be determined by the actual land usages 
the company will begin to develop and offer commercial sites as this development s population density increases

this activity has been reviewed for potential triggers for impairment testing  as appropriate 
however  management is of the opinion that no such triggering event has occurred

table of contents equity in earnings of del tin fiber was 
million in  a decrease of million from the decrease was due primarily to lower sales volume and average per unit sales price  as the mdf market was weaker than the prior year  as benefitted from a disruption in the supply of moldings from chile as a result of an earthquake there 
in addition  higher costs for raw material used in the manufacture of mdf adversely impacted the plant s financial results 
significant events on february   deltic amended and extended its unsecured and committed revolving credit facility 
pursuant to the amendment  the total amount available was decreased million to million  the term was extended to september   the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant was removed  pricing of the applicable commitment fees and margins was amended  and an option to request an increase in the amount of the aggregate revolving commitments by million was continued 
the funds available through this agreement will enable the company to take full advantage of growth opportunities as they present themselves

outlook deltic s management believes that cash provided from its operations  the remaining amount available under its credit facility  and its ability to access the credit markets will be sufficient to meet its expected cash needs and planned expenditures  including those of the company s continued timberland acquisition and stock repurchase programs  and capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future 

table of contents the preceding discussion of the company s liquidity and capital resources contains forward looking statements which were made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements reflect the company s current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
other matters impact of inflation general inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operating results during the three years ended december  the company s timber operations are more significantly impacted by the forces of supply and demand in the southern united states than by changes in inflation 
lumber manufacturing operations are affected by the supply of lumber available in the north american market and by the demand for lumber by both the north american and foreign export markets 
sales of real estate are affected by changes in the general economy  employment levels  new and existing housing inventories  lending restrictions  and long term interest rates  specifically as such may manifest themselves in the central arkansas region 
market risk market risk represents the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments  either derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity security prices 
the company handles market risks in accordance with its established policies  however  deltic does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company does consider  on occasion  the need to enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates  however  the company entered into no such instruments during the three year period ended december  deltic held various financial instruments at december  and  consisting of financial assets and liabilities reported in the company s consolidated balance sheets and off balance sheet exposures resulting from contractual debt guarantees and letters of credit issued for the benefit of deltic  primarily in connection with its purchased stumpage procurement and real estate operations 
for additional information regarding these financial instruments  refer to the previous tabular summary of the company s other commercial commitment expirations and to note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments  such as term debt and other borrowings 
the fair market value of long term  fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and will decrease as interest rates rise 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the instruments fair value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
the estimated fair values of the company s long term debt  including current maturities  and letters of credit at december  were million  and 
million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in decreases in the estimated fair value of long term debt by million  while the fair value of contractual guarantees and the company s letters of credit would be unchanged 
fair values were determined using the current rates at which the company could enter into comparable financial instruments with similar remaining maturities 
foreign exchange rate risk the company currently has no exposure to foreign exchange rate risk because all of its financial instruments are denominated in us dollars

critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified seven of its current accounting policies as being  in management s view  critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  six of these policies require significant assumptions and or estimates on the part of management as it pertains to certain factors inherent in the policies 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
deltic has not made any material changes to its critical accounting estimates in the last three years 
these policies  along with explanations of the key assumptions and or estimates considered by management  are described below 
for a listing of all significant accounting policies of the company  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment in real estate held for development and sale real estate held for development and sale includes direct costs of land  land development  and indirect costs  including amenities 
indirect and amenity costs are allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative sales value 
direct costs are allocated to the specific neighborhood or commercial real estate tract  while indirect costs for the company s three development areas chenal valley  chenal downs  and red oak ridge are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail values 
management makes the determination of future indirect development costs and the potential future retail value and in so doing considers  among other factors  the cost projections for its development plans provided by independent professional engineering consultants and retail values as provided by independent appraisers 
the key factors involved in determining the investment in real estate held for development and sale are the treatment of the clubhouse and golf courses at chenal country club  the amenity around which the chenal valley development is centered  as an amenity rather than an operating fixed asset and the management estimates required to estimate the future indirect development costs and sales values of the areas of chenal valley yet to be developed 
due to accounting for chenal country club as an amenity  the cost of the clubhouse and golf course  including the estimated cost of planned future improvements  is charged against income as real estate is sold rather than depreciating this cost 
this amenity treatment also records the initiation fees received from members joining the club as a reduction in the cost basis of the club rather than as net sales 
in addition  the company s model for allocating the indirect cost to be expensed against each piece of real estate sold requires management to estimate the future indirect costs to be incurred for the entire development  primarily infrastructure costs and future improvements at chenal country club net of estimated future initiation fees to be received  as well as the potential market value of each tract of undeveloped property within the chenal valley development 
deltic s investment in real estate held for development and sale primarily consists of residential lots  commercial tracts  and undeveloped acreage marketed to others for further development 
deltic periodically evaluates its holdings for indications of conditions that would lead to an impairment analysis as required by accounting for subsequent measurement of property  plant  and equipment 
our investment in real estate is mainly comprised of former legacy timberland and thus has a low cost basis 
margins on deltic s residential real estate average percent  while commercial real estate margins are percent 
the central arkansas area  where deltic s developments are located has one of the more stable housing markets in the country  therefore  deltic has not and does not plan to reduce the current pricing structure for its real estate 
based on these factors  the company does not foresee impairment losses in its real estate held for development or sale 

table of contents investment in del tin fiber investment in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a percent owned limited liability company  is accounted for under the equity method 
the company s carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber is evaluated for possible impairment  as applicable under the requirements of equity method accounting for investments in partnerships  unincorporated joint ventures  and limited liability companies 
this evaluation as of december   based on the intent of the company s board of directors to exit the business  resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december   and the carrying amount of the investment was written off  to zero  for the consolidated balance sheet 
on december   the company s board of directors revised its intent in regard to selling deltic s interest in the joint venture 
the resulting evaluation of fair value for the related investment indicated that fair value exceeded carrying value  which was zero as of december   and the company resumed recording its equity share of the operating results of del tin fiber 
likewise  cash advances to the joint venture are recorded as increases in the company s investment in the facility  while cash distributions received from the joint venture are reflected as reductions in its investment 
for deltic s investment in del tin fiber  the key determinations by management are the accounting treatment for this investment under the equity method of accounting rather than as a consolidated subsidiary since the joint venture is percent owned by both owners  the factors used in evaluating the impairment of the investment s carrying value  and the estimate of the fair value of the company s guarantee of del tin fiber s credit agreement 
deltic management has determined that there is no control by either company due to having a board of managers with equal representation 
as such  the assets and liabilities of del tin fiber are not included in the amounts reported on the company s balance sheet for any period

timber and timberlands timber and timberlands  which includes timberland  fee timber  purchased stumpage inventory  and logging facilities  are stated at cost less cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities and includes no estimated future reforestation cost 
the cost of timber consists of fee timber acquired and reforestation costs  which includes site preparation  seedlings  and reforestation labor 
the cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable 
logging facilities  which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements  are depreciated using the straight line method over a ten year estimated life 
the company estimates its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
fee timber carrying costs  commercial thinning  silviculture  and timberland management costs are expensed as incurred 
the company classifies its timberlands and fee timber as either strategic or non strategic 
strategic timberland  including pine forest and pine plantations  are prime pine sawtimber growing platforms located within or immediately adjacent to the company sawmills operating regions 
deltic manages these acres using modern silviculture methods to achieve optimal volume and quality of its pine sawtimber 
the company harvests sawtimber and pulpwood in accordance with its harvest plans and generally converts sawtimber into lumber in its own sawmills and sells pulpwood in the market 
upon harvest  strategic timberlands are reforested 
the company s timberland acquisition program is focused on the acquisition of timberland in its current operating regions 
the company considers the acquisition and the occasional sale of strategic timberlands as investing activities 
the company has legacy hardwood and other acreage which either cannot be harvested for conversion in company 
table of contents sawmills  reforested as pine plantations  managed efficiently using modern silviculture methods due to the size of the tract or proximity to other deltic fee timberlands  or all three 
these timberlands have been identified as non strategic and or higher and better use timberlands and are expected to be sold over time 
the woodlands segment manages an annual program to sell a portion of these non strategic timberlands and or harvest hardwoods for the sale to third parties 
the company considers this program as an operating activity of its woodlands segment 
in order to acquire and sell assets  primarily timberlands  in a tax efficient manner  the company enters into like kind exchange lke tax deferred transactions 
the company generally enters into forward transactions  in which property is sold and the proceeds are reinvested by acquiring similar property  and reverse transactions  in which property is acquired and similar property is subsequently sold 
a qualified lke intermediary is used to facilitate lke transactions 
proceeds from forward lke transactions are held by the intermediary and are classified as restricted cash because the funds must be reinvested in similar properties 
if the acquisition of suitable lke properties is not completed within days of the sale of the company owned property  the proceeds are distributed to deltic by the intermediary and are reclassified as available cash and applicable income taxes are determined 
amounts deposited with a third party towards the potential future purchase of property are included in other investments and non current receivables in the consolidated balance sheets and as an investing activity shown as funds held by trustee in the consolidated statements of cash flow 
at december   
million of land proceeds was deposited with a lke intermediary and there were no funds at december  an exchange accommodation titleholder  a type of variable interest entity  is used to facilitate reverse like kind exchanges 
the acquired assets are held by the exchange accommodation titleholder until the exchange transactions are complete 
if the company determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the exchange accommodation titleholder  deltic includes the assets held by the exchange accommodation titleholder in timber and timberlands assets on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes any income or expense attributed to the property in the consolidated income statements 
the key components of the timber and timberlands policy are management s decision to maintain separate timber cost pools for each legal entity within the deltic consolidated group and the required estimation of timber inventory volume  by species  for each of these companies in order to calculate the cost of fee timber harvested per ton 
management has elected to maintain a separate cost pool for the timber owned by each company  thus resulting in a different cost per ton for fee timber harvested for each 
the mix of harvest by company for any period can significantly affect the amount of cost of fee timber harvested expense reported 
per ton costs for ranged from to per ton for pine sawtimber 
had the company opted to use a composite depletion rate  cost of pine sawtimber harvested would have been 
million more in  
million less in  and 
million more in  
million  
million  and 
million  respectively  net of applicable income taxes than as reported due to the mix of harvest by company during the year 
in determining these rates  management must estimate the volume of timber existing on its timberlands 
to estimate these fee timber inventories  the company relies on its experienced forestry personnel and their use of statistical information and data obtained by actual physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the recognized cost of fee timber harvested is impacted by the accuracy of this volume estimation 
for additional information about the company s timber and timberlands  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
assets used in the woodlands segment shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the recoverability test is based on undiscounted future cash flows over the expected life of the asset 
impairment recognition and measurement would occur at the lowest level for which we have identifiable cash flows 
at december   the composite basis in fee timber is 
table of contents per ton assuming no future growth 
gross margin on pine sawtimber for  when the average sales price was per ton  was percent 
a harvest cycle  which ranges between and years would be used to evaluate the recoverability of our timber and timberlands 
due to the long life and low basis  the company does not expect to incur impairment loss in the future for its timber and timberland assets 
property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of buildings  equipment  and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight line method 
expenditures that substantially improve and or increase the useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 
gains and losses on disposals or retirements are included in income as they occur 
property  plant  and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets  as applicable  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
management also evaluates any asset or group of assets for which potential impairment might exist and has determined that there are none requiring an impairment write down 
this process requires management s estimate of future cash flows generated by each asset or group of assets 
for any instance where this evaluation process might indicate impairment exists  the appropriate asset s carrying value would be written down to fair value  and the amount of the write down would be charged against the results of continuing operations 
for additional information about the company s property  plant  and equipment  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation the company uses fair value recognition provisions for share based payment transactions 
under the fair value recognition provisions  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
for the valuation of stock options  deltic uses a binomial model to estimate fair value 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
for restricted stock performance units  the monte carlo simulation is used to estimate fair value 
the company recognizes compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
deltic issues restricted stock performance units whose vesting is contingent upon meeting certain financial performance goals based upon the company s total stockholder return compared to the total return of a paper and forest products index the index selected by the compensation committee and calculated by standard and poor s 
determining the appropriate amount to expense is based on likelihood of achievement of the stated goals and requires judgment  including forecasting future financial results 
this estimate may be revised periodically due to changes in awards 
the cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change 
the company uses historical volatility over the ten year trading life of its stock to determine volatility assumptions 
risk free interest rates are based on historical rates and forward looking factors 
the expected dividend yield is based on the company s average dividend yield from to the pre vesting forfeiture rate is based on historical rates and forward looking factors 
the expected option term is based on the term of the option  historical exercise  and expiration experience 

table of contents assumptions for the   and valuation of stock options and restricted stock performance units consisted of the following weighted expected volatility dividend yield expected term of options in years risk free interest rate stock options risk free interest rate restricted stock performance units revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
revenue from the sale of lumber and wood by products is recorded at the time of shipment due to terms of such sale being designated free on board fob shipping point 
revenue from the sale of timber cutting rights to third parties is recorded when legal title passes to the purchaser  which is generally upon delivery of a legally executed timber deed and receipt of payment for the timber 
revenue from intersegment timber sales is recorded when the timber is harvested 
such intersegment sales  which are made at prices which generally approximate market  are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue from timberland and real estate sales is recorded at the time the purchaser executes the real estate closing documents and makes payment to the title company handling the closing 
when oil and gas lease rental agreements are signed and the amounts are received  they are recorded as either short term or long term deferred revenue  and the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the company s share of gross oil and gas royalties are recorded as revenues when received  and any related severance tax or other deductions are included in operating expenses 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities  based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and is measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance when it is established that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the key management decisions related to income taxes are the determination of current taxability of transactions  the election to capitalize or expense costs incurred  the decision regarding the appropriate depreciation method for income tax purposes these three factors ultimately affect the company s cash flows for income taxes paid and determine the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and management s estimation of the appropriateness of valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets that exist 
deltic s management periodically evaluates the company s ability to realize future benefits of deferred tax assets by reviewing the expected turnaround of deferred tax liabilities and the amount of future taxable income and by evaluating tax planning strategies that could possibly be implemented to realize 
table of contents deferred tax assets 
the company maintains liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various uncertain tax positions taken in its tax return 
these liabilities are estimated based on judgment of the probable outcome of the uncertain tax positions and are adjusted periodically based on changing facts and circumstances 
changes to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits could materially affect operating results in the period of change 
related party transactions the company has contracted to provide to del tin fiber a portion of the plant s fiber and wood supply at market prices 
this arrangement benefits del tin fiber by ensuring a portion of its raw material needs while providing the company with a purchaser of residual by products produced by its lumber mills  if needed 
the price that deltic receives for these transactions is a negotiated market price 
during   and  deltic sold del tin fiber approximately million  million  and million each year  respectively  of these residual by products
