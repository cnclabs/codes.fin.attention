item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview the company s business consists of three manufacturing facilities and one r d center 
these facilities primarily manufacture pharmaceutical intermediates  apis and ingredients derived from organic chemistry 
the company also owns a stake in zenara  a pharmaceutical company with final dosage form manufacturing capabilities based in india  and iep  a business that designs and licenses biocatalytic enzymes based in germany 
the following significant events  which are explained in detail on the following pages  occurred during sales in increased to  from  in foreign currency exchange favorably impacted sales 
debt  net of cash  decreased  during operating profit increased to  from the company entered into a  five year syndicated senior revolving credit facility 
excluding foreign currency  the main drivers of the higher sales include higher volumes of an api to a customer who experienced a disruption in its supply chain for most of  increased volumes for a recently approved product and increased demand for an api manufactured under a long term supply agreement 
these increases were partially offset by lower pricing across several product categories  lower revenue from clinical phase projects and lower sales of a product that was discontinued by a customer of the company in december the company also experienced higher generic api sales due to higher volumes partially offset by competitive pricing 
sales of controlled substances  which the company defines as drugs falling under schedule ii of the us drug enforcement agency s classification system  showed continued growth in gross margins in decreased to compared to in excluding a unfavorable impact from foreign currency  gross margins increased to in versus excluding the foreign currency impact  gross margins were positively impacted by higher production volumes  leading to increased plant efficiency  and favorable product mix  partially offset by lower pricing in  and the result of the benefits in for insurance proceeds related to a business interruption claim and fees related to the cancellation of a supply contract 
the company reported income from continuing operations of  or per diluted share in  compared to  or per diluted share in critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management under each applicable circumstance 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the differences could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows dollars in thousands  except per share data 
index revenue recognition revenues are generally recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
the company has certain contracts that contain multiple deliverables 
these deliverables often include process development services and commercial production and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
the consideration the company receives is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling price the relative selling price method 
when applying the relative selling price method  the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise  third party evidence tpe of selling price is used 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable  the company uses it best estimate of selling price for that deliverable 
once the accounting units are defined  applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
the company elected to early adopt the provisions of this standard  on a prospective basis  for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
for contracts that contain milestone based payments  the company recognizes revenue using the proportional performance method based on the percentage of costs incurred relative to the total costs estimated to be incurred to complete the contract 
revenue recognition computed under this methodology is compared to the amount of non refundable cash payments received or contractually receivable at the reporting date and the lesser of the two amounts is recognized as revenue at each reporting date 
the proportional performance methodology applied by the company for revenue recognition utilizes an input based measure  specifically labor costs  because the company believes the use of an input measure is a better surrogate of proportional performance than an output based measure  such as milestones 
amounts billed in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
since payments received are typically non refundable  the termination of a contract by a customer prior to its completion could result in an immediate recognition of deferred revenue relating to payments already received but not previously recognized as revenue 
sales terms to certain customers include rebates if certain conditions are met 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
the company estimates these rebates and returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience and recognizes revenue net of these estimated costs which are classified as allowances and rebates 
the company bills a portion of freight cost incurred on shipments to customers 
amounts billed to customers are recorded within net revenues 
freight costs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments the review of long lived assets  principally fixed assets and other amortizable intangibles  requires the company to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows generated from these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying value  the long lived assets are written down to fair value 
the review of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is conducted annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable utilizing a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model and compared to the carrying value 
if such analysis indicates that impairment may exist  the company then estimates the fair value of the other assets and liabilities utilizing appraisals and discounted cash flow analyses to calculate an impairment charge 
dollars in thousands  except per share data 
index the determination of fair value is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows primarily based on operating plans  discount rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and perpetual growth rates 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
environmental and litigation contingencies the company periodically assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s current environmental and litigation matters  reserves recorded and its position with respect to any related uncertainties 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that the company will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
if probable and estimable  the company accrues for the costs of clean up  settlements and legal fees 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation and environmental matters  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions that the company may have made with respect to their resolution from time to time 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdictions to utilize the deferred tax assets 
when the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company s valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign tax credits  alternative minimum tax credits  and other net deferred tax balances  excluding deferred tax liabilities on indefinite lived intangibles  in the us  where profitability is uncertain  and nol carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income or where future profitability is uncertain 
employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees  including pensions  post employment benefits and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  turnover rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording obligations under its plans are reasonable 
the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is selected by projecting cash flows associated with plan obligations which are matched to a yield curve of high quality bonds 
the company then selects the single rate that produces the same present value as if each cash flow were discounted by the corresponding spot rate on the yield curve

the company recorded tax expense of  in compared to  in the tax expense for and includes benefits of and  respectively  for changes in valuation allowances to offset expense and benefit generated from domestic income  tax credits  and losses in certain foreign jurisdictions 
these valuation allowances result from the company s recent history of domestic and certain foreign losses and its short term projections for losses in the relative jurisdictions 
since  the company has maintained a full valuation allowance on the tax benefits arising from domestic pre tax losses 
the company will continue to record a full valuation allowance  primarily on its domestic net deferred tax assets excluding indefinite lived intangibles  until an appropriate level of domestic profitability is sustained or tax strategies can be developed that would enable the company to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of the domestic net deferred tax assets would be realized 
if the company continues to report pre tax losses in certain foreign jurisdictions  income tax benefits associated with those losses will not be recognized and  therefore  those losses would not be reduced by such income tax benefits 
the carryforward periods for domestic federal foreign tax credits  research and experimentation tax credits and alternative minimum tax credits are years  years and an indefinite period  respectively 
as such  improvements in domestic pre tax income in the future may result in these tax benefits ultimately being realized 
however  there is no assurance that such improvements will be achieved 
in  a subsidiary of the company was examined by a european tax authority  who challenged the business purpose of the deductibility of certain intercompany transactions from in the fourth quarter of  the tax authorities notified the company that they disagreed with the company s responses to the authority s two formal assessments

the first court date related to this matter was held in june the court issued its ruling in favor of the company in june  however  this ruling has been appealed by the tax authorities and only applies to the smaller of the two assessments made by the authorities related to this matter 
the company still believes this dispute to be in the early stages of the judicial process since any ruling reached by any of the courts may be appealed  and as such the final date of resolution and outcome of this matter are uncertain at this time 
however  within the next twelve months it is possible that factors such as new developments  judgments or settlements may require the company to increase its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits by up to  or decrease its reserve by  including interest and penalties 
if the court rules against the company in subsequent court proceedings  a payment of between  and  including interest and penalties will be due immediately while the case is appealed 
the company has analyzed these issues in accordance with guidance on uncertain tax positions and believes at this time that its reserves are adequate  and intends to vigorously defend itself

see the risk factors section of this document for further explanation of factors that may negatively impact the company s cash flows 
any change in the current status of these factors could adversely impact the company s ability to fund operating cash flow requirements 
market risks currency risk management the company s primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by international operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  euro and swedish krona 
the company currently uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company s local operating results 
as a matter of policy  the company does not hedge to protect the translated results of foreign operations 
the notional amount of these contracts as of december  was  unrealized foreign exchange contract losses do not subject the company s actual results to risk as gains or losses on these contracts are undertaken to offset gains or losses on the transactions that are hedged 
the foreign exchange contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding twelve months 
dollars in thousands  except per share data 
index with respect to the contracts outstanding at december   a fluctuation of the local currency over a one year period would cause  pre tax earnings to be at risk 
this is based on the notional amount of the contracts  adjusted for unrealized gains and losses  of  these calculations do not include the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would offset the gains and losses of the derivative instruments 
interest rate management the company previously employed a plan to mitigate interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements to convert floating rates to fixed interest rates 
during  the company had three interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional value of  at an average fixed rate of 
these interest rate swaps matured in october at december   the company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding and would record higher interest expense if interest rates were to rise 
the company is evaluating potentially entering into floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps for existing borrowings 
contingencies the company is subject to various investigations  claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities 
the company continually assesses all known facts and circumstances as they pertain to all legal and environmental matters and evaluates the need for reserves and disclosures as deemed necessary based on these facts and circumstances 
these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operating results and cash flows in a future reporting period 
environmental in connection with laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment  the company and its subsidiaries are a party to several environmental proceedings and remediation investigations and cleanups and  along with other companies  have been named a prp for certain waste disposal sites superfund sites 
additionally  the company has retained the liability for certain environmental proceedings associated with discontinued operations 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters where remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
such liabilities are based on the company s best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably against the company 
the resolution of such matters often spans several years and frequently involves regulatory oversight or adjudication 
additionally  many remediation requirements are fluid and are likely to be affected by future technological  site and regulatory developments 
consequently  the ultimate liability with respect to such matters  as well as the timing of cash disbursements cannot be determined with certainty 
in matters where the company has been able to reasonably estimate its liability  the company has accrued for the estimated costs associated with the study and remediation of applicable sites not owned by the company and the company s current and former operating sites 
these reserves were  and  at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the reserve includes adjustments to reserves of  partially offset by payments of  and the impact of currency translation of the reserves are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical  regulatory or legal information become available 
based upon available information and analysis  the company s current reserve represents management s best estimate of the probable and estimable costs associated with environmental proceedings including amounts for investigation fees where full remediation costs may not be estimable at the reporting date 
given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws  regulations  enforcement  policies  the impact of other prps  technology and information related to individual sites  the company does not believe it is possible to currently develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of its reserves
