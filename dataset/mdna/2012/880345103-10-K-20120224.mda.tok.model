our retirement benefit plans  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  require us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
our plan obligations totaled million as of december  contributions to the various plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the market performance of plan assets  if any  and future changes in interest rates  which impact the actuarial measurement of plan obligations

newly issued accounting guidance fair value measurements and disclosures in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance for fair value measurements providing common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
while the guidance is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles in us gaap  it expands existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments 
key additional disclosures include quantitative disclosures about unobservable inputs in level measures  qualitative information about sensitivity of level measures and valuation process  and classification within the fair value hierarchy for instruments where fair value is only disclosed in the footnotes but carrying amount is on some other basis 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income that will require us to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to this standard which defers the requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements 
this guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  this amended guidance will not impact our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents testing goodwill for impairment in september  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
this updated accounting guidance permits companies to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if a company determines through this qualitative analysis that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  it is not necessary to perform the two step impairment test 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december   however early adoption is permitted 
we elected to early adopt this guidance for the annual fiscal year ended december  the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
offsetting assets and liabilities disclosures in december  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance on disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
this update adds certain additional disclosure requirements about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to netting arrangements 
the new disclosures are required for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record a reserve for accounts receivable that are potentially uncollectible 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to trade receivables 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to these customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
bad debt write offs as a percentage of net sales were approximately in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved against accounts receivable for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserves we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of inventory or fair market value through the establishment of a reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
reserve requirements are developed by comparing our inventory levels to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand  market conditions and technological and product life cycle changes 
it is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there are significant declines in demand for certain products 
this reserve creates a new cost basis for these products and is considered permanent 
as of december   we had million reserved against inventories 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and is allocated to our reporting units at the time of the acquisition 
we analyze goodwill on an annual basis and when an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of one of our reporting units below its carrying amount 
a goodwill impairment loss occurs if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
beginning in  we performed an analysis of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
prior to  the analysis of qualitative factors was not an option and the two step impairment testing was performed 
the first step is used as an indicator to identify if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the first step indicates there may be an impairment  the second step is performed which measures the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any 
we perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of year end and use our judgment to develop assumptions for the discounted cash flow model that we use 
management assumptions include forecasting revenues and margins  estimating capital expenditures  depreciation  amortization and discount rates 
if our goodwill impairment testing resulted in one or more of our reporting units carrying amount exceeding its fair value  we would write down our reporting units carrying amount to its fair value and would record an impairment charge in our results of operations in the period such determination is made 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment charges is not permitted 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million 
each of our reporting units were analyzed for impairment as of december  and based upon our analysis  the estimated fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts 
we had goodwill of million as of december  warranty reserves we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to net sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  new product introductions and other factors 
future claims experience could be materially different from prior results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  or manufacturing changes that could impact product quality 
in the event we determine that our current or future product repair and replacement costs exceed our estimates  an adjustment to these reserves would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved for future estimated warranty costs 

table of contents income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions 
we also establish reserves for uncertain tax matters that are complex in nature and uncertain as to the ultimate outcome 
although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we consider our ability to ultimately prevail in defending these matters when establishing these reserves 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
we believe that our current reserves are adequate 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns  and some differences will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years but have already been recorded as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  based on management s judgment  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation reserve against those deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be materially different from actual results because of changes in the mix of future taxable income  the relationship between book and taxable income and our tax planning strategies 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million was recorded against foreign tax loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards 
cautionary factors relevant to forward looking information this annual report on form k  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item  contain certain statements that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate  believe  project  or continue or similar words or the negative thereof

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we are subject to exposures resulting from potential cost increases related to our purchase of raw materials or other product components 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to manage our exposures to changes in commodity prices such as steel  oil  gas  lead and other commodities 
various factors beyond our control affect the price of oil and gas  including but not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  domestic and foreign governmental regulation  weather related factors and the overall economic environment 
we purchase petroleum related component parts for use in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  our freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales and service vehicle fuel costs are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas 
increases in worldwide demand and other factors affect the price for lead  steel and related products 
we do not maintain an inventory of raw or fabricated steel or batteries in excess of near term production requirements 
as a result  increases in the price of lead or steel can significantly increase the cost of our lead and steel based raw materials and component parts 
during  our raw materials and other purchased component costs were unfavorably impacted by commodity prices although we are able to somewhat mitigate these higher costs with pricing actions and cost reduction activities 
we continue to focus on mitigating the risk of continued future raw material or other product component cost increases through product pricing  negotiations with our vendors and cost reduction actions 
the success of these efforts will depend upon our ability to increase our selling prices in a competitive market and our ability to achieve cost savings 
if the commodity prices increase significantly and we are not able to offset the increases with higher selling prices  our results may be unfavorably impacted in foreign currency exchange risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to exposures resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the euro  australian and canadian dollars  british pound  japanese yen  chinese yuan and brazilian real against the us dollar 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies to us dollars  the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between tennant operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses 
in addition to the direct financial impact  foreign currency exchange has an indirect financial impact on our results  including the effect on sales volume within local economies and the impact of pricing actions taken as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
because a substantial portion of our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger us dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize the earnings effects associated with foreign exchange rate changes on certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we periodically enter into various contracts  principally forward exchange contracts  to protect the value of certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on these contracts generally approximate changes in the value of the related assets and liabilities 
we had forward exchange contracts outstanding in the notional amounts of million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the potential for material loss in fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding and the related underlying exposures as of december   from a adverse change is unlikely due to the short term nature of our forward contracts 
our policy prohibits us from entering into transactions for speculative purposes 
other matters management regularly reviews our business operations with the objective of improving financial performance and maximizing our return on investment 
as a result of this ongoing process to improve financial performance  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future which  if taken  could be material to our financial results
