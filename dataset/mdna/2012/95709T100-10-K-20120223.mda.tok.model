executive summary description of business we are the largest electric utility in kansas 
we produce  transmit and sell electricity at retail to approximately  customers in kansas under the regulation of the kcc 
we also supply electric energy at wholesale to municipalities and electric cooperatives in kansas under the regulation of ferc 
we have contracts for the sale  purchase or exchange of wholesale electricity with other utilities 
in addition  we engage in energy marketing and purchase and sell electricity in areas outside of our retail service territory 
summary of significant items following is a summary of our net income and basic eps for the years ended december  and year ended december  change dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income attributable to common stock earnings per common share  basic the increases shown in the above table were due principally to the reversal of million of previously accrued liabilities as a result of the legal settlements discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings  and our having recorded a million gain on the sale of a non utility investment 
see the discussion under operating results below for additional factors that affected our net income attributable to common stock for the year ended december  following is a summary of significant items relating to our operations for the year ended december  we believe improving economic conditions are why some of our industrial customers experienced increased production during  which resulted in more electricity sales to them 
as a result  industrial electricity sales increased in in addition  as measured by cooling degree days  the weather in was about warmer than in and warmer than the year average 
warmer weather typically results in more electricity sales to residential and  to a lesser extent  commercial and industrial customers 
however  we believe energy efficiency measures  energy conservation and a lack of retail customer growth partially offset some of the impact of the aforementioned factors as total retail electricity sales increased just in our retail customer count for was essentially flat to that of we made capital expenditures of million during see liquidity and capital resources below for additional information  and westar energy delivered approximately million shares of common stock for proceeds of approximately million as settlement of forward sale transactions entered into in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  common and preferred stock  for additional information 

table of contents key factors affecting our performance the principal business  economic and other factors that affect our operations and financial performance include weather conditions  the economy  customer conservation efforts  the performance  operation and maintenance of our electric generating facilities and networks  conditions in the fuel  wholesale electricity and energy markets  rate and other regulations and costs of addressing public policy initiatives including environmental regulations  the availability of and our access to liquidity and capital resources  and capital market conditions 
strategy we expect to continue operating as a vertically integrated  regulated  electric utility 
we strive to optimize flexibility in our planning and operations to be able to respond to uncertain and changing conditions 
significant elements of our strategy include maintaining a flexible and diverse energy supply portfolio 
in doing so  we are making environmental upgrades to our coal fired power plants  developing renewable generation  and building and upgrading transmission facilities  in addition to developing systems and programs to help customers use energy more efficiently 
following is a summary of recent progress we have made on significant elements of our strategy 
during  we invested million at our power plants to reduce regulated emissions 
we have entered into two separate agreements with third parties to purchase under year supply contracts renewable energy produced from approximately mw of wind generation beginning in late these contracts  along with our prior development of wind generation  will provide for approximately mw of total wind generation  which satisfies present statutory requirements 
in late  we began installing advanced metering infrastructure for smartstar lawrence 
the project will enable customers to better monitor their energy use 
we qualified to receive a matching grant of approximately million from the doe 
we expect to complete equipment installation in early and anticipate total project costs of approximately million 
our plans and expectations for and beyond are as follows 
we plan to invest approximately billion at our power plants over the next three years to reduce regulated emissions 
we expect to complete construction of a mile kv transmission line in south central kansas in mid prairie wind transmission  llc  a joint venture company of which we own  has under development miles of transmission facilities running from near wichita  kansas  southwest to a location near medicine lodge  kansas  and then south to the oklahoma border 
the project is scheduled for completion in in addition to the transmission lines described above  subject to regulatory approvals  we intend to make further investments to strengthen and improve kansas electrical transmission network 
current trends environmental regulation environmental laws and regulations affecting power plants  which relate primarily to discharges into the air  air quality  discharges of effluents into water  the use of water  and the handling  disposal and clean up of hazardous and non hazardous substances and wastes  continue to evolve and have become more stringent and costly over time 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures  and may potentially need to limit the use of some of our power plants  to comply with existing and new environmental laws and regulations 
while certain of these costs are recoverable through the ecrr  and ultimately we expect that all such costs will be reflected in the prices we are allowed to charge customers  we cannot assure that all such costs will be recovered in a timely manner 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  for additional information regarding environmental laws and regulations 

table of contents air emissions the operation of power plants results in emissions of pm  mercury and other air toxics 
in december  the epa finalized mats for power plants  which replaces the prior federal camr and requires significant reductions in emissions of mercury and other air toxics 
companies impacted by the new standards will have up to four years  and in certain limited circumstances up to five years  to comply 
we are currently evaluating the new standards and cannot at this time determine the impact they may have on our operations and consolidated financial results  but we believe the cost of compliance could be material 
in july  the epa finalized csapr which requires states  including kansas  missouri and oklahoma  to further reduce power plant emissions of so and nox 
under csapr  reductions in annual so and nox emissions were required to begin january   with further reductions required beginning january  the epa issued federal implementation plans for each state covered by csapr  but would allow these states to submit their own implementation plans starting as early as in october  the epa issued a proposed amendment to csapr that  according to the epa  would slightly ease the new emission standards and defer the effective date of certain penalty provisions from january   to january  in december  the epa published a final supplemental rule to csapr requiring five states to make summertime reductions in nox emissions under an ozone season control program implemented under csapr 
reductions in ozone season nox under this rule begin may  although kansas was included in the original proposed rule  the final supplemental rule instead calls for the epa to revisit kansas status under this supplemental rule once kansas submits an ozone state implementation plan  which must occur within to months from the date the epa issues a state implementation call to kansas 
the epa has not yet issued such a call 
in october  we filed legal challenges to csapr in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
on december   the court issued its ruling to stay csapr  including the final supplemental rule  pending judicial review  which delays csapr s implementation date beyond january  the court is scheduled to hear the cases starting in april under this timeframe  the court could issue its decision by summer or early fall as the outcome of the judicial review and any other possible legal or congressional challenges are uncertain  we are unable to determine what impact csapr may ultimately have on our operations and consolidated financial results  but it could be material

risk factors for additional information 
greenhouse gases under epa regulations finalized in may  known as the tailoring rule  the epa is regulating ghg emissions from certain stationary sources 
the regulations are being implemented pursuant to two federal clean air act programs the title v operating permit program and the program requiring a permit if undergoing construction or major modifications  which is referred to as psd 
obligations relating to title v permits include recordkeeping and monitoring requirements 
with respect to psd permits  projects that cause a significant increase in ghg emissions currently defined to be more than  tons or more per year or  tons or more per year  depending on various factors  are required to implement bact 
the epa has issued guidance on what bact entails for the control of ghgs and individual states are now required to determine what controls are required for facilities within their jurisdiction on a case by case basis 
the epa is expected to issue a proposed rule in that may reduce the  and  ton thresholds noted above 
we cannot at this time determine the impact of these regulations on our operations and consolidated financial results  but we believe the costs to comply with the regulations could be material 
in december  the epa announced that it would be proposing ghg nsps rules for egus and refineries 
the rules will apply to new and existing facilities 
the epa had announced that it would propose the new rules by september   but has postponed the proposed rules for new and modified egus 
it is unclear when the epa will propose new rules for existing egus and how stringent they may be  but the rules are expected 
because these regulations have yet to be proposed or finalized  we cannot predict the impact they may have on our operations or consolidated financial results  but it could be material 

table of contents regulation of coal combustion byproducts in the course of operating our coal generation plants  we produce ccbs  including fly ash and bottom ash  which we must handle  dispose  recycle or process 
we recycle some of our fly ash and bottom ash production  principally by selling to the aggregate industry 
this is referred to as beneficial use 
in june  the epa proposed a rule to regulate ccbs under rcra 
the proposed rule provides two possible options for ccb regulation  both of which technically would allow for the continued beneficial use of ccbs  but we believe might actually curtail or impair beneficial use to the extent we are able to recycle it today 
the first option would subject ccbs to regulation as special waste under subtitle c of rcra when disposed of in landfills or surface impoundments 
the second option would regulate ccbs as non hazardous solid waste under subtitle d of rcra 
the epa is expected to issue a final rule in while we cannot at this time estimate the impact and costs associated with future regulations of ccbs  we believe the impact on our operations and consolidated financial results could be material 
national ambient air quality standards under the federal clean air act  the epa sets naaqs for six criteria emissions considered harmful to public health and the environment  including pm  nox  co and so  which result from coal combustion 
areas meeting the naaqs are designated attainment areas while those that do not meet the naaqs are considered nonattainment areas 
each state must develop a plan to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs 
naaqs must be reviewed by the epa at five year intervals 
in  kdhe proposed to designate portions of the kansas city area nonattainment for the hour ozone standard  which has the potential to impact our operations 
in  the epa strengthened the naaqs for both nox and so we are currently evaluating what impact this could have on our operations 
if we are required to install additional equipment to control emissions at our facilities  the revised naaqs could have a material impact on our operations and consolidated financial results 
pm  principally ash  is a byproduct of coal combustion 
the epa is currently reviewing the pm naaqs 
we cannot at this time predict the impact of this review and any possible new standards on our operations or consolidated financial results  but it could be material 
the epa had been in the process of revising the naaqs for ozone 
however  in september  the president of the united states ordered the epa to withdraw its proposal 
work is currently underway to support the epa s planned reconsideration of the standards in wastewater effluent some water used in our operations is discharged as wastewater effluent 
this wastewater may contain substances deemed to be pollutants 
the epa plans to propose revisions to the rules governing such wastewater effluent from coal fired power plants by july with final action on the proposed rules expected to occur by january although we cannot at this time determine the impact of any new regulations  more stringent regulations could have a material impact on our operations and consolidated financial results 
in april  the epa issued a proposed rule that would set stricter technology standards for cooling water intake structures at power plants 
we are currently evaluating the proposal 
the epa is expected to finalize the proposal in  however  because the rule has yet to be finalized  we cannot predict the impact it may have on our operations or consolidated financial results  but it could be material 
renewable energy standard kansas law mandates that our capacity consists of a certain amount of renewable sources 
in years through net renewable generation capacity must be of the average peak demand for the three prior years  subject to limited exceptions 
this requirement increases to for years through and for and thereafter 
we met the requirement using our existing approximately mw of qualifying wind generation facilities along with renewable energy credits 
beginning in late  we will purchase under year supply contracts the renewable energy produced from an additional approximately mw of wind generation  which will allow us to satisfy the net renewable generation requirement through and contribute toward meeting the increased requirements beginning in if we are unable to meet future requirements  our operations and consolidated financial results could be adversely impacted 

table of contents regulation of nuclear generating station additional regulation of wolf creek resulting from nrc oversight of the plant s performance or from changing regulations generally  including those that could potentially result from natural disasters or any event that might occur at any nuclear power plant anywhere in the world  may result in increased operating and capital expenditures 
we cannot estimate the cost associated with such increases  but they could be material to our operations and consolidated financial results 
in march  the nrc established a task force to conduct a review of us nuclear power plant safety in the aftermath of an earthquake and tsunami that eventually resulted in station blackout and a very serious event at japan s fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant 
the task force has provided a report and proposed improvements to the nrc which has the responsibility for making decisions regarding the task force recommendations 
the timing and effects of any nrc action with respect to regulations  safety initiatives and licensing process cannot be determined at this time 
allowance for funds used during construction allowance for funds used during construction afudc represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity 
we compute afudc by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress 
we credit other income for equity funds and interest expense for borrowed funds for the amount of afudc capitalized as construction cost on the accompanying consolidated statements of income as follows year ended december  in thousands borrowed funds equity funds total average afudc rates we expect afudc for both borrowed funds and equity funds to fluctuate over the next several years as we execute our capital expenditure program 
interest expense we expect interest expense to increase over the next several years as we issue new debt securities to fund our capital expenditure program 
we believe this increase will be reflected in the prices we are permitted to charge customers  as cost of capital will be a component of future rate proceedings and is also recognized in some of the other rate adjustments we are permitted to make 
in addition  short term interest rates are extremely low by historical standards 
we cannot predict to what extent these conditions will persist 
outstanding shares of common stock we expect the number of outstanding shares of westar energy common stock to increase over the next several years as we issue additional shares to fund our capital expenditure program 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  common and preferred stock  for additional information regarding our share issuances 
customer growth and usage residential customer additions have slowed due principally to the effects of the economic downturn 
absent an economic recovery to conditions similar to those preceding the downturn  we believe such additions will continue to be significantly lower than historical levels 
in addition  with the numerous energy efficiency policy initiatives promulgated through federal  state and local governments  as well as industry  we believe customers will continue to adopt more energy efficiency and conservation measures which will suppress the rate of demand for electricity 

table of contents outlook in  we expect to maintain our current business strategy and regulatory approach 
subject to regulatory approvals  we anticipate price increases in the form of formulae that track changes in certain of our costs  and expect a decision from the kcc regarding our general rate review as discussed under other information below 
as we have no way of predicting the weather  we assume for planning purposes normal weather in line with its historical average  which means for that we anticipate lower residential and commercial electricity sales than in we expect a slight increase in industrial electricity sales under the assumption that economic conditions will continue to improve and because industrial customers generally are less affected by weather 
we expect retail customer growth in to be below the long term historical average 
in addition  we anticipate higher operating and maintenance expense  including maintenance costs for our power plants  and higher selling  general and administrative expenses  some of which will be offset in revenues 
we plan to contribute million to our pension and post retirement benefit plans and wolf creek s pension plan in to help fund our increased capital spending as provided under future cash requirements below  we plan to issue long term debt in addition to utilizing commercial paper and revolving credit facilities 
moreover  we expect a decision from the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit regarding csapr  which is discussed under current trends above 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management 
the policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or their susceptibility to change 
regulatory accounting we currently apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation 
accordingly  we have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in our prices 
regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
the deferral of costs as regulatory assets is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable 
in assessing probability  we consider such factors as specific regulatory orders  regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment 
were we to deem it no longer probable that we would recover such costs  we would record a charge against income in the amount of the related regulatory assets 
as of december   we had recorded regulatory assets currently subject to recovery in future prices of approximately billion and regulatory liabilities of million  as discussed in greater detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  rate matters and regulation 
pension and post retirement benefit plans actuarial assumptions we and wolf creek calculate our pension benefit and post retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by applicable gaap 
in accounting for our retirement plans and post retirement benefits  we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the reported costs of our pension plans are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets  contributions to the plan  discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs  and employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods 
changes in these assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets  regulatory liabilities or the amount of related pension and post retirement benefit liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
such changes may also require cash contributions 

table of contents the following table shows the impact of a change in our pension plan discount rate  salary scale and rate of return on plan assets 
actuarial assumption change in assumption change in projected benefit obligation a annual change in projected pension costs a dollars in thousands discount rate decrease increase salary scale decrease increase rate of return on plan assets decrease increase a increases or decreases due to changes in actuarial assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets and liabilities 
the following table shows the impact of a change in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets and a change in the annual medical trend on our post retirement benefit plans 
actuarial assumption change in assumption change in projected benefit obligation a annual change in projected post retirement costs a dollars in thousands discount rate decrease increase rate of return on plan assets decrease increase annual medical trend decrease increase a increases or decreases due to changes in actuarial assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition electricity sales we record revenue at the time we deliver electricity to customers 
we determine the amounts delivered to individual customers through systematic monthly readings of customer meters 
at the end of each month  we estimate how much electricity we have delivered since the prior meter reading and record the corresponding unbilled revenue 

table of contents our unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand  weather  line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes 
we recorded estimated unbilled revenue of million as of december   and million as of december  energy marketing contracts we account for energy marketing derivative contracts under the fair value method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize changes in the portfolio value as gains or losses in the period of change 
with the exception of certain fuel supply and electricity contracts  which we record as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities  we include the net change in fair value in revenues on our consolidated statements of income 
we record the unrealized gains and losses as current energy marketing assets and liabilities or in other assets and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as appropriate 
we use quoted market prices to value our energy marketing derivative contracts when such data are available 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  we use alternative approaches  such as model pricing 
the prices we use to value these transactions reflect our best estimate of the fair value of these contracts 
results actually achieved from these activities could vary materially from intended results and could affect our consolidated financial results 
the following table shows the net fair value of energy marketing contracts outstanding as of december  fair value of contracts in thousands net fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  a contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period that were realized or otherwise settled during the period changes in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning and end of the period fair value of new contracts entered into during the period net fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  b a approximately million of the fair value of energy marketing contracts was recognized as a regulatory liability 
b approximately million and million of the fair value of energy marketing contracts were recognized as a regulatory asset and regulatory liability  respectively 
the sources of the fair values of the financial instruments related to these contracts and the maturity periods of the contracts as of december   are summarized in the following table fair value of contracts at end of period sources of fair value total fair value maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity over years dollars in thousands prices provided by other external sources swaps and forwards prices based on option pricing models options and other a total fair value of contracts outstanding a options are priced using a series of techniques  such as the black option pricing model 

table of contents normal purchases and normal sales exception determining whether a contract qualifies for the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires that we exercise judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that we ensure compliance with all of the associated qualification and documentation requirements 
revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify as normal purchases and normal sales are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed 
contracts which qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception are those for which physical delivery is probable  quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and price is not tied to an unrelated underlying derivative 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
we recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties as required by tax laws and regulatory practices 
we recognize production tax credits in the year that electricity is generated to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we record deferred tax assets to carry forward into future periods capital losses  operating losses and tax credits 
however  when we believe based on available evidence that we do not  or will not  have sufficient future capital gains or taxable income in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction to realize the entire benefit during the applicable carryforward period  we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
the application of income tax law is complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous 
accordingly  we must make judgments regarding income tax exposure 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a result  changes in our judgments can materially affect amounts we recognize in our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  taxes  for additional detail on our accounting for income taxes 
asset retirement obligations legal liability we have recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of such assets 
concurrent with the recognition of the liability  the estimated cost of the asset retirement obligation aro is capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset 
we estimate our aros based on the fair value of the aros we incurred at the time the related long lived assets were either acquired  placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective 
we initially recorded aros at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission wolf creek our share  retire our wind generating facilities  dispose of asbestos insulating material at our power plants  remediate ash disposal ponds and dispose of polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated oil 
in determining our aros  we make assumptions regarding probable future disposal costs 
a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the aros reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  we have recorded aros of million and million  respectively 
for additional information on our legal aros  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
non legal liability cost of removal we collect in our prices the costs to dispose of plant assets that do not represent legal retirement obligations 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in amounts collected  but not yet spent  for removal costs classified as a regulatory liability 

table of contents contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and have estimated the probable cost for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates are based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible that our future consolidated financial results could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
see note and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies and legal proceedings  for more detailed information 
operating results we evaluate operating results based on eps 
we have various classifications of revenues  defined as follows retail sales of electricity to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
classification of customers as residential  commercial or industrial requires judgment and our classifications may be different from other companies 
assignment of tariffs is not dependent on classification 
other retail sales of electricity for lighting public streets and highways  net of revenue subject to refund 
wholesale sales of electricity to electric cooperatives  municipalities and other electric utilities  the prices for which are either based on cost or prevailing market prices as prescribed by ferc authority 
this category also includes changes in valuations of contracts for the sale of such electricity that have yet to settle 
margins realized from sales based on prevailing market prices generally serve to offset our retail prices and the prices charged to certain wholesale customers taking service under cost based tariffs 
transmission reflects transmission revenues  including those based on tariffs with the spp 
other miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others 
this category also includes energy marketing transactions unrelated to the production of our generating assets  changes in valuations of related contracts and fees we earn for marketing services that we provide for third parties 
electric utility revenues are impacted by things such as rate regulation  fuel costs  customer conservation efforts  the economy and competitive forces 
changing weather also affects the amount of electricity our customers use as electricity sales are seasonal 
as a summer peaking utility  the third quarter typically accounts for our greatest electricity sales 
hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand  especially among residential customers 
mild weather reduces customer demand 
our wholesale revenues are impacted by  among other factors  demand  cost and availability of fuel and purchased power  price volatility  available generation capacity  transmission availability and weather 

table of contents compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december   compared to the results for the year ended december  significant changes in results of operations shown in the table immediately below are further explained in the descriptions that follow 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands  except per share amounts revenues residential commercial industrial other retail total retail revenues wholesale transmission a other total revenues operating expenses fuel and purchased power operating and maintenance depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense investment earnings other income other expense total other expense interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to westar energy preferred dividends net income attributable to common stock basic earnings per average common share outstanding attributable to westar energy a transmission reflects revenue from an spp network transmission tariff 
in and  our spp network transmission costs were million and million  respectively 
these amounts  less administration costs of million and million  respectively  were returned to us as revenue 

table of contents gross margin fuel and purchased power costs fluctuate with electricity sales and unit costs 
as permitted by regulators  we adjust our retail prices to reflect changes in the costs of fuel and purchased power 
fuel and purchased power costs for wholesale customers are recovered at prevailing market prices or based on a predetermined formula with a price adjustment approved by ferc 
as a result  changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in revenues with minimal impact on net income 
for this reason  we believe gross margin is useful for understanding and analyzing changes in our operating performance from one period to the next 
we calculate gross margin as total revenues less the sum of fuel and purchased power costs and spp network transmission costs 
transmission costs reflect the costs of providing network transmission service 
accordingly  in calculating gross margin  we recognize the net value of this transmission activity as shown in the table immediately following 
however  we record transmission costs as operating and maintenance expense on our consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes our gross margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  change change dollars in thousands revenues residential commercial industrial other retail total retail revenues wholesale transmission other total revenues less fuel and purchased power expense spp network transmission costs gross margin the following table reflects changes in electricity sales for the years ended december  and no electricity sales are shown for transmission or other as they are not directly related to the amount of electricity we sell 
year ended december  change change thousands of mwh electricity sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail wholesale total gross margin increased due primarily to higher total retail revenues  of which was due to higher prices and of which was due to higher electricity sales 
the increase in retail electricity sales was due principally to higher industrial electricity sales 
we believe improving economic conditions are why some of our industrial customers experienced increased production  which resulted in more electricity sales to them 
residential and commercial electricity sales increased due primarily to the effects of warmer weather 
as measured by cooling degree days  the weather in was warmer than in 
table of contents income from operations is the most directly comparable measure to gross margin that is calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in our consolidated statements of income 
our presentation of gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations 
additionally  our presentation of gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table reconciles income from operations with gross margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross margin add spp network transmission costs less operating and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization expense selling  general and administrative expense income from operations operating expenses and other income and expense items year ended december  change change dollars in thousands operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expense increased due principally to higher spp network transmission costs of million  most of which is recovered in revenues  higher costs at wolf creek of million  which was the result primarily of an increase in the amortization of deferred refueling and maintenance outage costs of million and higher regulatory compliance costs  a million increase in property taxes  which was mostly offset in retail revenues  our having recorded in a million reduction in our liability for environmental remediation costs associated with assets we divested many years ago  a million increase related to the operation of our steam powered plants  and higher costs for tree trimming and other distribution reliability activities of million  however  partially offsetting these increases was an million decrease in the amortization of previously deferred storm costs 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of our having recorded additional depreciation expense associated primarily with the addition of transmission facilities and additions at our power plants  including air quality controls 

table of contents year ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense decreased due primarily to the reversal of approximately million of previously accrued liabilities as a result of the legal settlements discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings  and our having recorded million less for non union  non executive employee compensation that is at risk to employees and payable only upon meeting pre established operating and financial objectives 
partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases was a million increase in the amortization of previously deferred amounts associated with various energy efficiency programs  which we recover in higher retail revenues  and higher legal fees of million related principally to the legal matters discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands investment earnings investment earnings increased due principally to our having recorded a million gain on the sale of a non utility investment 
this increase was offset partially by our having recorded lower gains on investments held in a trust to fund retirement benefits 
we recorded gains on these investments of million in compared to gains of million recorded in year ended december  change change dollars in thousands other income other income increased due principally to a million increase in equity afudc  which reflects increased construction activity  and our having recorded gains on the sale of no 
oil of million  for which similar gains were not recorded in year ended december  change change dollars in thousands income tax expense income tax expense increased due principally to higher income from continuing operations before income taxes 

table of contents compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december   compared to the results for the year ended december  significant changes in results of operations shown in the table immediately below are further explained in the descriptions that follow

year ended december  change change thousands of mwh electricity sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail wholesale total gross margin increased due principally to an increase in total retail revenues 
of the million increase in total retail revenues  was attributable to higher electricity sales and was due to higher prices as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  rate matters and regulation 
retail electricity sales increased due primarily to the effects of warmer weather  which particularly impacted residential electricity sales  and for reasons we believe to be principally related to improved economic conditions 
as measured by cooling degree days  the weather during was warmer than and warmer than the year average 
while weather also affects commercial and industrial customers  those electricity sales typically are not as sensitive to weather as residential electricity sales 
we believe improving economic conditions are why some of our commercial and industrial customers experienced increased orders and production in  which lead to increased electricity sales to them 
economic conditions generally have not recovered to levels experienced prior to the economic downturn 

table of contents the following table reconciles income from operations with gross margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross margin add spp network transmission costs less operating and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization expense selling  general and administrative expense income from operations operating expenses and other income and expense items year ended december  change change dollars in thousands operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expense increased due primarily to higher spp network transmission costs of million  which were offset by higher spp network transmission revenues of million  higher power plant maintenance costs of million and higher maintenance costs of million for our electrical distribution system 
the higher power plant maintenance costs were due primarily to higher costs at wolf creek and our wind generation facilities while the increase in maintenance costs for our electrical distribution system was due principally to additional tree trimming and other line clearance activities in offsetting these increases was a million reduction resulting from the consolidation of vies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities  and a million reduction in our liability for environmental remediation costs associated with assets we divested many years ago 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily to reflect the addition of wind generation facilities  new generating plant  air quality controls at our power plants and other plant additions 
we also recorded additional depreciation expense of million as a result of consolidating vies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expense a significant amount of our non union  non executive employee compensation is at risk to employees and  therefore  payable only in the event we meet pre established operating and financial objectives 
likewise  under our executive long term incentive and share award plan  shares are issued only when certain service conditions are met and or we meet pre established financial objectives 
in we adjusted these compensation plans to better align compensation with our financial performance 
selling  general and administrative expense increased due principally to higher compensation expense of million that was primarily the result of the aforementioned plan adjustments and our improved financial performance 
this increase was partially offset by our having recorded a million expense in related to the settlement of the epa lawsuit discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 

table of contents year ended december  change change dollars in thousands investment earnings investment earnings decreased due principally to our having recorded lower gains on investments held in a trust to fund retirement benefits 
we recorded gains on these investments of million in compared to gains of million recorded in year ended december  change change dollars in thousands interest expense interest expense increased due primarily to our having recorded additional interest expense of million as a result of consolidating vies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities  and interest on additional debt issued in june to fund capital investments 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands income tax expense income tax expense increased due principally to higher income from continuing operations before income taxes 
financial condition a number of factors affected amounts recorded on our balance sheet as of december   compared to december  year ended december  change change dollars in thousands fuel inventory and supplies fuel inventory and supplies increased due principally to a million increase in storeroom inventory largely resulting from additional materials and replacement parts for new air quality controls 
coal inventory increased million due to a increase in the delivered cost of coal resulting primarily from a new long term transportation contract at la cygne 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands property  plant and equipment  net property  plant and equipment  net increased due to additions of million at our power plants  including the installation of air quality controls  distribution and transmission projects 

table of contents year ended december  change change dollars in thousands regulatory assets regulatory liabilities net regulatory assets total regulatory assets increased due primarily to the following reasons a million increase in deferred employee benefits  a million decrease in the fair value of treasury yield hedges  a million increase in net amounts deferred for the wolf creek outage  and a million increase in deferred fuel costs  however  partially offsetting increases was a million decrease in previously deferred storm costs 
regulatory liabilities increased due principally to a million increase in removal costs and an million increase in our refund obligation related to the reca 
offsetting increases was the million revision in our estimated costs to decommission wolf creek 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands short term debt short term debt increased due principally to increased borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facility 
we used borrowings under the revolving credit facility to fund our capital and on going operating needs on an interim basis 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands other current liabilities other current liabilities decreased due principally to the following reasons our having reached settlement agreements with former officers as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings  and our having accrued million less in for non union  non executive  at risk employee compensation than in  however  partially offsetting decreases was the change in the fair value of treasury yield hedges 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands net deferred income tax liabilities net deferred income taxes increased due primarily to recording million of tax benefits resulting from the use of bonus and accelerated depreciation methods 
however  the following partially offset this increase the tax effect of a deferred net operating loss for the current year of million  and a net state tax credit carryforward benefit of million including the reversal of a valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance relates to the state tax credit carryforwards that are now more likely than not to be realized due to a state law change which extends the state tax credit carryforward period from to years 

table of contents year ended december  change change dollars in thousands unamortized investment tax credits unamortized investment tax credits increased due primarily to reversing million of valuation allowances on state investment tax credits as discussed in the prior paragraph 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands accrued employee benefits accrued employee benefits increased due primarily to a higher projected benefit obligation for our and wolf creek s pension plans 
we recognize as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability the difference between the fair value of pension and post retirement benefit plan assets and the liabilities for pension and post retirement benefit plans 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans and wolf creek employee benefit plans  respectively  for additional information 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands other long term liabilities other long term liabilities increased due primarily to a power supply agreement classified as a capital lease during the year offset by legal settlements with former executive officers

liquidity and capital resources overview available sources of funds to operate our business include internally generated cash  westar energy s revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program  and access to capital markets 
we expect to meet our day to day cash requirements including  among other items  fuel and purchased power  dividends  interest payments  income taxes and pension contributions  using primarily internally generated cash  borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and commercial paper issuances 
to meet the cash requirements for our capital investments  we expect to use internally generated cash  temporary borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and commercial paper issuances  as well as the issuance of debt and equity securities in the capital markets 
we also use proceeds from the issuance of securities to repay short term borrowings  which are principally related to investments in capital equipment  when such balances are of sufficient size and it makes economic sense to do so  and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the aforementioned sources and uses of cash are similar to our historical activities 
for additional information on our future cash requirements  see future cash requirements below 

table of contents during  we plan to increase our capital spending and expect to continue contributing to our pension trust 
we continue to believe that we will have the ability to pay dividends 
uncertainties affecting our ability to meet cash requirements include  among others factors affecting revenues described in operating results above  economic conditions  regulatory actions  compliance with environmental regulations and conditions in the capital markets 
capital structure as of december  and  our capital structure  excluding short term debt  was as follows common equity preferred stock noncontrolling interests long term debt  including vies short term borrowings on december   westar energy entered into a commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of billion 
this program is supported by westar energy s revolving credit facilities described below 
maturities of commercial paper issuances may not exceed days from the date of issuance and proceeds from such issuances will be used to repay borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facilities  for capital expenditures and or for other general corporate purposes 
as of february   westar energy had issued million of commercial paper 
westar energy has two revolving credit facilities in the amounts of million and million  which terminate on september   and february   respectively 
as long as there is no default under the facilities  each may be extended up to an additional two years and the aggregate amount of borrowings under the facilities may be increased to billion and million  respectively  subject to lender participation 
all borrowings under the facilities are secured by kge first mortgage bonds 
as of february   no amounts were borrowed and million of letters of credit had been issued under the million facility 
no amounts were borrowed and no letters of credit were issued under the million facility as of the same date 
in addition  total combined borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and the commercial paper program may not exceed billion at any given time 
a default by westar energy or kge under other indebtedness totaling more than million would be a default under both revolving credit facilities 
westar energy is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio of or less at all times 
at december   our ratio was 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  short term debt  for additional information regarding our short term borrowings 
debt financing the westar energy and kge mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that can be issued by each entity 
we must comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness 
under the westar energy mortgage  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
in addition  so long as any bonds issued prior to january   remain outstanding  the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless westar energy s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest  depreciation and property retirement which as defined  does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries  for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance  are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on or of the principal amount of all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
as of december   approximately billion principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage  except in connection with certain refundings 

table of contents under the kge mortgage  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
in addition  the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless kge s net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one half times the annual interest charges on or of the principal amount of all kge first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
as of december   based on an assumed interest rate of  approximately million principal amount of additional kge first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage 
some of our debt instruments contain restrictions that require us to maintain leverage ratios as defined in the credit agreements 
we calculate these ratios in accordance with the agreements 
we use these ratios solely to determine compliance with our various debt covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  as of december   we had million of variable rate  tax exempt bonds 
interest rates payable under these bonds had historically been set by auctions  which occur every days 
however  auctions for these bonds have failed over the past few years  resulting in volatile alternative index based interest rates for these bonds 
while the interest rates for these bonds have been extremely low  we continuously monitor the credit markets and evaluate our options with respect to our auction rate bonds 
impact of credit ratings on debt financing moody s investors service moody s  standard poor s ratings services s p and fitch ratings fitch are independent credit rating agencies that rate our debt securities 
these ratings indicate each agency s assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our securities 
in general  more favorable credit ratings increase borrowing opportunities and reduce the cost of borrowing 
under westar energy s revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program  our cost of borrowings is determined in part by credit ratings 
however  westar energy s ability to borrow under the credit facilities and commercial paper program are not conditioned on maintaining a particular credit rating 
we may enter into new credit agreements that contain credit rating conditions  which could affect our liquidity and or our borrowing costs 
factors that impact our credit ratings include a combination of objective and subjective criteria 
objective criteria include typical financial ratios  such as total debt to total capitalization and funds from operations to total debt  among others  future capital expenditures and our access to liquidity including committed lines of credit 
subjective criteria include such items as the quality and credibility of management  the political and regulatory environment we operate in and an assessment of our governance and risk management practices 
on may   fitch upgraded its credit ratings for westar energy and kge first mortgage bonds senior secured debt to a from bbb 
fitch also upgraded its credit rating for westar energy unsecured debt to bbb from bbb and changed its outlook for the ratings from positive to stable 
on december   fitch assigned its f rating to westar energy s commercial paper program and also affirmed its other ratings provided in the table below with a stable outlook

table of contents certain of our derivative instruments contain collateral provisions subject to credit agency ratings of our senior unsecured debt 
if our senior unsecured debt ratings were to decrease or fall below investment grade  the counterparties to the derivative instruments  pursuant to the provisions  could require collateralization on derivative instruments 
the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with objective credit risk related contingent features that were in a liability position as of december  and  was million and million  respectively  for which we had posted no collateral as of either date 
if all credit risk related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered as of december  and  we would have been required to provide to our counterparties million and million  respectively  of additional collateral after taking into consideration the offsetting impact of derivative assets and net accounts receivable

table of contents summary of cash flows year ended december  in thousands cash flows from used in operating activities investing activities financing activities investing activities of discontinued operations net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities operating activities provided million of cash in compared with cash provided from operating activities of million during the decrease was due primarily to our having paid million more for purchases of coal and natural gas for our power plants  million more for the planned wolf creek refueling and maintenance outage  million more for pension and post retirement benefit plan contributions  our having received million less in income tax refunds in and our having paid more for maintenance on our power plants and distribution system 
in  we also paid former executive officers approximately million in compensation and paid approximately million for their legal fees and expenses as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings 
partially offsetting these decreases was our having received approximately million more in customer receipts 
operating activities provided million of cash in compared with cash provided from operating activities of million during this increase was due primarily to our having received million more in customer receipts and our having received million more in net tax refunds 
with the consolidation of the vies discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities  a portion of lease payments reported as operating cash flows in was reported as financing cash flows in  which resulted in about a million increase in operating cash flows in in addition  we contributed million less to the westar energy pension trust  westar energy post retirement benefit plan and wolf creek pension trust  and during  we paid million more for our share of wolf creek s refueling outage 
partially offsetting these increases was our having paid in million more for fuel and purchased power and million more for interest on corporate owned life insurance coli policies  which was the result of a policy change in the second quarter of under which we no longer pay interest on such policies in advance 
cash flows used in investing activities our principal use of cash for investing purposes relates to growing and improving our utility plant 
the utility business is capital intensive and requires significant ongoing investment in plant 
we invested million in  million in and million in in additions to property  plant and equipment 
the increase from to was due principally to additions at our power plants  including air quality controls  and the addition of transmission facilities  which required significant amounts of cash 
cash flows from used in financing activities financing activities provided million of cash in compared to using million of cash in the increase was due principally to our having received million more in proceeds from the issuance of common stock as a result primarily of the settlement of forward sale transactions during also contributing to the increase was our having borrowed million under a revolving credit facility in compared to our having repaid million of borrowings under the facility in we used borrowings under the revolving credit facility to fund our capital and on going operating needs while the proceeds from the issuance of common stock were used to repay such borrowings as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes 
partially offsetting the aforementioned increases was our having paid million more in dividends during  which was attributable to our having increased our common stock dividend from per share in to per share in as well as an increase in common shares outstanding in due principally to the settlement of forward sale transactions as discussed above

future cash requirements our business requires significant capital investments 
through  we expect to need cash primarily for utility construction programs designed to improve and expand facilities related to providing electric service  which include  but are not limited to  expenditures for environmental projects at our coal fired power plants  new transmission lines and other improvements to our power plants  transmission and distribution lines  and equipment 
we expect to meet these cash needs with internally generated cash  borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facilities  commercial paper and the issuance of securities in the capital markets 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations  which are subject to changing interpretations and amendments 
changes to environmental regulations could result in significantly more stringent laws and regulations or interpretations thereof that could affect our company and industry in particular 
these laws  regulations and interpretations could result in more stringent terms in our existing operating permits or a failure to obtain new permits could cause a material increase in our capital or operational costs and could otherwise have a material effect on our operations and consolidated financial results

table of contents other information changes in prices kcc proceedings we plan to file an application with the kcc in late february to adjust our prices to include updated transmission costs as reflected in our transmission formula rate effective january   discussed below 
if approved  we estimate that the new prices will increase our annual retail revenues by approximately million 
we expect the kcc to issue an order on our request in april on december   the kcc issued a final order approving a price adjustment we made earlier in to increase retail revenues to reflect adjustments to our transmission formula rate effective january   as discussed below 
the new prices were effective april   and are expected to increase our annual retail revenues by approximately million 
on october   the kcc issued an order allowing us to adjust our prices to include previously deferred amounts associated with various energy efficiency programs 
the new prices were effective in november and are expected to increase our annual retail revenues by approximately million 
on august   we filed an application with the kcc proposing a million increase in our annual retail prices 
the primary drivers for the proposed increase were higher costs related to tree trimming  regulatory compliance  operating wolf creek and employee benefits 
on february   we entered into a definitive stipulation and agreement agreed to or not opposed by all parties to this proceeding  with the exception of a consumer advocate 
the settlement provides for a million increase in our annual retail prices and is subject to kcc approval 
technical hearings commenced on february  we expect the kcc to issue an order on our request in april on february   kcpl filed an application requesting that the kcc predetermine the ratemaking principles for and determine the appropriateness of approximately billion of environmental upgrades proposed for la cygne to comply with environmental regulations 
we have a interest in la cygne and intervened in the proceeding 
on august   the kcc issued an order ruling that the decision to make the upgrades is prudent and the billion project cost estimate is reasonable 
the kcc denied our request to collect our approximately million share of the costs of the environmental upgrades through our ecrr 
however  in the stipulation and agreement noted above  all parties to the agreement agreed that we may file an abbreviated rate review to update our prices to include capital costs associated with the project  which we plan to do

the updated rate was effective january   and is expected to increase our annual transmission revenues by approximately million 
our transmission formula rate that includes projected transmission capital expenditures and operating costs was effective january   and was expected to increase our annual transmission revenues by approximately million 
the transmission formula rate provides the basis for our annual request with the kcc to adjust our retail prices to include updated transmission costs necessary to serve our retail customers 
wolf creek outage on january   a breaker in a substation located at wolf creek failed 
this failure was immediately followed by a loss of station power to wolf creek resulting in an unscheduled shutdown of wolf creek 
we currently expect wolf creek to resume normal operations in late february to mid march following the completion of repairs 
this schedule assumes no discovery during the course of repairs of additional significant required work  and that all requirements of the nrc for resumption of normal operations are satisfied 
additional maintenance expenses and capital expenditures will be incurred as a result of this unscheduled outage 

table of contents new financial regulation in july  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act was signed into law 
although the dodd frank act is focused primarily on the regulation and oversight of financial institutions  it also calls for new regulation of the derivatives markets  including mandatory clearing of certain swaps  exchange trading  margin requirements and other transparency requirements  which could impact our operations and consolidated financial results 
as many of the implementing regulations for the dodd frank act have not yet been finalized  we cannot predict what the impact might be 
we will continue to evaluate the dodd frank act as more implementing regulations are finalized 
stock based compensation we use two types of restricted share units rsus for our stock based compensation awards  those with service requirements and those with performance measures

total unrecognized compensation cost related to rsu awards with only service requirements was million as of december   and we expect to recognize these costs over a remaining weighted average period of years 
total unrecognized compensation cost related to rsu awards with performance measures was million as of december   and we expect to recognize these costs over a remaining weighted average period of years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our fuel procurement and energy marketing activities involve primary market risk exposures  including commodity price risk  credit risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sale of electricity and energy related products 
credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial impact related to changes in interest rates 
in addition  our investments in trusts to fund nuclear plant decommissioning and to fund non qualified retirement benefits give rise to security price risk 
many of the securities in these trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in the capital markets 
commodity price risk we engage in both financial and physical trading with the goal of managing our commodity price risk  enhancing system reliability and increasing profits 
we procure and trade electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products by utilizing energy commodity contracts and a variety of financial instruments  including futures contracts  options and swaps 
within our energy trading portfolio  we may establish certain positions intended to economically hedge a portion of physical sale or purchase contracts and we may enter into certain positions attempting to take advantage of market trends and conditions 
we use the term economic hedge to mean a strategy intended to manage risks of volatility in prices or rate movements on selected assets  liabilities or anticipated transactions by creating a relationship in which gains or losses on derivative instruments are expected to offset the losses or gains on the assets  liabilities or anticipated transactions exposed to such market risks 
at the time we enter into these transactions  we are unable to determine the hedge value until the agreements are actually settled 
our future exposure to changes in prices will be dependent on the market prices and the extent and effectiveness of any economic hedging arrangements into which we enter 
additionally  net open positions exist  or are established  due to the origination of new transactions and our assessment of  and response to  changing market conditions 
to the extent we have net open positions  we are exposed to the risk that changing market prices could have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
we use various types of fuel  including coal  natural gas  uranium  diesel and oil  to operate our plants and also purchase power to meet customer demand 
our prices and consolidated financial results are exposed to market risks from commodity price changes for electricity and other energy related products as well as interest rates 
volatility in these markets impacts our costs of purchased power  costs of fuel for our generating plants and our participation in energy markets 
we strive to manage our customers and our exposure to these market risks through regulatory  operating and financing activities and  when we deem appropriate  we economically hedge a portion of these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments for non trading purposes 

table of contents factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation  the availability of our power plants and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
quantities of fossil fuel we use to generate electricity fluctuate from period to period based on availability  price and deliverability of a given fuel type  as well as planned and unscheduled outages at our generating plants that use fossil fuels 
our commodity price exposure is also affected by our nuclear plant refueling and maintenance schedule 
our customers electricity usage also varies based on weather  the economy and other factors 
we trade various types of fuel primarily to reduce exposure related to the volatility of commodity prices 
a significant portion of our coal requirements is purchased under long term contracts to hedge much of the fuel exposure for customers 
if we were unable to generate an adequate supply of electricity for our customers  we would purchase power in the wholesale market to the extent it is available  subject to possible transmission constraints  and or implement curtailment or interruption procedures as permitted in our tariffs and terms and conditions of service 
one way by which we manage and measure the commodity price risk of our trading portfolio is by using a variance covariance value at risk var model 
in addition to var  we employ additional risk control processes such as stress testing  daily loss limits  credit limits and position limits 
we expect to use similar control processes in the future 
the use of var requires assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level and a measure of volatility associated with potential losses and the estimated holding period 
we express var as a potential dollar loss based on a confidence level using a one day holding period and a day historical observation period 
it is possible that actual results may differ significantly from assumptions 
accordingly  var may not accurately reflect our levels of exposure 
the energy trading and market based wholesale portfolio var amounts for and were as follows in thousands high low average we have considered a variety of risks and costs associated with the future contractual commitments included in our trading portfolios 
these risks include valuation and marking of illiquid pricing locations and products  the financial condition of our counterparties and interest rate movement 
see the credit risk and interest rate risk discussions below for additional information 
also  there can be no assurance that the employment of var  credit practices or other risk management tools we employ will eliminate possible losses 
credit risk we are exposed to counterparty default risk with our retail  wholesale and energy marketing activities  including participation in rtos 
such credit risk is associated with the financial condition of counterparties  product location basis pricing differentials  physical liquidity constraints and other risks 
declines in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could have a material impact on our overall exposure to credit risk 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties intended to reduce our overall credit risk 
we also employ additional credit risk control mechanisms that we believe are appropriate  such as requiring counterparties to issue letters of credit or parental guarantees in our favor and entering into master netting agreements with counterparties that allow for offsetting exposures 
certain of our derivative instruments contain collateral provisions subject to credit agency ratings of our senior unsecured debt 
if our senior unsecured debt ratings were to decrease or fall below investment grade  the counterparties to the derivative instruments  pursuant to the provisions  could require collateralization on derivative instruments 
the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with objective credit risk related contingent features that were in a liability position as of december  and  was million and million  respectively  for which we had posted no collateral as of either date 
if all credit risk related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered as of december  and  we would have been required to provide to our counterparties million and million  respectively  of additional collateral after taking into consideration the offsetting impact of derivative assets and net accounts receivable 

table of contents interest rate risk we have entered into numerous fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
for details  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
we manage our interest rate risk related to these debt obligations by limiting our variable interest rate exposure  utilizing various maturity dates and entering into treasury yield hedge transactions 
we may also use other financial derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps 
we compute and present information about the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a basis point change in the current interest rates applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 
we had approximately million of variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of december  a basis point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately million 
as of december   we had million of variable rate bonds insured by bond insurers 
interest rates payable under these bonds are normally set through periodic auctions 
however  conditions in the credit markets over the past few years caused a dramatic reduction in the demand for auction bonds  which lead to failed auctions 
the contractual provisions of these securities set forth an indexing formula method by which interest will be paid in the event of an auction failure 
depending on the level of these reference indices  our interest costs may be higher or lower than what they would have been had the securities been auctioned successfully 
additionally  should insurers of those bonds experience a decrease in their credit ratings  such event would most likely increase our borrowing costs 
furthermore  a decline in interest rates generally can serve to increase our pension and post retirement benefit obligations and negatively affect investment returns 
as of december   we had recorded million in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect the fair value of treasury yield hedge transactions with a total notional amount of million 
these transactions were measured at fair value by estimating the net present value of a series of payments using models with inputs such as the spread between the year us treasury bill yield and the contracted  fixed yield 
on january   we settled the treasury yield hedge transactions for a total cost of million 
the cost of the hedge transactions will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt 
security price risk we maintain the ndt  as required by the nrc and kansas statue  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   investments in the ndt were allocated to equity securities  to debt securities  to combination debt equity securities  to real estate securities and less than to cash equivalents 
the fair value of the ndt investments was million as of december   and million as of december  changes in interest rates and or other market changes resulting in a decrease in the value of the securities would have resulted in a million decrease in the value of the ndt as of december  we also maintain a trust to fund non qualified retirement benefits 
as of december   investments in the trust were comprised of equity securities  debt securities and less than cash equivalents 
the fair value of the investments in this trust was million as of december   and million as of december  changes in interest rates and or other market changes resulting in a decrease in the value of the securities would have resulted in a million decrease in the value of the trust as of december  by maintaining diversified portfolios of securities  we seek to maximize the returns to fund the aforementioned obligations within acceptable risk tolerances  including interest rate risk 
however  many of the securities in the portfolios are exposed to price fluctuations in the capital markets 
if the value of the securities diminishes  the cost of funding the obligations rises 
we actively monitor the portfolios by benchmarking the performance of the investments against relevant indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing the asset allocations in relation to established policy targets 
our exposure to security price risk related to the ndt is in part mitigated because we are currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in the prices we charge our customers
