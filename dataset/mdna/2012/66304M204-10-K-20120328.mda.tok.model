capital adequacy 
the board of governors and the fdic have adopted risk based capital guidelines for evaluating the capital adequacy of bank holding companies and banks 
the guidelines are designed to make capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations  to take into account off balance sheet exposures and to aid in making the definition of bank capital uniform internationally 
under the guidelines  the company and its banking subsidiaries are required to maintain capital equal to at least of its assets and commitments to extend credit  weighted by risk  of which at least must consist primarily of common equity including retained earnings and the remainder may consist of subordinated debt  cumulative preferred stock  or a limited amount of loan loss reserves 
the company and nvb are subject to regulations issued by the board of governors and the fdic  which require maintenance of a certain level of capital 
these regulations impose two capital standards a risk based capital standard and a leverage capital standard 
assets  commitments to extend credit and off balance sheet items are categorized according to risk and certain assets considered to present less risk than others permit maintenance of capital at less than the ratio 
for example  most home mortgage loans are placed in a risk category and therefore require maintenance of capital equal to of such loans  while commercial loans are placed in a risk category and therefore require maintenance of capital equal to of such loans 
under the board of governors risk based capital guidelines  assets reported on an institution s balance sheet and certain off balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories  each of which has an assigned risk weight 
capital ratios are calculated by dividing the institution s qualifying capital by its period end risk weighted assets 
the guidelines establish two categories of qualifying capital tier capital defined to include common stockholders equity and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and tier capital which includes  among other items  limited life and in case of banks  cumulative preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt and a limited amount of reserve for loan losses 
tier capital may also include up to of the pretax net unrealized gains on certain available for sale equity securities having readily determinable fair values ie the excess  if any  of fair market value over the book value or historical cost of the investment security 
the federal regulatory agencies reserve the right to exclude all or a portion of the unrealized gains upon a determination that the equity securities are not prudently valued 
unrealized gains and losses on other types of assets  such as bank premises and available for sale debt securities  are not included in tier capital  but may be taken into account in the evaluation of overall capital adequacy and net unrealized losses on available for sale equity securities will continue to be deducted from tier capital as a cushion against risk 
each institution is required to maintain a risk based capital ratio including tier and tier capital of  of which at least half must be tier capital 
under the board of governors leverage capital standard  an institution is required to maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to the sum of its quarterly average total assets and quarterly average reserve for loan losses  less intangibles not included in tier capital 
period end assets may be used in place of quarterly average total assets on a case by case basis 
the board of governors and the fdic have adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies as a supplement to the risk weighted capital guidelines 
the leverage ratio establishes a minimum tier ratio of tier capital to total assets for the highest rated bank holding companies or those that have implemented the risk based capital market risk measure 
all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum tier leverage ratio of with higher leverage capital ratios required for bank holding companies that have significant financial and or operational weakness  a high risk profile  or are undergoing or anticipating rapid growth 
at december   the company and the bank were in compliance with the risk based capital and leverage ratios described above
