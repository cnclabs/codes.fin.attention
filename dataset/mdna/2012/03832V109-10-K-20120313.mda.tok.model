general we are a nevada corporation and have been in existence since on september   the company changed its name from nexmed  inc to apricus biosciences  inc we have operated in the pharmaceutical industry since  initially focusing primarily on research and development in the area of drug delivery and now additionally we are focusing on the specialty pharmaceutical business primarily in oncology and oncology supportive care 
our proprietary drug delivery technology is called nexact and we have one approved drug using the nexact delivery system  vitaros  which is approved in canada for the treatment of erectile dysfunction  which we expect will be launched this year by our partner abbott 
we have recently added additional approved products including totect  granisol and aquoral as described below being marketed in the area of oncology support and nitromist in the cardiovascular area  and we expect to relaunch our products in the us in the middle of this year 
our pipeline of nexact product candidates includes femprox for female sexual arousal disorder  mycova for onychomycosis excluding tinea pedis nail fungal infection  rayva for raynaud s syndrome  and prevonco for liver cancer 
we are seeking to enhance our business development activities by offering potential partners clearly defined regulatory paths for our product candidates under development 
we are seeking to expand the potential uses of the nexact technology into the topical  transdermal  oral  subcutaneous  ocular and rectal delivery of multi classes of drugs for these and other indications 
in addition  we are actively engaged in acquiring companies and in licensing drugs that will complement our product portfolio 
we purchased topotarget usa  inc  a company that owns the rights to totect  the only drug approved in the us for the treatment of anthracycline extravasation  and we have in licensed the rights to co promote the drug granisol  the only fda approved  oral  ready to use liquid solution of granisetron  and aquoral  an fda cleared  prescription only spray for the treatment of xerostomia the medical term for dry mouth due to a lack of saliva in the us 
we also acquired the rights to granisol outside the us and recently added the ex north american rights for nitromist  an fda approved nitrate vasodilator indicated for acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris chest pain due to coronary artery disease narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart 
we continue to enter into and are seeking additional commercialization partnerships for our existing pipeline of products and product candidates  including vitaros  mycova  femprox and prevonco and we are enhancing our business development efforts by offering potential partners clearly defined regulatory paths for our products under development 
our lead product  vitaros  was approved for commercialization in canada in november  and is now partnered in the united states  canada  germany  certain countries in the middle east  the gulf countries  israel and italy 
most recently  the company entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with abbott laboratories limited abbott to market vitaros in canada  who plan to launch the product in canada in and we expect to begin to receive royalties in  and sandoz  a division of novartis  for germany 
our near term focus for vitaros is to commence sales in canada this year through our commercial partner abbott and to continue to generate revenue from partnerships for the product with other commercial partners 
we also expect payment from our partners on the approval of vitaros in europe and other territories 
typically  in our partnership arrangements we receive up front payments in exchange for license rights to our products plus sales milestones and royalties to be paid upon commercialization of the product 
for vitaros we filed for commercialization approval in europe in the second quarter of we believe that if vitaros is approved in europe in the first half of  we may start to receive royalty revenues beginning in late for the major markets described above where we have license agreements in place 
this strategy of licensing products and product candidates is expected to continue in future years for femprox  mycova  rayva and prevonco which are our other late stage products 
the company launched its commercialization arm beginning in oncology supportive care in december with the acquisition of topotarget usa  inc  since renamed apricus pharmaceuticals usa  inc 
apricus pharmaceuticals  gaining a pre existing sales infrastructure  small sales team  and a revenue generating product with what the company believes to be a strong future growth potential and an additional second use label opportunity 
the oncology supportive care product platform was expanded through an agreement with pediatrx  inc in january  with co promotion rights to two additional products in this space  granisol and aquoral 
we expect to re launch each of these products in the united states markets in mid and have commercial rights to each of these products in additional territories including canada and latin america and worldwide for granisol 
in the near term  we will be using the established apricus pharmaceuticals supply chain infrastructure for delivery of these products and with the acquisition of topotarget usa  we have a small oncology sales force in place that is able to market and sell multiple products to the same end user which in our case is the oncology supportive care nurse and hospital pharmacist who stock the product 
we are forecasting to record product sales with positive gross margin contributions for each of these three products in  though there can be no assurances 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition 
we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each year since our inception 
through december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and our operations have principally been financed through public offering of our common stock and other equity instruments  private placements of equity securities  debt financing and up front license fees received from commercial partners 
funds raised in recent periods  include approximately million in net proceeds from our february follow on public offering  approximately million during from the sale of common stock and approximately million from the exercise of warrants outstanding see note to the consolidated financial statements should not be considered an indication of our ability to raise additional funds in any future periods 
our cash reserves are approximately million as of the date of filing this report on form k 
we expect our cash inflows during will be from licensing and milestone revenues received from commercial partners for our late stage nexact product candidates and from product revenues from the sale of our oncology supportive care products sold in the united states 
we expect our most significant expenditures in will include development expenditures including filing for market authorization for multiple drugs in multiple territories  product re launches and for the overall expansion of the commercial operations of the company 
we have the objective of becoming cash flow positive during primarily from the expected growth in revenues from out licensing agreements and from the profitable sales of oncology support products that we market now and from additional products to be added in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that we succeed in accomplishing this objective in  if at all 
even if we are successful in obtaining additional partners who will support further development of our products  we may still encounter additional obstacles such as our development activities may not be successful  our products may not prove to be safe and effective  clinical development work may not be completed in a timely manner or at all  and the anticipated products may not be commercially viable or successfully marketed 
should we not be able to find development partners in and not achieve our product sales expectation  we would require additional external financing to fund our operations and we may not achieve our goals of being cash flow positive during additionally  our business could require additional financing if we choose to accelerate product development expenditures in advance of receiving up front payments from development and commercial partners 
the timing of receipts of up front and milestone payments are difficult to estimate and we would seek to obtain additional outside equity capital as necessary to support the commercial opportunities for our product portfolio 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  compared to million at december  during  we received net proceeds of approximately million as a result of the sale of our common stock and pursuant to a sales agreement as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also received net proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of warrants and million at june  from the sale of the bio quant subsidiary 
the receipt of this cash during was offset by our cash used in operations 
our net cash outflow from operations during the year was approximately million which resulted from the increase in expenditures for research and development activities while we commercialize our vitaros product for sale in the canadian market and obtain market approval in other regions 
during the first half of  we operated our bio quant cro  which contributed revenue for us  yet did not generate cash in the first half of the ongoing revenues and costs related to bio quant were eliminated with the sale of the operation on june  and the transaction was structured with an earn out that allows for cash to be received by us over the next years based on the success of the buyer  biotox sciences biotox 
our operational structure with a minimum number of employees and limited space need allows us to closely regulate our level of expenditures and to quickly adjust our spending rates as commercial opportunities develop 
we operate in a rapidly changing and highly regulated marketplace and we expect to adjust our capital needs and financing plans as market conditions dictate 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a brief description of the more significant accounting policies and related estimate methods that we follow income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates of our current tax exposure and temporary differences resulting from timing differences for reporting items for book and tax purposes 
we recognize deferred taxes by the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
critical estimate in consideration of our accumulated losses and lack of historical ability to generate taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets  we have estimated that we will not be able to realize any benefit from our temporary differences and have recorded a full valuation allowance 
if we become profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net operating loss carry forward  we would immediately record the estimated net realized value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would be approximately under current tax laws 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
long lived assets we review for the impairment of long lived assets and definite life intangibles whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
if such assets are considered impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  fair value being determined based upon discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
critical estimate in and we had initiated efforts to sell the facility housing our corporate office  research and development laboratories and manufacturing plant located in east windsor  new jersey 
we have performed a review for impairment of our facility based on discussions with our real estate agent regarding the likely selling price of our facility and the commercial real estate market in general 
overestimating the potential selling price of our facility in a planned sale may lead to overstating the carrying value of the manufacturing facility by not identifying an impairment loss 
intangible assets we review for the impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  including goodwill  on an annual basis 
the first step of the impairment test requires that the company determine the fair value of each reporting unit  and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment 
the second impairment assessment involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
critical estimate application of the goodwill and intangible assets impairment test requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for the businesses  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of the company s weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
at december   we determined that the value of goodwill was impaired and a charge of  was recorded to write off the entire value of goodwill 
additionally  we recorded an impairment charge of  to write down the fair value of know how to  at december  contingent consideration in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we record the fair value of future consideration payments related to our acquisition as a liability based on the timing and probability of success of regulatory approvals and commercial milestones 
our contingent consideration liability arose in connection with the topotarget acquisition 
on a quarterly basis  we will revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings 
changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates  accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time  changes in our estimates of the likelihood of or timing of achieving any regulatory or commercial milestones 
critical estimate application of the present value calculation requires significant judgment to establish probability and timing of the event as well as the risk associated with each event 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the value of the acquired company 
the purchase consideration for topotarget contains six future milestones and two possible adjustment payments 
all eight contingencies related to the purchase have been evaluated and given a probability of occurring 
each of the contingencies has been evaluated and assigned an estimated event date at which time the liability is no longer contingent 
interest rates associated with the various risks have been used along with the estimated event date to calculate the present value of the consideration 
revenue recognition we have historically generated revenues from product sales  performance of pre clinical testing services  and other commercial arrangements such as the licensing of technology rights 
payments received under such arrangements may include non refundable fees at the inception of the arrangements  milestone payments for specific achievements designated in the agreements  royalties on sales of products  and payments for the sale of rights to future royalties 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
certain product sales are subject to rights of return 
for products sold where the buyer has the right to return the product  we recognize revenue at the time of sale only if our price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid us  or the buyer is obligated to pay us and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to us would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by us  we do not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
we recognize such product revenues on the earlier of when we have met all the above criteria  including the ability to reasonably estimate future returns  when we can reasonably estimate that the return privilege has substantially expired  or when the return privilege has substantially expired 
revenues from bio quant s performance of pre clinical services through the june  sale date are recognized according to the proportional performance method whereby revenue is recognized as performance has occurred  based on the relative outputs of the performance that has occurred up to that point in time under the respective agreement  typically the delivery of report data to our clients which documents the results of our pre clinical testing services 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company evaluated the sale of bio quant as a discontinued operation and concluded that such accounting treatment would not be appropriate 
product sales diagnostic products 
revenues from sales of diagnostic products are recognized upon delivery of products to customers  less an allowance for returns and discounts 
product sales totect  with our acquisition of topotarget  we acquired totect  which is sold primarily to third party wholesalers that  in turn  sell this product to hospitals and other dispensing organizations 
we have acquired agreements with wholesale customers and certain medical institutions throughout the united states 
these agreements customarily provide the customer with rights to return and replace the product  subject to the terms of each contract 
as of december  we have not recognized any revenue associated with this product and carry a return reserve liability to reflect an estimate of historical returns and replacements anticipated to occur on products sold prior to our acquisition on december  multiple element arrangements 
we have  in the past  entered into arrangements whereby we deliver to the customer multiple elements of revenue  such as up front payments  milestones  royalties upon sales of product  and the delivery of product and or research services to the licensee 
non refundable license fees received upon execution of license agreements where we have continuing involvement are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period of the agreement 
this requires management to estimate the expected term of the agreement or  if applicable  the estimated life of its licensed patents 
at the inception of the arrangement  we analyze the multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated 
if a product or service is not separable  the combined deliverables will be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
a delivered element can be separated from other elements when it meets both of the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
we consider licensed rights or technology to have standalone value to our customers if we or others have sold such rights or technology separately or our customers can sell such rights or technology separately without the need for our continuing involvement 
if an element can be separated  we allocate amounts based upon the relative selling price of each element 
we determine the relative selling price of a separate deliverable using the price we charge other customers when we sell that product or service separately  however  if we do not sell the product or service separately  we use the price established by management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before the separate introduction of the deliverable in the market place 
license arrangements 
license arrangements may consist of non refundable upfront license fees  milestones  royalties upon sales of product  and the delivery of product and or research services to the licensee and various performance or sales milestones 
these arrangements are often multiple element arrangements 
non refundable  up front fees that are not contingent on any future performance by us  and require no consequential continuing involvement on our part  are recognized as revenue when the license term commences and the licensed data  technology and or compound is delivered 
such deliverables may include physical quantities of compounds  design of the compounds and structure activity relationships  the conceptual framework and mechanism of action  and rights to the patents or patents pending for such compounds 
we defer recognition of non refundable upfront fees if we have continuing performance obligations without which the technology  right  product or service conveyed in conjunction with the non refundable fee has no utility to the licensee that is separate and independent of our performance under the other elements of the arrangement 
in addition  if we have required continuing involvement through research and development services that are related to our proprietary know how and expertise of the delivered technology  or can only be performed by us  then such up front fees are deferred and recognized over the period of continuing involvement 
payments related to substantive  performance based milestones in a research and development arrangement are recognized as revenues upon the achievement of the milestones as specified in the underlying agreements when they represent the culmination of the earnings process 
royalty arrangements 
we recognize royalty revenues from licensed products when earned in accordance with the terms of the license agreements 
net sales amounts generally required to be used for calculating royalties include deductions for returned product  pricing allowances  cash discounts  freight and warehousing 
royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of the related products as reported to us by our distribution partner  provided the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable and the amounts are considered collectible 
critical estimate in calculating the relative outputs of the performance that have occurred under the proportional performance method for our pre clinical testing services  we must determine whether we have delivered sufficient value to recognize a portion of the contract services revenue and to estimate what percentage of the total costs has been incurred at any given point in time 
in calculating the progress made toward completion of a research contract or licensing agreement  we must compare costs incurred to date to the total estimated cost of the project and or estimate the performance period 
we estimate the cost and or performance period of any given project based on our past experience in product development as well as the past experience of our research staff in their areas of expertise 
underestimating the proportion of final data generated for pre clinical testing services or the total cost and or performance period of a research contract or licensing agreement may cause us to accelerate the revenue recognized under such contract 
conversely  overestimating the proportion of final data for pre clinical testing services or the cost of a research contract may cause us to delay revenue recognized 
stock based compensation in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must calculate the value of stock options and restricted stock issued to employees  non employee contractors and warrants issued to investors 
the fair value of each option and warrant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model is a generally accepted method of estimating the value of stock options and warrants 
critical estimate the black scholes option pricing model requires us to estimate the company s dividend yield rate  expected volatility and risk free interest rate over the life of the option 
inaccurately estimating any one of these factors may cause the value of the option to be under or over estimated 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for the current estimates used in the black scholes pricing model 
comparison of results of operations between the years ended december  and through june   the company had two active business segments designing and developing pharmaceutical products with its nexact drug delivery technology and providing pre clinical cro services through its subsidiary  bio quant 
through june   the company aggregated sales of diagnostic products with the pre clinical cro services 
the assets and revenues were not material in relation to the company s operations as a whole  and the nature of the products and type of customer were similar to the bio quant business 
on june   the bio quant subsidiary was sold see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and accordingly the bio quant cro and diagnostic sales segment bio quant information provided for reflects the operating activity from the pre clinical cro services through the first half of the year and the sales of diagnostic products for the year ended december  on december   topotarget usa  inc was acquired with common stock and renamed apricus pharmaceuticals usa  inc apricus pharmaceuticals 
the operations of apricus pharmaceuticals will be combined with the nexmed subsidiary for the new pharmaceuticals segment 
the company determined that the nexmed and apricus pharmaceuticals businesses have a similar sales process  type of customer  regulatory environment and profit margins and  as such  should be disclosed as one segment see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
since the acquisition occurred so close to the year end  no sales or operating costs were attributable to apricus pharmaceuticals 
the assets are combined as of december  revenue 
consolidated net revenue decreased by million or  to million in as compared to million in the decrease in revenue is primarily due to the sale of bio quant see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the resulting decrease in sales in the bio quant cro and diagnostic sales bio quant segment 
bio quant segment revenues decreased million or to million in from million in the primary driver of the decrease was contract service revenue which decreased by million or to million in from million in as only six months of contract service revenue was reflected in operations in before the sale on june  as a result of the sale of bio quant  we are no longer recognizing revenues related to the bio quant s cro business 
this decrease in the bio quant segment was partially offset by increased revenue in the pharmaceuticals segment due to license fee revenue and grant revenue which increased million to million in from million in research and development expenses 
all of the research and development expenses are in the pharmaceuticals segment which increased spending by million or to million in as compared to million in due to manufacturing costs related to regulatory filings in europe for vitaros as a treatment for patients with erectile dysfunction 
we expect to continue to see an increase in manufacturing related research and development spending in as a result of the addition of marketed products in the us we will also see an increase in research and development spending as we begin to prepare for regulatory filings around the world for vitaros and our other late stage product candidates femprox  prevonco  mycova and rayva  and for granisol outside of the us and totect in canada  the us and other territories 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses were million during as compared to million during the same period in for a million or increase in spending 
the pharmaceuticals segment had general and administrative expenses of million  an increase of approximately million or from million in the increase is due primarily to increased compensation expenses associated with additional personnel to support the growing organization 
we also incurred higher expenses related to third party services for investor relations activities 
the bio quant segment reduced costs to million from million for a difference of million or 
approximately million of the reduction was due to the sale of bio quant on june  the remainder was due to general cost containment and some common costs included in the pharmaceuticals segment in loss on sale of bio quant subsidiary 
on june   we sold bio quant to biotox and incurred a non cash loss of million which was reported in the second quarter of the loss is primarily due to the disposition as part of the sale of the remaining balance of the bio quant know how and bio quant trade name in the amount of approximately million  net of amortization 
in addition to the intangible assets  we sold net assets of approximately million offset by liabilities of approximately million 
the loss resulting from the disposal of these tangible and intangible assets was computed net of the realized initial down payment received in the transaction of million 
other income expense 
we had interest expense of million during  as compared to million during the same period in  for a decrease of million or 
the interest expense during is mainly due to the interest on the million in convertible notes payable 
the interest expense in is mainly the result of interest expense recognized on the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible notes payable in as discussed in notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
non cash interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we had rental income of million during as compared to million during the same period in in  we leased our existing building to a third party and now recognize rental income on a monthly basis 
the increase in rental income in is due to the income received for the entire year in as compared to a partial period in other net income decreased by million from million of income in to million of expense in due to grant revenue was recorded in other income in net loss 
the net loss was million or per share in as compared to net loss of million or per share in there was a decrease in non cash interest expense in as discussed above  and an impairment charge to goodwill and intangible assets of million that occurred only in as discussed in notes  and of the consolidated financial statements 
these two reductions in expense were partially offset by the loss on the sale of bio quant of million as discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of results of operations between the years ended december  and during  the company had two active business segments designing and developing pharmaceutical products with its nexact drug delivery technology and providing pre clinical cro services through its subsidiary  bio quant 
the company aggregated sales of diagnostic products with the pre clinical cro services 
the assets and revenues were not material in relation to the company s operations as a whole  and the nature of the products and type of customer were similar to the bio quant business 
for most of the company operated in one segment  designing and developing pharmaceutical products with its nexact drug delivery technology 
as there was only one segment for almost all of  segment information regarding the results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was not included 
revenue 
we recorded million in revenue in  as compared to million in revenue during  an increase of million or 
the revenue is primarily attributable to the sale of the us rights of vitaros to warner chilcott as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the revenue is almost entirely attributable to the sales of cro services by our bio quant cro 
we sold bio quant on june  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as a result of the sale  we are no longer recognizing revenues related to the bio quant s cro business 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses increased million or to million in to million in while initially we began to reduce our research and development expenses in and early  we subsequently increased our research and development expenses again as a result of the acquisition of bio quant in december we expected an increase in research and development spending as a result of the acquisition of bio quant and the expansion of our nexact technology into the areas of oncology  inflammation  immunology  and metabolic diseases in addition to new delivery routes of our nexact technology 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses were million during as compared to million during the same period in the increase is due to approximately million of stock compensation expense recorded during as compared to approximately million in as restricted share grants were awarded in may and afterward 
we also incurred higher expenses in in connection with three shareholder meetings held during the first nine months of  whereas there were no such meetings in additionally  there was an increase in expenses in related to the general and administrative expenses of our bio quant cro business which was acquired in december and therefore incurred an entire year of such expenses in impairment on goodwill and intangible assets at december   we determined that the value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of bio quant was impaired and a charge of million was recorded to write off the entire value of goodwill 
additionally  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the fair value of know how to million at december  other income expense 
we had interest expense  net of million during  as compared to million during the same period in a significant amount of the interest expense is the result of non cash interest expense recognized on the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible mortgage notes and notes payable as discussed in notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
non cash interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the non cash interest expense was significantly higher in due to the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible notes payable in there was no such beneficial conversion feature related to the convertible notes payable in net loss 
the net loss was million or per share in as compared to net loss of million or per share during although there was a decrease in non cash interest expense in as discussed above  we incurred an impairment charge to goodwill and intangible assets of million as discussed in notes  and of the consolidated financial statements which offset the decrease in net loss realized from the decrease in interest expense
