item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview market conditions were difficult in several of our key markets during in particular  the market for conductive pastes used in solar applications was negatively affected by reduced end market demand and excess inventories of completed solar power modules 
as a result  our customers reduced their manufacturing volumes and lowered their demand for our conductive pastes 
lower sales of our conductive pastes caused a significant reduction in segment income for our electronic materials business that was not fully offset through higher sales of other products 
demand in other markets was mixed during demand related to automotive markets was generally improved relative to  although the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in japan during march 
table of contents did negatively impact certain customers 
demand for building materials continued to be relatively weak in certain regions as construction activity remained depressed in north america and europe 
net sales increased by compared with sales increased in performance coatings  polymer additives  color and glass performance materials  specialty plastics  and pharmaceuticals 
sales declined in electronic materials due to the reduction in demand for conductive pastes  despite an increase in sales of our non solar electronic materials products and increased precious metal sales that were driven by higher average silver prices during our consolidated net sales increases were driven by changes in product pricing and mix  with additional contributions from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these increases were partially offset by the effects of lower sales volume 
gross profit declined in compared with  primarily driven by the decline in sales of high margin conductive pastes 
raw material costs increased during the year but these changes had little net impact on gross profit as the added costs were offset by product price increases  in aggregate  across the company 
raw material cost increases were the most difficult to offset with product price increases in the performance coatings and polymer additives businesses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased slightly during compared with the prior year 
sg a expenses during included the costs of a new initiative to standardize and streamline our business processes and improve management information systems tools 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates also contributed to increased sg a expenses during the year 
reduced incentive compensation expense  lower special charges and a decline in pension expense reduced sg a expenses compared with the prior year 
restructuring and impairment charges were significantly lower in compared with the major operational activities related to our manufacturing rationalization activities  started in  were completed during the restructuring charges recorded in were primarily related to residual costs at manufacturing sites where production activities have been concluded 
during  we recorded an impairment of goodwill in the performance coatings segment and fixed asset impairment charges related to property  plant and equipment and property held for sale 
interest expense declined during primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels  reduced interest rates on borrowings and less amortization of debt issuances costs 
during  we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt related to debt refinancing 
losses on extinguishment of debt were minimal during as we continued our open market activity to redeem outstanding convertible debt 
net income increased in compared with the prior year as a result of reduced restructuring and impairment charges  reduced losses on extinguishment of debt and lower interest expense which more than offset lower gross profit and increased income tax expense 
outlook our ability to forecast future financial performance is limited because of uncertainty surrounding customer demand and economic conditions in a number of key markets and regions around the world 
customer demand for our conductive solar pastes is difficult to forecast because of uncertainty in end market demand and the continuing effects of excess inventory of solar power modules 
order levels for our solar products remain low and our visibility to future customer orders is very limited 
we expect demand for these products to improve during  but the timing and strength of the recovery in customer demand is not known at this time 
in addition  future economic conditions in europe are expected to be generally weaker in due to sovereign debt issues and other macroeconomic drivers 
this weakness may affect demand for our products in the region although the magnitude of these effects is difficult to estimate at this time 
factors that could adversely affect our future financial performance are described under the heading risk factors in item a

consignment and customer arrangements for precious metals 
we use precious metals  primarily silver  in the production of some of our products 
we obtain most precious metals from financial institutions under consignment agreements generally referred to as our precious metals consignment program 
the financial 
table of contents institutions retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign and the period of consignment 
these fees were million for at december   we had on hand precious metals owned by participants in our precious metals consignment program of million  measured at fair value based on market prices for identical assets 
we also process precious metals owned by our customers 
the consignment agreements under our precious metals program involve short term commitments that typically mature within to days of each transaction and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis 
as a result  the company relies on the continued willingness of financial institutions to participate in these arrangements to maintain this source of liquidity 
beginning in  several participants in our precious metals consignment program renewed their requirement for us to deliver cash collateral when the market value of the precious metals under consignment exceeded the lines provided by these institutions 
while we were not required to deliver cash collateral at december   we may be required to furnish cash collateral in the future based on the quantity and market value of the precious metals under consignment 
bank guarantees and standby letters of credit 
at december   the company and its subsidiaries had bank guarantees and standby letters of credit issued by financial institutions that totaled million 
these agreements primarily relate to ferro s insurance programs  foreign energy purchase contracts and foreign tax payments 
other financing arrangements we maintain other lines of credit to provide global flexibility for ferro s short term liquidity requirements 
these facilities are uncommitted lines for our international operations and totaled million at december  we had million of additional borrowings available under these lines at december  liquidity requirements our liquidity requirements primarily include debt service  purchase commitments  labor costs  working capital requirements  restructuring expenditures  capital investments  precious metals cash collateral requirements  and postretirement obligations 
we expect to meet these requirements in the long term through cash provided by operating activities and availability under existing credit facilities or other financing arrangements 
cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by earnings before noncash charges and changes in working capital needs 
in  our investing activities  mostly capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  were primarily funded by cash flows from operating activities 
we had additional borrowing capacity of million at december   and million at december   available under various credit facilities  primarily our revolving credit facility 
we have taken a variety of actions to enhance liquidity  including restructuring activities and suspension of dividend payments on our common stock 
our level of debt  debt service requirements  and ability to access credit markets could have important consequences to our business operations and uses of cash flows 
we have recently accessed the credit market for the following transactions 
in  we extended our domestic asset securitization facility  issued senior notes  which mature in  and entered into the credit facility  which matures in in  we entered into several international accounts receivable sales programs and again extended our domestic asset securitization facility 
we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
difficulties experienced in global capital markets could affect the ability or willingness of counterparties to perform under our various lines of credit  receivable sales programs  forward contracts  and precious metal 
table of contents program 
these counterparties are major  reputable  multinational institutions  all having investment grade credit ratings  except for one  which is not rated 
accordingly  we do not anticipate counterparty default 
however  an interruption in access to external financing could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition 
we assess on an ongoing basis our portfolio of businesses  as well as our financial and capital structure  to ensure that we have sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our strategic objectives 
as part of this process  from time to time we evaluate the possible divestiture of businesses that are not critical to our core strategic objectives and  where appropriate  pursue the sale of such businesses 
we also evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our strategic position 
generally  we publicly announce divestiture and acquisition transactions only when we have entered into definitive agreements relating to those transactions 
the company s aggregate amount of contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below thereafter totals dollars in thousands short term debt long term debt interest operating lease obligations purchase commitments taxes retirement and other postemployment benefits  long term debt excludes unamortized discounts on the convertible notes and imputed interest and executory costs on capitalized lease obligations 
interest represents only contractual payments for fixed rate debt 
purchased commitments are non cancelable contractual obligations for raw materials and energy 
we have not projected payments past due to uncertainties in estimating the amount and period of any payments 
we have million in gross liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits  including million of accrued interest and penalties  that are not included in the above table since we cannot reasonably predict the timing of cash settlements with various taxing authorities 
the funding amounts are based on the minimum contributions required under our various plans and applicable regulations in each respective country 
we have not projected contributions past due to uncertainties regarding the assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions 
critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
we consider the policies discussed below to be more critical than other policies because their application requires our most subjective or complex judgments 
these estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize sales typically when we ship goods to our customers and when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  
table of contents the selling price is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss has passed to our customers 
in order to ensure the revenue recognition in the proper period  we review material sales contracts for proper cut off based upon the business practices and legal requirements of each country 
for sales of products containing precious metals  we report revenues gross along with their corresponding cost of sales to arrive at gross profit 
we record revenues this way because we act as the principal in the transactions into which we enter 
restructuring and cost reduction programs between and  we developed and initiated several restructuring programs across a number of our business segments with the objectives of leveraging our global scale  realigning and lowering our cost structure  and optimizing capacity utilization 
the programs are primarily associated with north america  europe and asia pacific 
management continues to evaluate our businesses  and therefore  there may be supplemental provisions for new plan initiatives  as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded  as payments are made or actions are completed 
restructuring charges include both termination benefits and asset writedowns 
we estimate accruals for termination benefits based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions  local legal requirements  projected final service dates  and salary levels 
we also analyze the carrying value of long lived assets and record estimated accelerated depreciation through the anticipated end of the useful life of the assets affected by the restructuring or record an asset impairment 
in all likelihood  this accelerated depreciation will result in reducing the net book value of those assets to zero at the date operations cease 
while we believe that changes to our estimates are unlikely  the accuracy of our estimates depends on the successful completion of numerous actions 
delays in moving continuing operations to other facilities or increased cash outlays will increase our restructuring costs to such an extent that it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
other events  such as a delay in completion of construction of new facilities  may also delay the resulting cost savings 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment each year using a measurement date of october st or more frequently in the event of an impairment indicator 
we estimate the fair values of the reporting units associated with these assets using the average of both the income approach and the market approach  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of the reporting units fair values  unless facts and circumstances exist that indicate more representative fair values 
the income approach uses projected cash flows attributable to the reporting units over their useful lives and allocates certain corporate expenses to the reporting units 
we use historical results  trends and our projections of market growth  internal sales efforts and anticipated cost structure assumptions to estimate future cash flows 
using a risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital  we discount the cash flow projections to the measurement date 
the market approach estimates a price reasonably expected to be paid by a market participant in the purchase of similar businesses 
if the fair value of any of the reporting units were determined to be less than its carrying value  we would proceed to the second step and obtain comparable market values or independent appraisals of its assets to determine the amount of any impairment 
the significant assumptions and ranges of assumptions we used in our impairment analysis of goodwill were as follows significant assumptions weighted average cost of capital residual growth rate 
table of contents our estimates of fair value can be adversely affected by a variety of factors 
reductions in actual or projected growth or profitability at our reporting units due to unfavorable market conditions or significant increases in cost structure could lead to the impairment of any related goodwill 
additionally  an increase in inflation  interest rates or the risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital could also lead to a reduction in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units and therefore lead to the impairment of goodwill 
for purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis in  we reassessed our reporting units and determined that there are eight groups that qualify as reporting units under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  and therefore we allocated goodwill formerly carried at the color and glass performance materials reporting unit to the glass systems and performance pigments and colors reporting units  using their relative fair values at the measurement date 
based on our impairment test  we recognized an impairment loss of million in our tile coating systems reporting unit 
for the remaining reporting units tested for impairment during  the fair values exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units by amounts ranging from to at the measurement date 
a future potential impairment is possible for any of these reporting units if actual results are materially less than forecasted results 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our cash flows and  as a result  not support the carrying values of our reporting units are new environmental regulations or legal restrictions on the use of our products that would either reduce our product revenues or add substantial costs to the manufacturing process  thereby reducing operating margins  new technologies that could make our products less competitive or require substantial capital investment in new equipment or manufacturing processes  and substantial downturns in economic conditions 
income taxes the breadth of our operations and complexity of income tax regulations require us to assess uncertainties and make judgments in estimating the ultimate amount of income taxes we will pay 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid 
the final income taxes we pay are based upon many factors  including existing income tax laws and regulations  negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  outcomes of tax litigation  and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international income tax audits 
the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to our income tax assets and liabilities in the future 
deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we adjust our deferred income tax assets and liabilities for changes in income tax rates and income tax laws when changes are enacted 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets 
the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income  our ability to carry back or carry forward net operating losses and credits to offset tax liabilities in a prior year  as well as successful implementation of various tax strategies to generate tax where net operating losses or credit carryforwards exist 
in evaluating our ability to realize the deferred income tax assets  we rely principally on the reversal of existing temporary differences  the availability of tax planning strategies  and forecasted income 
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax positions is subject to management s assessment of relevant risks  facts  and circumstances existing at that time 
we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured based on a more likely than not threshold and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the tax return 
to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
we report tax related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 

table of contents derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and precious metal prices 
the accounting for derivative financial instruments can be complex and can require significant judgment 
generally  the derivative financial instruments that we use are not complex  and observable market based inputs are available to measure their fair value 
we do not engage in speculative transactions for trading purposes 
financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  expose us to counterparty credit risk for non performance 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we enter into these derivative financial instruments with major  reputable  multinational financial institutions 
accordingly  we do not anticipate counter party default 
we continuously evaluate the effectiveness of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges to ensure that they are highly effective 
in the event the hedge becomes ineffective  we discontinue hedge treatment 
except as noted below  we do not expect any changes in our risk policies or in the nature of the transactions we enter into to mitigate those risks 
our exposure to interest rate changes arises from our debt agreements with variable market interest rates 
to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  we had entered into interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps effectively converted a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
in  in conjunction with repayment of our remaining outstanding term loans  we settled these swaps 
we manage foreign currency risks in a wide variety of foreign currencies principally by entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions arising from international trade 
our objective in entering into these forward contracts is to preserve the economic value of non functional currency cash flows 
our principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling  the japanese yen  and the chinese yuan 
we mark these forward contracts to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other income or expense from foreign currency transactions 
precious metals primarily silver  gold  platinum and palladium represent a significant portion of raw material costs in our electronic materials products 
we also use precious metals in our color and glass performance materials products 
when we enter into a fixed price sales contract at the customer s request to establish the price for the precious metals content of the order  we also enter into a forward purchase arrangement with a precious metals supplier to completely cover the value of the precious metals content 
our current precious metal contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
we also purchase portions of our energy requirements  including natural gas and electricity  under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of cost changes 
our current energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor defined benefit plans in the us and many countries outside the us  and we also sponsor retiree medical benefits for a segment of our salaried and hourly work force within the us the us pension plans represent approximately of pension plan assets  of benefit obligations and of net periodic pension cost 
the assumptions we use in actuarial calculations for these plans have a significant impact on benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs 
we meet with our actuaries annually to discuss key economic assumptions used to develop these benefit obligations and net periodic costs 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

table of contents we determine the discount rate for the us pension and retiree medical plans based on a bond model 
using the pension plans projected cash flows  the bond model considers all possible bond portfolios that produce matching cash flows and selects the portfolio with the highest possible yield 
these portfolios are based on bonds with a quality rating of aa or better under either moody s investor services  inc or standard poor s rating group  but exclude certain bonds  such as callable bonds  bonds with small amounts outstanding  and bonds with unusually high or low yields 
the discount rates for the non us plans are based on a yield curve method  using aa rated bonds applicable in respective capital markets 
the duration of each plan s liabilities is used to select the rate from the yield curve corresponding to the same duration 
for the market related value of plan assets  we use fair value  rather than a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over several years 
we calculate the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year for defined benefit plans as the weighted average of the expected return for the target allocation of the principal asset classes held by each of the plans 
in determining the expected returns  we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return 
the company consults with and considers the opinion of its actuaries in developing appropriate return assumptions 
our target asset allocation percentages are fixed income and equity investments for us plans and fixed income  equity  and other investments for non us plans 
in  investment returns on average plan assets were approximately within us plans and within non us plans 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment allocation and performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
all other assumptions are reviewed periodically by our actuaries and us and may be adjusted based on current trends and expectations as well as past experience in the plans 
the following table provides the sensitivity of net annual periodic benefit costs for our pension plans  including a us nonqualified retirement plan  and the retiree medical plan to a basis point decrease in both the discount rate and asset return assumption basis point decrease in discount rate basis point decrease in asset return assumption dollars in thousands us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans total the following table provides the rates used in the assumptions and the changes between and change discount rate used to measure benefit cost us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans discount rate used to measure benefit obligations us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans expected return on plan assets us pension plans non us pension plans 
table of contents our overall net periodic benefit cost for all defined benefit plans decreased million to million in from million in in  we recorded million of one time net curtailment and settlement losses 
in addition  interest cost for decreased by million  primarily due to lower benefit obligations resulting from the curtailments and settlements 
for  we expect our overall net periodic benefit cost to increase approximately million to million 
the increase is a result of the effects of lower discount rates  lower expected returns on plan assets  and worse than expected asset performance in inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined utilizing the first in  first out fifo method 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of inventories based primarily upon their age  but also upon assumptions of future usage in production  customer demand and market conditions 
inventories have been reduced to the lower of cost or realizable value by allowances for slow moving or obsolete goods 
if actual circumstances are less favorable than those projected by management in its evaluation of the net realizable value of inventories  additional write downs may be required 
slow moving  excess or obsolete materials are specifically identified and may be physically separated from other materials  and we rework or dispose of these materials as time and manpower permit 
environmental liabilities our manufacturing facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate 
the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future 
we expense these recurring costs as they are incurred 
while these costs may increase in the future  they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we also accrue for environmental remediation costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount 
we determine the timing and amount of any liability based upon assumptions regarding future events 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
we adjust these liabilities periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
impact of newly issued accounting pronouncements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k for a discussion of accounting standards we recently adopted or will be required to adopt 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to instruments that are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and costs of raw materials and energy 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises from our debt portfolio 
we manage this risk by controlling the mix of fixed versus variable rate debt after considering the interest rate environment and expected future cash flows 
our objective is to limit variability in earnings  cash flows and overall borrowing costs caused by changes in interest rates  while preserving operating flexibility 
we operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions expose us to gains and losses arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are 
table of contents recorded and the dates they are settled 
we manage this risk by entering into forward currency contracts that offset these gains and losses 
we are subject to cost changes with respect to our raw materials and energy purchases 
we attempt to mitigate raw materials cost increases through product reformulations  price increases  and other productivity improvements 
we enter into forward purchase arrangements with precious metals suppliers to completely cover the value of the precious metals content of fixed price sales contracts 
these agreements are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market  and had purchase commitments totaling million at december  in addition  we purchase portions of our natural gas and electricity requirements under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of these costs 
these energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market  and had purchase commitments totaling million at december  the notional amounts  carrying amounts of assets liabilities  and fair values associated with our exposure to these market risks and sensitivity analyses about potential gains losses resulting from hypothetical changes in market rates are presented below dollars in thousands variable rate debt and utilization of asset securitization program change in annual interest expense from change in interest rates fixed rate debt carrying amount fair value change in fair value from increase in interest rate change in fair value from decrease in interest rate foreign currency forward contracts notional amount carrying amount and fair value change in fair value from appreciation of us dollar change in fair value from depreciation of us dollar
