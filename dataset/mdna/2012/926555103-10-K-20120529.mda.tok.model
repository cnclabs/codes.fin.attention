item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have reclassified management s discussion and analysis for all periods presented to reflect the consolidated financial results of our fox international ltd 
as discontinued operations 
see results of operations discontinued operations later in this item for more information 
additionally  as fox international  ltd 
represented our entire wholesale segment  we have also reflected that change by presenting all periods in one reportable segment 
unless otherwise noted  discussions below pertain to our continuing operations 
overview the company is a worldwide leader in the manufacturing and distribution of a wide range of display devices  encompassing  among others  industrial  military  medical  and simulation display solutions 
the company is comprised of one segment the manufacturing and distribution of displays and display components 
the company is organized into four interrelated operations aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to the aggregation criteria of fasb asc topic segment reporting monitors offers a wide range of crt  flat panel and projection display systems for use in training and simulation  military  medical  and industrial applications 
data display crts offers a wide range of crts for use in data display screens  including computer terminal monitors and medical monitoring equipment 
entertainment crts offers a wide range of crts and projection tubes for television and home theater equipment 
component parts provides replacement electron guns and other components for crts primarily for servicing the company s internal needs 
during fiscal  management of the company focused key resources on strategic efforts to dispose of unprofitable operations and seeking acquisition opportunities that enhance the profitability and sales growth of the company s more profitable product lines 
the company continues to seek new products through acquisitions and internal development that complement existing profitable product lines 
challenges facing the company during these efforts include inventory management the company continually monitors historical sales trends as well as projected needs to ensure adequate on hand supplies of inventory and to ensure against overstocking of slower moving  obsolete items 
certain of the company s divisions maintain significant inventories of crts and component parts in an effort to ensure its customers a reliable source of supply 
the company s inventory turnover averaged days during  although in many cases the company would anticipate holding to days of inventory in the normal course of operations 
this level of inventory is higher than some of the company s competitors because it sells a number of products representing older  or trailing edge  technology that may not be available from other sources 
the company also maintains inventory for warranty repairs and replacements for products out in the field which are no longer in its current products 
in the monitor operations of the company s business  the market for its products is characterized by rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the flat panel display area 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers or accurately forecast their requirements  it may accumulate inventories of products which its customers no longer need and which the company will be unable to sell or return to its vendors 
the company s management monitors the adequacy of its inventory reserves regularly  and at february   believes its reserves to be adequate 
interest rate exposure the company had outstanding debt of approximately million and million  as of february  and february   respectively  subject to interest rate fluctuations by the company s lenders 
variable interest rates on the company s loans and the potential for rate hikes could negatively affect the company s future earnings 
it is the intent of the company to continually monitor interest rates and consider converting portions of the company s debt from floating rates to fixed rates should conditions be favorable for such interest rate swaps or hedges 

table of contents operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the company s consolidated statements of operations bear to total revenues amounts in thousands see item business description of principal business and principal products for discussion about the company s products and divisions 
amount amount net sales monitors data display crts entertainment crts component parts total company costs and expenses cost of goods sold selling and delivery general and administrative income from operations interest expense other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales increased million or to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the company s business is more concentrated in the monitor division of the company where all the new growth is occurring as the market for crts declines and moves to newer technologies 
the company is now a video display solutions company  while it still services the existing crt markets  which overall account for approximately of the company s revenues 
the monitor revenues increased million due to growth of long term contracts at aydin displays and z axis which experienced tremendous growth in its custom manufacturing and power supply sales due to new business 
overall  aydin displays revenues increased over the prior fiscal year to million and z axis increased in net revenues to million over the prior fiscal year 
display systems business was down from the prior fiscal year as it finished out a multi year contract for the us marine corps at the start of the fiscal year and due to changes in the projector industry which affected the sales of its crt projectors 
lexel experienced a decline in revenues due to a decline in orders for various types of its crt business 
lexel is expected to rebound in fiscal due to foreign sales projections which were down in fiscal data display crt sales in fiscal declined due to decreased demand in the crt market including the division s largest customer 
sales are expected to improve with the customer as they were working down their inventory levels in fiscal 
table of contents entertainment crt and component parts net sales declined by a combined in fiscal compared to fiscal the two divisions represent only of the company s revenues for fiscal due to the continued shift to flat screen televisions  the market for replacement crts in the consumer market has diminished 
the company is winding down its business in replacement crts for the consumer market and indeed this is a small fraction of the company s overall business 
component parts sales have generally declined in recent years due to weaker demand for electron gun and stem sales 
this business will continue to decline as the crt industry moves to the new technologies 
the division primarily supplies the other divisions with parts they need to complete the assembly of their products 
gross margins consolidated gross margins increased to for fiscal from for fiscal overall gross margin dollars increased by million or versus the prior fiscal year 
the only division which experienced an increase in gross margin percentage and dollars was the monitor division 
the product mix of the division changed due to increases in flat panel displays and custom manufacturing 
the margins for the monitor division improved as the divisions revenues increased and better efficiencies were achieved within their operations due to better utilization of capacity and equipment upgrades at z axis 
the monitor division gross margin dollars increased million or over the prior fiscal year 
the gross margin percentages also increased from in fiscal to in fiscal data display crt gross margin dollars decreased by for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in margin dollars was due to a decrease in market demand for crt products and costs associated with closing the company s clinton display systems facility in the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year 
gross margins in entertainment crts decreased in fiscal from the prior year due to the decrease in sales volume of high margin products at the company s louisiana facility and the chroma division 
the chroma division was closed in the company s second quarter 
gross margins from component parts decreased in fiscal due to low sales volume and the inability to cover fixed costs 
the division primarily exists to service and supply parts to other divisions within the company 
gross margins for these divisions represented less than of the company s gross margin dollars 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily reflecting increases in salaries  legal fees  research and development and professional services 
the higher salaries are attributable to increases in commission due to higher sales volumes and additional sales people including the new division  aydin visual solutions 
the increased legal fees and professional services are for services in the sale of the fox subsidiary  the settlement of the clinton displays dispute see note  certain government contract issues  and acquisition issues 
finally  research and development costs increased as the company increased its work on new products 
plant closure as of february  the company closed its clinton displays facility in loves park  illinois  a manufacturer of crts 
the remaining inventory and crt related operations were moved to the company s lexel imaging systems subsidiary in lexington  ky 
where they will continue to be manufactured and its data displays distribution facility in tucker  ga 
the operating losses generated by clinton displays for the years ended february  and february  were approximately  thousand and thousand and are included in the company s results from operations 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal overall  interest expense decreased by million as the company reduced debt by nearly million during the current fiscal year 
this was achieved by the increased profitability of the company  better use of its assets and paying off higher interest debt 
the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 

table of contents income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the lower effective rate in was primarily due to research and experimentation credits  the domestic production activities deduction  and various other permanent items 
discontinued operations on march   the company sold its fox international ltd 
subsidiary to fi acquisitions  a company owned by video display s chief executive officer 
we accounted for this disposition as discontinued operations  and  accordingly  we have reclassified the consolidated financial results for all periods presented to reflect them as such

the company s working capital was and million at february  and february   respectively 
in recent years  the company has financed its growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations  borrowings under revolving credit facilities  borrowings from its ceo and long term debt 
the company specializes in certain products representing trailing edge technology that may not be available from other sources  and may not be manufactured currently 
in many instances  the company s products are components of larger display systems for which immediate availability is critical for the customer 
accordingly  the company enjoys higher gross margins  but typically has larger investments in inventories than those of its competitors 

table of contents the company continually monitors its cash and financing positions in order to find ways to lower its interest costs and to produce positive operating cash flow 
the company examines possibilities to grow its business through internal sales growth or niche acquisitions 
there could be an impact on working capital requirements to fund this growth

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts  contract revenue recognition as well as profitability or loss recognition estimates and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory falls below its carrying amount 
management attempts to determine by historical usage analysis and numerous other market factors  the projected demand for crts in this estimate of net realizable value 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management reviews inventory levels on a quarterly basis 
such reviews include observations of product development trends of the oems  new products being marketed and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the company s existing inventories 
there have been no significant changes in management s estimates in fiscal and  however  the company cannot guarantee the accuracy of future forecasts since these estimates are subject to change based on market conditions 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million and million at february  and february   respectively 
during fiscal and  the company disposed of million and million of inventory  respectively 
the increase in disposals during was due to several factors 
million of inventory was disposed of at the company s clinton displays facility  million was disposed of after the settlement agreement was reached with clinton electronics corporation see note and the remainder when the company closed the plant in february data display disposed of million with the majority of the disposals being attributed to inventory it acquired from the company s former subsidiary  fox international  ltd  inc before its sale to fi acquisition  llc on march  see note 
the company s aydin displays and vdcds divisions each disposed of million 
other divisions disposed of million of inventory 
of the million of inventory disposed of during the year  million was previously included in the inventory reserve and million was previously accrued in conjunction with the clinton settlement 
analysis of the inventory determined there was no longer a need for some of the inventory and it was better to dispose of it for tax purposes and free up valuable space 
revenue and profit or loss recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable and collect ability can be reasonably assured 
the company s delivery term typically is fob shipping point 
in accordance with fasb asc topic revenue recognition principal agent considerations  shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of income 
shipping and handling costs incurred for the delivery of product to customers are classified in selling and delivery in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents a portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts to manufacture display systems to a buyer s specification 
these contracts are accounted for under the provisions of fasb asc topic revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts 
these contracts are fixed price and cost plus contracts and are recorded on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
with respect to contract change orders  claims  or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for bad debts is determined by reviewing all accounts receivable and applying credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors as well as payment history and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
historically  the company s allowance has been sufficient for any customer write offs 
although the company cannot guarantee future results  management believes its policies and procedures relating to customer exposure are adequate 
warranty reserves the warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a reserve based on claims experience 
the company considers actual warranty claims compared to net sales  then adjusts its reserve liability accordingly 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
management feels that historically its procedures have been adequate and does not anticipate that its assumptions are reasonably likely to change in the future 
other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
discontinued operations on march   the company sold its fox international ltd 
subsidiary to fi acquisitions  a company majority owned by the company s chief executive officer 
the company put its fox international ltd 
subsidiary up for auction on january  and gave all interested parties a thirty day due diligence period  which was later extended until march   to give any potential bidders more time 
fi acquisitions was the only bidder and paid the net book value  approximately million  for fox international ltd 
in a stock sale  satisfied by the company s chief executive officer exchanging  of his personally owned shares of the company s stock valued at approximately million and approximately  in cash 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired and accounted for under the purchase method 
under this standard  goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized and evaluated annually for impairment 
if the company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  then it applies the processes prescribed in fasb asc topic intangible assets and fasb asc topic property  plant  and equipment 
we make certain estimates and projections in connection with impairment analyses for goodwill and other long term assets 
if these estimates or projections change or prove incorrect  we may be required to record impairment charges 
if these impairment charges were significant  our consolidated financial position or results of operations would be adversely affected 
management has assessed the company s intangible assets and has not recognized any impairment of assets for the twelve months ended february  income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions under the provisions of asc topic  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of asc topic asc topic 
asc topic contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not  that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount  which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating the company s tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments 
at february   the company did not record any liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued revised guidance fasb asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
the amendment permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted and the company has chosen early adoption 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships  such as prime to libor spreads 
approximately million of outstanding debt at february  related to long term indebtedness under variable rate debt 
interest on the outstanding balance of this debt will be charged based on a variable rate related to the prime rate or the libor rate 
both rate bases are incremented for margins specified in their agreements 
thus  the company s interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase across all maturities of variable rate debt would result in a decrease of approximately  in pre tax income assuming no further changes in the amount of borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at february  the company does not trade in derivative financial instruments
