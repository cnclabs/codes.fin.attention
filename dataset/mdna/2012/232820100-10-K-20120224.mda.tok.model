in addition  on june   we commenced offers to purchase our notes due october  and our notes due july  in july  we applied the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes and corporate cash to repurchase principal amount of our notes due october  for a purchase price of plus accrued interest of and principal amount of our notes due july  for a purchase price of we raised the additional debt and launched the tender offer to improve our debt maturity profile and further mitigate any liquidity concerns associated with debt maturities 
the repurchase of the notes through the tender offer resulted in a net loss of  including transaction costs  recognized in the third quarter of funding of future cash requirements we believe that we have the ability to fund our operating cash requirements and planned capital expenditures as well as the ability to meet our debt service requirements for the foreseeable future from existing cash and from internal cash generation 
however  from time to time  based on such factors as local tax regulations  prevailing interest rates and our plans for capital investment or other investments  it may make economic sense to utilize our existing credit lines in order to meet those cash requirements  which may include debt service related disbursements 
we are required to meet financial ratios under our five year revolving credit agreement  including a maximum permitted ratio of total consolidated debt as defined to consolidated ebitda as defined and a minimum consolidated ebitda as defined to interest expense ratio 
complying with these ratios could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 
our ability to comply with the covenants will depend on our future operating performance 
if we fail to comply with those covenants and terms  we will be in default 
in this case  we would be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance 
if we were unable to obtain any necessary waivers  the amounts outstanding under this agreement could be accelerated  and become immediately due and payable  and we would not be able to borrow any additional funds under the agreement while such default continued 
we are in compliance with these covenants and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future 
we have no borrowings outstanding under the agreement as of december  our ability to fully utilize our revolving credit agreement can be limited by our actual calculated debt covenant ratio as compared to the maximum debt covenant ratio permitted under the agreement 
at december  the full amount of the facility is available to us  and we expect that the full amount will continue to be available based on our current forecasts 
use of cash we have generated a significant amount of cash in recent years 
going into  our use of cash priority will be to invest in the typical maintenance of business capital spending projects and pension contributions 
this is followed by expansion cost reduction capital in our growth product lines and fast payback margin improvement capital in our cash product lines 
in addition  if available at a reasonable price  we will pursue bolt on acquisitions for our growth product lines 
we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases when it is prudent to do so 
we have approximately of buyback authorized as of december  we also will continue to pursue debt reductions when available at a reasonable price 
we have not guaranteed any indebtedness of our unconsolidated associated company 
inflation at this time is not considered significant although higher costs for energy and commodities could impact our future operating expenses and capital spending

the instruments are typically renewed on an annual basis 
we do not have any unconsolidated limited purpose entities or any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
currencies are in millions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  we may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with our established policies 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
moreover  we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
currency risk we periodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity 
at december   the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable and accounts payable 
when hedging currency exposures  our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
at december   the currency and net notional amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into us dollar equivalent amounts were as follows december  buy sell us dollar euro chilean peso canadian dollar australian dollar thai baht mexican peso pound sterling norwegian krone us dollar brazilian real norwegian krone pound sterling others the net unfavorable fair value of currency contracts  based on exchange rates at december   was assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would decrease by approximately however  since these contracts hedge specific transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
we use cross currency swaps ten year swaps to hedge the value of one of our us subsidiaries net investment in our belgium based subsidiary  cytec surface specialties sa nv  against the risk of adverse foreign exchange movements in the usd value of the euro  which is designated as a net investment hedge 
the total notional amount of the ten year swaps is we pay per annum on the euro notional amount and receive per annum on the usd notional amount on each april and october  through the maturity date of the swap  which is on october  since the critical terms of the ten year swaps match the critical terms of the net investment in cytec surface specialties sa nv  the ten year swaps are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the value of the net investment attributable to the change in usd value of the euro 
at december  and  the unfavorable fair value of the ten year swaps was and  respectively 
assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the euro exchange rate would cause an increase decrease of approximately in the total value of the hedging instrument referred to above 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a contract for the construction of certain manufacturing equipment  the payments of which are denominated in swiss francs chf and will total approximately chf  exposing us to exchange rate fluctuations between chf and usd 
to hedge this risk  we entered into forward contracts to buy chf and sell usd at agreed upon rates  and designated these currency forwards as a cash flow hedge of the foreign currency risks associated with our capitalization of the chf denominated invoices 
at hedge inception  we expected that the hedging relationship would be highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged because the key features and terms ie  the currency  notional amount  and timing for the forward and the respective hedged transactions closely match at inception 
as of december   the notional amount of the forward contracts designated as a cash flow hedge is approximately  and the unrealized loss as of december  is approximately assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the chf exchange rate would cause an increase decrease of approximately in the total value of this hedging instrument 
interest rate risk at december   our outstanding borrowings consisted of of short term variable rate borrowings and long term fixed rate debt  which had a carrying value of  a face value of and a fair value  of the fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates the contractual terms of the notes and observable market based inputs that include time value  interest rate curves  and credit spreads 
assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the weighted average prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of december   interest expense would increase decrease by approximately for the next fiscal year and the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease increase by approximately significant accounting estimates critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition 
share based compensation us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires recognition of compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments 
compensation cost for performance stock is recorded based on the market value on the original date of grant which is the fair value 
compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in cash cash settled sars is recognized based on the fair value of the award at the end of each period through the date of settlement 
compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in shares stock settled sars and stock options is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant 
gaap also requires that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share based awards 
we monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
the estimated fair values are based on assumptions  including estimated lives of the instruments  historical and implied volatility  dividend yield on our common stock  and risk free interest rates 
we also consider the probability that the options and stock settled sars will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder 
these assumptions are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors 
changes in assumptions from period to period may materially affect the amount of share based compensation cost we recognize in income 
environmental and other contingent liabilities accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accruals are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities  without any discount to reflect the time value of money 
these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
the amount accrued for environmental remediation reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature and cost of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the 
table of contents number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
included in other contingent liabilities are workers compensation  product liability and toxic tort claims 
the amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects our assumptions about the incidence  severity  indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims 
our asbestos related contingent liabilities and related insurance receivables are based on a study  which is prepared every three years by a third party 
our last study was prepared during the third quarter of and we expect the next study will be prepared during the third quarter of the study estimates our gross asbestos liabilities using a frequency severity approach 
with this approach  the cost of future claim filings due to asbestos related diseases are estimated as the product of the future number of claims filed and the average value of those claims on a nominal as opposed to discounted basis 
future claim frequency is estimated using our claims history and the stallard manton epidemiological decay model the decay model  a widely used industry study 
the decay model assumes that future levels of claims activity will gradually decrease from current levels by applying model specific decay factors that project this claim activity to wind down over the next to years 
our current levels are estimated based on our risk profile and our historical claim experience 
the estimated cost per claim is based on our historical paid claims adjusted for inflation 
although these estimates and assumptions are based on reasonable facts  they are subject to change based on the actual outcome and a variety of external factors 
a sustained change in the annual number of future asbestos claims filed against us will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by and  respectively 
a sustained change in the average value of asbestos claims paid will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by and  respectively 
accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if our assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties 
we cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts 
moreover  environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period  and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty 
accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses 
probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future indemnity costs are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets 
a number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements 
these factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies  how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies  the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships  and historical recovery rates over the past ten years 
defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred 
insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are recognized when the recovery is probable and related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets 
retirement plans we sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements 
our most significant pension plans are in the us  and constituted over of our consolidated pension assets and of projected benefit obligations as of december  the calculation of our pension expense and pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
we believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rates 
our us salaried pension plan was frozen on december  at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities 
in estimating this rate  we look at the yields on high quality  long term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
future expected actuarially determined cash flows of our major us plans are matched against a yield curve encompassing such bonds to arrive at a single discount rate by plan 
we discounted our us future pension and postretirement medical liabilities using a rate of and  respectively  at december  the discount rate used to determine the 
table of contents value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense 
a increase to the discount rate for our us pension plans would decrease our expected annual expense by and decrease our liability by a decrease to the discount rate for our us pension plans would increase our expected annual expense by and increase our liability by a increase to the discount rate for our postretirement medical plan would decrease our expected annual expense by and decrease our liability by a decrease to the discount rate for our us postretirement medical plan would increase our expected annual expense by and increase our liability by in order to reduce the volatility of our pension plan assets relative to pension liabilities  over the past eighteen months we have gradually implemented a liability driven investment ldi strategy for our us  us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
as part of the strategy  we have transitioned some of our equity allocation to longer term fixed income assets with an emphasis on high quality corporate bonds 
as the funded status of the plans improves  we expect to further decrease equity investments and increase fixed income investments 
as a result of these changes  the expected rates of return have been adjusted downward  as appropriate  to reflect the new allocations 
the expected rate of return on our us plan assets  which was for  reflects the long term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
we establish the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to us at that time  including the historical returns of major asset classes  the expected investment mix of the plans assets  and estimates of future long term investment returns 
a change to the expected rate of return on plan assets of our us pension plans would increase or decrease our expected pension expense by  the expected postretirement medical expense would increase or decrease by the pension plans investment mix at december  approximated equities and fixed income securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized into pension expense in accordance with gaap 
the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits healthcare cost trend rate is in  decreasing to ultimate trend of in the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo and related expense 
a decrease to the assumed healthcare cost trend rate for our postretirement benefit plans would decrease our expense by and decrease our postretirement benefit obligation by a increase to the assumed healthcare cost trend rate for our postretirement benefit plans would increase our expense by and increase our postretirement benefit obligation by impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we have defined our segments as our reporting units 
our four business segments are engineered materials  in process separation  additive technologies  and coating resins 
engineered materials serves principally aerospace markets 
in process separation and additive technologies serve large  global industrial markets 
coating resins serves the large  global coatings market 
the segments above reflect how we run our company  manage the assets  and view our customers 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
we use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
we initially use a market multiple approach a to estimate a range of fair values by reporting unit  and then use a discounted cash flow approach b if the market multiple approach indicates that a potential impairment might exist to refine and reaffirm the results of the first test 
the market multiple approach provides a straightforward  cost effective and relatively simple method to readily determine if an impairment might exist by utilizing ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization information by reporting unit multiplied by average current industry valuation factors or multiples to easily determine an estimated range of fair value 
due to the cyclical nature of our reporting units  we utilize a three year ebitda average of historical and forecasted ebitda for the reportable segment times the range of ebitda multiple factors 
the three year period is comprised of the prior year  current year and one year projected amounts 
the market multiple range utilizes an average lower and upper multiple limit based on recent industry acquisition average ebitda multiples paid by financial and strategic purchasers 
we obtain this information from a third party investment bank 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value using the low end of the range is close to  in our judgment  or 
table of contents below the reporting unit s carrying value  we refine the calculation using cash flows to calculate a point estimate of the reporting unit s fair value  as opposed to a range 
if the discounted cash flow approach yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting unit s carrying value  we would proceed to step two of the impairment test 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test 
for the market multiple approach  we used an ebitda range of between x and x 
all of our reporting units passed step a with the exception of the coating resins reporting unit 
the coating resins ebitda of was a three year average of the actual  actual or forecast  and the budgeted ebitda amounts 
the market multiple approach step a for the coating resins reporting unit resulted in a fair value range of to  since the carrying value was in excess of the lower end of the range of the estimated fair values using the multiples  we refined the estimate of the fair value using a discounted cash flow approach in accordance with our aforementioned policy which resulted in a fair value of  the discounted cash flow approach fair value exceeded the carrying value by  or  indicating that there was no impairment of coating resins goodwill 
the discounted cash flow approach considered a weighted average cost of capital wacc rate of as the discount rate and an estimated net cash flow for a ten year period from to the wacc calculation considered a risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premium 
the risk free rate of return equaled the yield on long term united states treasury bonds 
the cost of debt represented the yield of a bbb rated bond 
the cost of equity included an estimate of the return on typical long term investments required to induce investment in a diversified portfolio of us publicly traded stocks adjusted for specific risk and size premiums of the reporting unit 
the risk premium reflects the specific risks associated with the current business and future performance estimates 
the cost of equity and debt were weighted based on the observed capital structures of companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit 
the discounted cash flow model also reflects a terminal value that assumes net cash flows will continue to grow at a rate of in perpetuity  which we believe is reasonable for this business 
these evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
the discounted cash flows were based on a ten year projection  covering through the to projections take into account current macroeconomic conditions and reflect management s best estimate of the amount of time required before the business recovers from the current recessionary environment 
the to amounts were based on forecasted average revenue growth factor of approximately 
the projections included average annual capital expenditures of and net working capital increases corresponding to the revenue growth assumed 
we assumed an average tax rate of for the discounted cash flow approach which we believe is a realistic approximation of our future annual effective tax rate for this business 
the following table summarizes the approximate impact that a change in certain critical assumptions would have on the goodwill impairment 
the approximate impact of the change in each critical assumption assumes all other assumptions and factors remain constant 
critical factors change approximate increase decrease on fair value weighted average cost of capital weighted average cost of capital terminal value growth rate terminal value growth rate annual capital expenditures annual capital expenditures annual sales volume growth rate annual sales volume growth rate operating profit margin operating profit margin because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we are not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment 

table of contents intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed long lived assets  including those to be disposed  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
depreciation depreciation is provided on either the straight line or the straight line composite method 
certain assets in the united states and all assets outside the united states and canada are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
when these assets are retired or disposed of  the net book value of assets are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the net gain or loss is included in the determination of earnings from operations 
depreciation for the remainder of our assets in the united states and canada is recorded primarily on a straight line composite method over the estimated useful lives of various classes of assets  with rates periodically reviewed and adjusted if necessary 
when such depreciable assets are sold or otherwise retired from service  unless a major change in the composition of an asset class has occurred  their costs plus demolition costs less amounts realized on sale or salvage are charged or credited to the accumulated depreciation account 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to current operating expenses 
acquisitions  additions and betterments  either to provide necessary capacity  improve the efficiency of production units  modernize or replace older facilities or to install equipment for protection of the environment  are capitalized 
we capitalize interest costs incurred during the period of construction of plants and equipment 
we are in the process of completing our review of our accounting policies related to the composite method of depreciation including our estimates of useful lives to determine if another depreciation method allowed under gaap may be preferable 
if we determine that another depreciation method is preferred under gaap  we will change our accounting policies to the more preferred method 
we anticipate that our review will be finalized during the first quarter of and that we would account for any such change on a prospective basis as a change in estimate in accordance with gaap 
based on our analysis to date  we do not believe such changes  if any  would be material to our future financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
we intend to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us or additional non us taxes with respect to these earnings 
in the event of repatriation to the us  such earnings would be subject to us income taxes in most cases 
foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of us tax otherwise payable in future years 
our annual effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required 
table of contents in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish accruals for tax contingencies when  notwithstanding the reasonable belief that our tax return positions are fully supported  we believe that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover  that such filing positions may not be fully sustained 
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
we continually evaluate our uncertain tax positions and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances including but not limited to emerging case law  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the period of resolution 
our accruals for gross uncertain tax positions are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable and other noncurrent liabilities 
derivative financial instruments and certain hedging activities we use derivative instruments in accordance with our established policies to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates  interest rates and  when appropriate  natural gas prices in north america 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
foreign currency risk we use currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in currency rates on third party and intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity 
we hedge such exposures with currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps denominated in the same currency and with similar terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item or transaction 
all derivative contracts used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in fair value are reported in earnings or deferred  depending on the nature and effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
ineffectiveness  if any  in a hedging relationship is recognized immediately into earnings 
if the hedging relationship is not highly effective in generating offsetting cash flows or changes in fair value  we would recognize the change in the fair value of the currency forward contract in other income expense  net 
there was no ineffectiveness in   or we used cross currency swaps to hedge certain future cash flows from euro receipts on certain euro denominated intercompany loans receivable we had with certain subsidiaries against changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rates 
the swaps fixed the us dollar equivalent cash flows of these euro denominated intercompany loans and eliminated foreign exchange variability since the notional amounts of the swaps equaled that of the loans  and all cash flow dates and interest rates coincided between the swaps and the loans  therefore no ineffectiveness was expected 
these swaps had been designated as cash flow hedges 
in november  the five year cross currency swaps were de designated as cash flow hedges  due to our decision to execute new off setting cross currency swaps two year cross currency swaps to lock in the euro forward exchange rate for the principal exchange on the five year cross currency swaps that were due on october  the two year swaps were not designated as cash flow hedges  therefore all changes in fair value were reported in interest expense  net  and other expense income  net 
the two and five year swaps were settled on october  in september  we de designated our ten year swaps as hedging instruments due to the early settlement of a portion of these swaps by one of our counterparties effective october  as a result of this termination  we executed a new cross currency swap effective october  to maintain the total notional amount of the ten year swaps at we concurrently designated all the ten year swaps as a net investment hedge of the value of one of our us subsidiaries net investment in our belgium based subsidiary  cytec surface specialties sa nv  against the risk of adverse foreign exchange movements in the usd value of the euro 
since the critical terms of the ten year swaps match the critical terms of the net investment in cytec surface specialties sa nv  the ten year swaps are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the value of the net investment attributable to the changes in usd value of the euro 
all cross currency swaps are recorded at fair value as either assets or liabilities 
each period we record the change in the fair value of the ten year swaps in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the ten year swaps  prior to de designation as cash flow 
table of contents hedges in september  we reclassified an amount out of accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement to offset the foreign currency gain or loss on the remeasurement to usd of the euro intercompany loans 
the amount of such reclassification depended on changes in the usd euro exchange rate that occurred during the period 
we also accounted for the five year swaps in this manner until de designation as cash flow hedges in november for cross currency swaps designated as a hedge of our net investment in cytec surface specialties sa nv  the fair value is calculated each period with changes in fair value reported in foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
such amounts reclassified to a translation adjustment will remain in other comprehensive income loss until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in cytec surface specialties sa nv 
the fair values of the two year swaps and  since its de designation  the five year swaps  were calculated each period with changes in fair value reported in interest expense  net  and other expense income  net 
we monitor the counterparty credit risk and  while designated as cash flow hedges  the continued probability of the hedged cash flows as to amount and timing 
cash flow hedges in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a contract for the construction of certain manufacturing equipment  the payments for which are denominated in swiss francs chf  and will total approximately chf 
these chf payments expose us to exchange rate fluctuations between chf and usd 
to hedge this risk  we entered into forward contracts to buy chf and sell usd at agreed upon rates 
to protect our consolidated earnings against the risk of foreign currency related fluctuation associated with the forecasted chf payments for the equipment  we designated the currency forward to buy chf and sell usd on the forward s maturity date the hedging instrument as a cash flow hedge of the foreign currency risks associated with our capitalization of the first  previously unhedged  forecasted chf denominated invoices 
at hedge inception  we expected that the hedging relationship would be highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged because the key features and terms ie  the currency  notional amount  and timing for the forward and the respective hedged transactions closely match at inception 
if the hedging relationship qualifies as highly effective  the hedging instrument will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and accumulated other comprehensive income will be adjusted to a balance that reflects the lesser of either the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument or the cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative 
the amount of ineffectiveness  if any  recorded in earnings will be equal to the excess of the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument over the cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative 
amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 
each hedging relationship will terminate once the payable related to the hedged transactions as defined above is recognized and the hedging instrument or portion thereof equal to each hedged transaction will be marked to market through current period earnings in future periods after termination of the hedging relationship providing offset against the remeasurement through earnings of the chf denominated payable 
as of december   the notional amount of the forward contracts designated as a cash flow hedge is approximately  and the unrealized loss as of december  is approximately the contracts will settle in the first and third quarters of there was no hedge ineffectiveness for the contracts in commodity price risk at times  we used natural gas forwards to hedge a portion of our utility requirements at certain of our north american manufacturing facilities 
these forward contracts  which were highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows of the underlying natural gas purchases  had been designated as cash flow hedges and were reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value  with the effective portion of the hedged item included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on an after tax basis 
gains and losses were reclassified into earnings  as a component of manufacturing cost of sales  in the period the hedged natural gas purchases affected earnings 
if the derivative was no longer highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows  subsequent changes in fair value were recorded in other income expense  net 
any ineffectiveness was recognized in other income expense  net in the current period 
if the hedging relationship was terminated  we continued to defer the related gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income and included it as a component of the cost of the underlying hedged item 
if the forecasted transaction was no longer likely to occur  we recognized the related gain or loss in other income expense  net in that period 
we did not terminate 
table of contents any hedges during   and all hedged transactions that were forecasted to occur in   and occurred as forecasted 
ineffectiveness during these years was insignificant 
there are no natural gas hedges outstanding as of december  fair value measurements we have certain assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements  for which we determine the appropriate level in the fair value input hierarchy for each fair value measurement 
the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs  which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  into three levels 
it gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  interest rates  exchange rates  and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
all of our derivatives are valued based on level inputs 
our currency forwards are valued based on readily available published indices for currency exchange rates 
our cross currency swaps are valued using an income approach based on industry standard techniques 
this model includes a discounted cash flow analysis that nets the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments resulting from the swap 
the analysis is based on the contractual terms of the swaps including the period to maturity and observable market based inputs that include time value  interest rate curves  foreign exchange rates  implied volatilities  as well as other relevant economic measures 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level inputs  such as estimates of current credit spreads  to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties 
however  as of december   we have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives 
as a result  we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
at december   the unfavorable fair value of the ten year swaps was the following table summarizes the approximate impact that a change in certain critical inputs would have on the fair values of our ten year swaps 
the approximate impact of the change in each critical input assumes all other inputs and factors remain constant
