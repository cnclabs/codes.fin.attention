overview our company we are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading apparel brands  including hanes  champion  bali  playtex  just my size  l eggs  barely there  wonderbra  gear for sports  stedman  zorba  rinbros  sol y oro  outer banks and duofold 
we design  manufacture  source and sell a broad range of basic apparel such as t shirts  bras  panties  men s underwear  kids underwear  casualwear  activewear  socks and hosiery 
according to npd  our brands held either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete  for the month period ended november  our segments our operations are managed and reported in five operating segments  each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes innerwear  outerwear  hosiery  direct to consumer and international 
these segments are organized principally by product category  geographic location and distribution channel 
each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations of the segment s businesses but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms 
certain prior year segment operating profit disclosures have been revised to conform to the current year presentation 
these changes were primarily the result of our decision to cease allocating certain compensation related expenses to the segments 

table of contents the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are as follows innerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of women s intimate apparel  men s underwear  kids underwear and socks 
outerwear sells basic branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature under the product categories of casualwear and activewear to both retailers and wholesalers  as well as licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores and other channels 
hosiery sells products in categories such as pantyhose  knee highs and tights 
direct to consumer includes our value based outlet stores and internet operations which sell products from our portfolio of leading brands 
our internet operations are supported by its catalogs 
international primarily relates to the latin america  asia  canada  europe and australia geographic locations which sell products that span across the innerwear  outerwear and hosiery reportable segments 
outlook for we continue to operate in an uncertain and volatile economic environment  which has impacted our business in and will continue to do so in after a strong performance in with sales growth of  we expect modest sales growth in of to with projected net sales of billion to billion compared to billion in the primary drivers of the projected net sales growth are expected to be shelf space gains and net price increases in our innerwear segment and double digit shelf space gains in our international segment 
these sales gains are expected to be partially offset by sales declines in our outerwear segment due to lower sales in both our retail and wholesale casualwear categories partially offset by continued sales growth in our activewear category 
the growth in our activewear category is expected to come from new programs at major sporting goods retailers as well as expansion of our c by champion brand at target 
the expected net sales decline in the wholesale casualwear imagewear category is the result of structural challenges within this market relating to higher cotton costs and the hyper competitive pricing environment 
we are focused on delivering profitable growth and remain highly committed to strong cash flow generation and utilizing that cash flow to de leverage and pay down debt as the year unfolds 
through expected improvements in working capital  primarily from reduction in inventory levels as a result of declining cotton costs  and operating results  we expect to generate approximately million to million in operating cash flows in we expect to use these cash flows primarily for debt reduction 

table of contents business and industry trends inflation and changing prices the economic environment in which we are operating continues to be uncertain and volatile  which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business during and beyond 
we have seen a sustained increase in various input costs  such as cotton and oil related materials  utilities  freight and wages  which have impacted our results in and will continue to do so through at least the first half of based on current market conditions  we expect the estimated impact of cost inflation could be in the range of million to million higher in over  of which approximately million relates to higher cotton costs 
the cost inflation will primarily impact the first two quarters of rising demand for cotton resulting from the economic recovery  weather related supply disruptions  significant declines in us inventory and a sharp rise in the futures market for cotton caused cotton prices to surge upward during and while cotton prices have declined in recent months  we will continue to have higher prices for cotton and oil related materials reflected in our cost of sales  which will continue to impact our results through at least the first half of cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products 
while we have sold our yarn operations  we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton 
during  cotton prices hit their highest levels in years  although they declined some in the second half of and into increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large scale yarn suppliers and may result in the need to implement future price increases in order to maintain our margins 
decreases in cotton prices can lead to lower margins for inventory and products produced from cotton we have already purchased  particularly if there is downward price pressure as a result of consumer demand  competition or other factors 
price increases during  including those implemented in response to higher prices for cotton and other raw materials  contributed favorably to net sales growth and positively affected margins 
our costs for cotton yarn and cotton based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton  which is affected by  among other factors  weather  consumer demand  speculation on the commodities market  the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control 
we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton 
under our agreements with these suppliers  we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases 
when we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements  interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn 
the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers 
however  our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices 
although the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us has historically represented only approximately of our cost of sales  it rose to around in primarily as a result of cost inflation 
costs incurred today for materials and labor  including cotton  typically do not impact our results as the inventory is sold approximately six to nine months later 
inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins 
for example  the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process  such as oil related commodities and other raw materials  such as dyes and chemicals  and other costs  such as fuel  energy and utility costs  can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors 
costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold 
in addition  a significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the united states and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs 
increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in consumer income  which also could have a negative impact on spending 
other business and industry trends the basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly 
competition is generally based upon brand name recognition  price  product quality  selection  service and purchasing convenience 
the majority of our core styles continue from year to year  with variations only in color  fabric or design details 
some products  however  such as intimate apparel  activewear and sheer hosiery  do have more of an emphasis on style and innovation 
our businesses face competition from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers  as well as smaller companies  department stores  specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands 

table of contents our top customers accounted for of our net sales 
our largest customers in were wal mart  target and kohl s  which accounted for  and of total sales  respectively 
the growth in retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek to have greater concessions in their purchase of our products  while they can be increasingly demanding that we provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis 
to counteract these effects  it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in today s challenging economic environment 
in addition  during the past several years  various retailers  including some of our largest customers  have experienced significant difficulties  including restructurings  bankruptcies and liquidations  and the ability of retailers to overcome these difficulties may increase due to worldwide economic conditions 
brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and project required quality and value 
anticipating changes in and managing our operations in response to consumer preferences remains an important element of our business 
in recent years  we have experienced changes in our net sales and cash flows in accordance with changes in consumer preferences and trends 
for example  we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry and with shifts in consumer preferences 
the hosiery segment only comprised of our net sales in however  and as a result  the decline in the hosiery segment has not had a significant impact on our net sales  revenues or cash flows 
generally  we manage the hosiery segment for cash  placing an emphasis on reducing our cost structure and managing cash efficiently 
our key business strategies our key business strategies are focused on optimizing our strong brands to drive modest sales growth domestically and internationally  using our low cost global supply chain and implementing cost savings initiatives to expand margins  and delivering strong cash flow to create value 
we seek to drive modest sales growth by consistently offering consumers brands they trust and products with unsurpassed value 
our brands have a strong heritage in the basic apparel industry 
according to npd  our brands held either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete  for the month period ended november  internationally  our commercial markets include mexico  canada  japan  india  brazil and china  where a substantial amount of gross domestic product growth outside the united states will be concentrated over the next decade 
our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success 
our design  research and product development teams  in partnership with our marketing teams  drive our efforts to bring innovations to market 
we seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the basic apparel industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing  addressing changing customer needs and industry trends 
we also support our key brands with targeted  effective advertising and marketing campaigns 
we seek to expand margins through optimizing our low cost global supply chain and streamlining our operations to reduce costs 
we believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies  purchasing power and product design  marketing and customer management resources than our smaller competitors 
our global supply chain spans across both the western and eastern hemispheres and provides us with a balanced approach to product supply  which relies on a combination of owned  contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions  increases the efficiency of our operations  reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply 
our global supply chain enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres  thereby diversifying our production risks 
we have generated significant cost savings  margin expansion and contributions to cash flow and will continue to do so as we further optimize our size  scale and production capability 
for example  we commenced production at our textile production plant in nanjing  china  which is our first company owned textile facility in asia  in the fourth quarter of and we ramped up production over time and are now at full capacity 
the nanjing facility  along with our other textile facilities and arrangements with outside contractors  enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres to support our production capacity 

table of contents we seek to effectively generate strong cash flow through optimizing our capital structure and managing working capital levels 
our strong cash flows have resulted in a flexible long term capital structure that is able to deliver shareholder value in numerous ways  including debt reduction and our ability to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions 
in addition  we intend to improve turns for inventory which will also contribute to strong cash flows in seasonality and other factors our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors 
generally  our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items 
we generally have higher sales during back to school shopping and holiday selling seasons and during periods of cooler weather  which benefits certain product categories such as fleece 
sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand 
our customers may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us 
media  advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions 
although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned  rather than on an impulse  basis  our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers 
discretionary spending is affected by many factors  including  among others  general business conditions  interest rates  inflation  consumer debt levels  the availability of consumer credit  currency exchange rates  taxation  electricity power rates  gasoline prices  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
many of these factors are outside our control 
consumers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  could decline during periods when disposable income is lower  when prices increase in response to rising costs  or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
these consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lower priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products  or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time 
changes in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher margin products  such as intimate apparel and male underwear  and lower margin products  such as casualwear and activewear  as well as the amount attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same product category  fluctuate from time to time 
our customers may change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us  which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict 
however  certain changes in product sales mix are seasonal in nature  as sales of socks  hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during the last two quarters july to december of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather  back to school shopping and holidays  while other changes in product mix may be attributable to customers preferences and discretionary spending 
components of net sales and expenses net sales we generate net sales by selling basic apparel products such as t shirts  bras  panties  men s underwear  kids underwear  socks  hosiery  casualwear and activewear 
our net sales are recognized net of discounts  coupons  rebates  volume based incentives and cooperative advertising costs

cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing finished goods  which consists of labor  raw materials such as cotton and petroleum based products and overhead costs such as depreciation on owned facilities and equipment 
our cost of sales also includes finished goods sourced from third party manufacturers that supply us with products 
table of contents based on our designs as well as charges for slow moving or obsolete inventories 
rebates  discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold 
our costs of sales do not include shipping costs  comprised of payments to third party shippers  or handling costs  comprised of warehousing costs in our distribution facilities  and thus our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities that include such costs in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses include selling  advertising  costs of shipping  handling and distribution to our customers  research and development  rent on leased facilities  depreciation on owned facilities and equipment and other general and administrative expenses

restructuring we have from time to time closed facilities and reduced headcount  including in connection with previously announced restructuring and business transformation plans 
we refer to these activities as restructuring actions 
when we decide to close facilities or reduce headcount  we take estimated charges for such restructuring  including charges for exited non cancelable leases and other contractual obligations  as well as severance and benefits 
if the actual charge is different from the original estimate  an adjustment is recognized in the period such change in estimate is identified 
other expenses other expenses include charges such as losses on early extinguishment of debt  costs to amend and restate our credit facilities  fees associated with sales of certain trade accounts receivable to financial institutions  and charges related to the termination of certain interest rate hedging arrangements

interest income is the return we earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate fluctuates from period to period and can be materially impacted by  among other things changes in the mix of our earnings from the various jurisdictions in which we operate  the tax characteristics of our earnings  the timing and amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we repatriate to the united states  which may increase our tax expense and taxes paid  and the timing and results of any reviews of our income tax filing positions in the jurisdictions in which we transact business

table of contents liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and availability under our revolving loan facility  accounts receivable securitization facility and international loan facilities 
at december   we had million of borrowing availability under our million revolving loan facility after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  million of short term borrowing availability under our international loan facilities and million in cash and cash equivalents 
we currently believe that our existing cash balances and cash generated by operations  together with our available credit capacity  will enable us to comply with the terms of our indebtedness and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements 
the following have impacted or are expected to impact liquidity we have principal and interest obligations under our debt  we expect to continue to invest in efforts to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs  we may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions  we could increase or decrease the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states  which could significantly impact our effective income tax rate  and our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our stock in the open market million of which we have repurchased as of december  at a cost of million  although we may choose not to repurchase any stock and instead focus on other uses of cash such as the repayment of our debt 
we expect to be able to manage our working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
factors that could help us in these efforts include higher sales volume and the realization of additional cost benefits from previous restructuring and related actions 
the economic environment in which we are operating continues to be uncertain and volatile  which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business during and beyond 
we have seen a sustained increase in various input costs  such as cotton and oil related materials  utilities  freight and wages  which have impacted our results in and will continue to do so through at least the first half of during  we experienced substantial pressure on profitability due to the economic climate  such as higher cotton  energy and labor costs 
rising demand for cotton resulting from the economic recovery  weather related supply disruptions  significant declines in us inventory and a sharp rise in the futures market for cotton caused cotton prices to surge upward during and early because of systemic cost inflation in  particularly for cotton  energy and labor  we implemented price increases during the timing  magnitude and frequency of price increases varied by product category  channel of trade  and country  with some increases occurring as frequently as quarterly 
while cotton prices have declined in recent months  we will continue to have higher prices for cotton and oil related materials reflected in our cost of sales  which will continue to impact our results through at least the first half of based on current market conditions  we expect the estimated impact of inflation could be in the range of million to million higher in over  of which approximately million relates to higher cotton costs 
we expect the cost inflation will primarily impact the first two quarters of the three price increases we implemented between february and october in will help mitigate the inflation 
looking forward  cotton prices have moderated and appear to have settled at levels considerably lower than record prices 
we have been working with our retail partners on appropriate pricing strategies to implement when lower cotton prices work through our supply chain 
the profitability of outerwear s wholesale casualwear category is being adversely affected by hypercompetitive pricing in the wholesale screen print market 
we expect pricing in this market s basic product promotional sector to continue to remain problematic  and in response we will de emphasize the promotional basic sector while maintaining our presence in the more profitable premium product and core product sectors where we have a stronger position 
due to lower unit volumes from price elasticity and the impact of wholesale casualwear category issues described above  we are adjusting manufacturing capacity  primarily by taking time in our facilities as well as eliminating certain contractors 
we expect to incur approximately million in charges related to these proposed actions  which will primarily impact the first quarter of these charges will be offset by efficiency savings of approximately million to million we expect to realize from our supply chain optimization initiatives in the hosiery category has been in a state of consistent decline for the past decade  as the trend toward casual dress reduced demand for sheer hosiery 
the hosiery segment comprised only of our net sales in  however  and as a result  the decline in the hosiery segment has not had a significant impact on our net sales or cash flows 
generally  we manage the hosiery segment for cash  placing an emphasis on reducing our cost structure and managing cash efficiently 
cash requirements for our business we rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our revolving loan facility  accounts receivable securitization facility and international loan facilities to meet the cash requirements of our business 
the primary cash requirements of our business are payments to vendors in the normal course of business  capital expenditures  maturities of debt and related interest payments  contributions to our pension plans and repurchases of our stock 
we believe we have sufficient cash and available borrowings for our liquidity needs 

table of contents our working capital increased during  primarily in the form of inventory  as a result of cost inflation 
in  we expect working capital to be lower due to lower inventory levels as a result of the sale of inventory containing higher input costs and a reduction in inventory unit levels 
capital spending has varied significantly from year to year as we built and seek to optimize our global supply chain in an effort to streamline our operations and reduce costs 
we spent million on gross capital expenditures during  which were offset by cash proceeds of million primarily from a sale leaseback transaction 
during  we expect net capital expenditures of approximately million to continue to support our infrastructure 
pension plans under the pension protection act funding rules  our us qualified pension plan is approximately funded as of december  compared to funded as of january  the funded status reflects an increase in the benefit obligation due to a decrease in the discount rate used in the valuation of the liability and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets as a result of the stock market s performance during we expect to make required cash contributions of approximately million to the us qualified pension plan in based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary 
we expect pension expense in of approximately million compared to million in see note to our financial statements for more information on the plan asset and pension expense components 
in june  the us congress passed legislation that provides for pension funding relief for companies with defined benefit pension plans by allowing those companies to choose between two alternative funding schedules amortizing funding shortfalls over years for any two plan years between and  or paying interest on a funding shortfall for only two plan years of the employer s choosing after which a seven year amortization would apply

in february  we amended the senior secured credit facility  which includes the revolving loan facility  to reflect improved debt ratings 
this amendment reduced the interest rate  extended the maturity date by two years to december   and increased the flexibility of debt covenants and the use of excess cash flow 
in addition  the commitment fee for the unused portion of revolving loan commitments was reduced from basis points to basis points 
further  the applicable margin pricing grid for the loans  which varies based on our leverage ratio as defined below  was reduced by basis points at each applicable leverage ratio level 
pursuant to this amendment  the ratio of total debt to ebitda the leverage ratio that we may not exceed was increased from to for each fiscal quarter ending between october  and april  to to  and will decline over time to to also  the minimum ratio of ebitda to consolidated total interest expense that we are required to maintain was decreased from to for each fiscal quarter ending between july  and october  to to and will increase over time to to in addition  we will be required to maintain a maximum ratio of senior secured indebtedness to ebitda  which for each fiscal quarter ending between october  and october  cannot exceed to and will decline over time to to the methods of calculating all of the components used in these ratios are included in the senior secured credit facility 
this amendment also significantly increased the flexibility of the indebtedness  investment and restricted payments baskets and use of excess cash flow under the senior secured credit facility

table of contents accounts receivable securitization the accounts receivable securitization facility provides for up to million in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing  limited to the availability of eligible receivables  and is secured by certain domestic trade receivables 
under the terms of the accounts receivable securitization facility  we and certain of our subsidiaries sell  on a revolving basis  certain domestic trade receivables to hbi receivables llc receivables llc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary that in turn uses the trade receivables to secure the borrowings  which are funded through conduits that issue commercial paper in the short term market and are not affiliated with us or through committed bank purchasers if the conduits fail to fund 
the assets and liabilities of receivables llc are fully reflected on the consolidated balance sheet  and the securitization is treated as a secured borrowing for accounting purposes 
the borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility remain outstanding throughout the term of the agreement subject to us maintaining sufficient eligible receivables  by continuing to sell trade receivables to receivables llc  unless an event of default occurs 
the accounts receivable securitization facility will terminate on march   however  we plan to extend the term 
availability of funding under the accounts receivable securitization facility depends primarily upon the eligible outstanding receivables balance 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility 
the outstanding balance under the accounts receivable securitization facility is reported on the consolidated balance sheet in the line accounts receivable securitization facility 
unless the conduits fail to fund  the yield on the commercial paper  which is the conduits cost to issue the commercial paper plus certain dealer fees  is considered a financing cost and is included in interest expense on the consolidated statement of income

as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
notes payable notes payable were million at december  and million at january  at december   we had million of borrowing availability under our international loan facilities 
we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in each of the international loan facilities at december  undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries as of december   the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately billion  of which less than million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested  and million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are not considered permanently reinvested 
our intention is to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings we have previously asserted as being permanently reinvested in our international operations 
we reassess our reinvestment assertions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient other sources of liquidity to support our assertion that such undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently 

table of contents we repatriated million  million and million in  and  respectively  from earnings generated in such years 
the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated in the past has been determined  and the amount that we expect to repatriate during will be determined  based upon a variety of factors including current year earnings of the foreign subsidiaries  foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the us  such as for the repayment of debt and other domestic obligations 
the majority of our repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries has historically occurred at year end  although we may always repatriate funds earlier in the year based on the needs of our business 
when we repatriate funds to the us  we are required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates  net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against us income tax 
we paid million  million and million in additional us federal income taxes in  and  respectively  as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in such years 
we do not currently expect the amount of repatriated foreign earnings or the resulting additional tax expense in to differ materially from prior fiscal years 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  titled summary of significant accounting policies  to our financial statements 
the application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation 
if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements  or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors  are described below sales recognition and incentives we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the sales price is fixed or determinable  iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  which occurs primarily upon shipment 
we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience 
note d  titled summary of significant accounting policies sales recognition and incentives  to our financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products 
measuring the cost of these incentives requires  in many cases  estimating future customer utilization and redemption rates 
we use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information 
we classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated statements of income 
accounts receivable valuation accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers 
we carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider a combination of factors  such as the aging of trade receivables  industry trends  and our customers financial strength  credit standing  and payment and default history 
changes in the aforementioned factors  among others  may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the selling  general and administrative expenses line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the net sales line of our consolidated statements of income 
our management reviews these 
table of contents estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a large reserve might be required 
the amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts 
inventory valuation we carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out  or fifo  method for our inventories 
we carry obsolete  damaged  and excess inventory at the net realizable value  which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates  current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans 
because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time  there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination 
market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change  resulting in further reserve requirements 
a reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period 
while we believe that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the financial statements  consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
rebates  discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item  and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold 
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recorded deferred taxes related to operating losses 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions  the amount and timing of which are uncertain  possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies 
if in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to offset losses during the carryforward periods  we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized 
an adjustment to income tax expense would be required in a future period if we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount 
federal income taxes are provided on that portion of our income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states and be taxable  reflecting the decisions made by us with regards to earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
decisions we make as to the amount of earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions  due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements  may impact our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate 
we periodically estimate the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and our informed judgment 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to  or further interpretations of  regulations 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these events occur  and these adjustments are included in our consolidated statements of income 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that our effective tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
a company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
in conjunction with the spin off  we and sara lee entered into a tax sharing agreement  which allocates responsibilities between us and sara lee for taxes and certain other tax matters 
under the tax sharing agreement  sara lee generally is liable for all us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods ending on or before september  sara lee also is liable for income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods beginning before september  and ending after september   but only to the extent those taxes are allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on september  we are generally liable for all other taxes attributable to us 
changes in the amounts payable or receivable by us under the stipulations of this agreement may impact our tax provision in any period 

table of contents as previously disclosed  we disagreed with sara lee as to the amount of deferred taxes that should have been attributable to our united states and canadian operations on our opening balance sheet as of september  following our spin off from sara lee 
the computation of this amount is governed by a tax sharing agreement entered into in connection with the spin off 
we have had differing interpretations of the tax sharing agreement from sara lee  and  in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of the agreement  we along with sara lee submitted that dispute to arbitration before a three member tribunal in august a hearing was held in august based on our computation of the final amount of deferred taxes for our opening balance sheet as of september   the amount that we expected to collect from sara lee based on our computation of million  which reflects a preliminary cash installment received from sara lee of million  was included as a receivable in other current assets 
on july   the tribunal issued a decision in which the majority disagreed with our interpretation of the tax sharing agreement and awarded us million  plus interest based on the majority s interpretation of the tax sharing agreement 
this amount reflects other payments made or acknowledged to be owed by the parties under the tax sharing agreement 
as a result of the tribunal s decision  during the second quarter of we recorded a non cash transaction that reduced other current assets and additional paid in capital by million 
stock compensation we established the hanesbrands inc omnibus incentive plan of the omnibus incentive plan to award stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  restricted stock units  deferred stock units  performance shares and cash to our employees  non employee directors and employees of our subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and retention of employees 
stock based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
estimation of stock based compensation for stock options granted  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model  requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility and expected option life 
we use a combination of the volatility of our company and the volatility of peer companies for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions 
we utilize the simplified method outlined in sec accounting rules to estimate expected lives for options granted 
the simplified method is used for valuing stock option grants by eligible public companies that do not have sufficient historical exercise patterns on options granted to employees 
we estimate forfeitures for stock based awards granted that are not expected to vest 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
defined benefit pension plans for a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost  plan obligations  plan assets  and how we measure the amount of these costs  see note titled defined benefit pension plans to our consolidated financial statements 
under the pension protection act funding rules  our us qualified pension plan is approximately funded as of december  compared to funded as of january  the funded status reflects an increase in the benefit obligation due to a decrease in the discount rate used in the valuation of the liability  and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets as a result of the stock market s performance during in june  the us congress passed legislation that provides for pension funding relief for companies with defined benefit pension plans by allowing those companies to choose between two alternative funding schedules amortizing funding shortfalls over years for any two plan years between and  or paying interest on a funding shortfall for only two plan years of the employer s choosing after which a seven year amortization would apply 
in december  we elected the alternative amortization schedule for the plan year  which will benefit us with improved cash flow starting in due to expected lower pension contributions  however total cash flow over the course of the next several years will remain the same 
we expect to make required cash contributions of approximately million to the us qualified pension plan in based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary 
we expect pension expense in of approximately million compared to million in see note to our financial statements for more information on the plan asset components 
the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized on our balance sheet and changes in the funded status are reflected in comprehensive income 
we measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year end 

table of contents the net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long term rate of asset return 
the net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred 
gains and losses  which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions  are amortized over the average future expected life of participants 
our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows in determining the discount rate  we utilized the citigroup pension discount curve rounded to the nearest basis points in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan 
salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
the salary increase assumption only applies to the canadian plans and portions of the hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans  as benefits under these plans are not frozen 
the benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan were frozen as of december  in determining the long term rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical long term compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments  and the utilization of forward looking assumptions 
retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality 
the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans benefit obligations  all other factors being equal  is illustrated by the following increase decrease in in millions pension expense benefit obligation decrease in discount rate increase in discount rate decrease in expected investment return n a increase in expected investment return n a trademarks and other identifiable intangibles trademarks  license agreements  customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives  and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives 
we base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors  including the effects of demand  competition  expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows 
as of december   the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was million  of which we are amortizing the entire balance 
we anticipate that our amortization expense for will be million 
we evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
in order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization  we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount 
we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 

table of contents we measure a trademark s fair value using the royalty saved method 
we determine the royalty saved method by evaluating various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans  and present value techniques 
the rates we use to discount cash flows are based on interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time 
because there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them  the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
goodwill as of december   we had million of goodwill 
we do not amortize goodwill  but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter 
the estimated fair values significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter  and no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in the impairment test we performed in required us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  primarily using discounted cash flow methodologies based on projected revenues and cash flows that will be derived from a reporting unit 
beginning with our goodwill impairment test in  as a result of new accounting rules issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb  we will be permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the two step impairment test prescribed under current accounting rules 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
intangible assets that are being amortized must be tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value might not be recoverable 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill in  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units 
we relied on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans  and present value techniques 
as discussed above under trademarks and other identifiable intangibles  there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors  and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at its historical cost  and we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the asset s life 
we estimate an asset s life based on historical experience  manufacturers estimates  engineering or appraisal evaluations  our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us  which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life 
our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization 
a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods 
based upon current levels of depreciation  the average remaining depreciable life of our net property other than land is five years 
we test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in business climate  several periods of operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
we evaluate an asset s recoverability by comparing the asset or asset group s net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate 
if we determine that an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
when we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use  we depreciate the asset s adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life 
we do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances change 

table of contents insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for property  workers compensation and other casualty programs 
we are responsible for losses up to certain limits and are required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits 
this liability is based on management s estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical trends  actuarial assumptions and economic conditions 
if actual trends differ from the estimates  the financial results could be impacted 
actual trends have not differed materially from the estimates 
assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method  which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
we recognize the excess of an acquired business s cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill 
we use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we generally use third party appraisers to determine the fair value and lives of property and identifiable intangibles  consulting actuaries to assist us in determining the fair value of obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans  and legal counsel to assess obligations associated with legal and environmental claims 
recently issued accounting pronouncements fair value measurements in may  the fasb issued new accounting rules related to fair value measurements 
the new accounting rules clarify some existing concepts  eliminate wording differences between accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs  and in some limited cases  change some principles to achieve convergence between gaap and ifrs 
the new accounting rules result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between gaap and ifrs 
the new accounting rules also expand the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs

foreign exchange risk we sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars  however  we purchase some raw materials  pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  european euro  mexican peso and japanese yen against the us dollar 
we use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange currencies will have on our forward and option contracts 
at december   the potential change in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments  assuming a adverse change in the underlying currency price  was million 
interest rates our debt under the revolving loan facility  floating rate senior notes and accounts receivable securitization facility bears interest at variable rates 
as a result  we are exposed to changes in market interest rates that could impact the cost of servicing our debt 
we are required under the senior secured credit facility to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate debt issuance 
we are in compliance with this provision as a result of our senior notes and senior notes which bear interest at fixed rates 
approximately of our total debt outstanding at december  is at a fixed rate 
after giving effect to these arrangements  a basis point movement in the annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of december  would result in a change in annual interest expense of million 
we may execute interest rate cash flow hedges in the form of caps and swaps in the future in order to mitigate our exposure to variability in cash flows for the future interest payments on a designated portion of borrowings 
commodities cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products 
while we have sold our yarn operations  we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton 
during  cotton prices hit their highest levels in years 
increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large scale yarn suppliers  while decreases in cotton prices can result in inventory comprised of products made from higher cost yarn and in our purchase of cotton at contractually fixed prices that are above the current market rate 
our costs for cotton yarn and cotton based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton  which is affected by  among other things  weather  consumer demand  speculation on the commodities market  the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control 
we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton 
under our agreements with these suppliers  we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases 
when we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements  interim fluctuations 
table of contents in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn 
the yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers 
however  our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices 
although the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us has historically represented only of our cost of sales  it has risen to around primarily as a result of cost inflation 
the cotton prices reflected in our results were per pound in and cents per pound in costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold 
for example  we estimate that an increase of per pound in cotton prices at current levels of production would affect our annual cost of sales by million related to finished goods manufactured internally in our manufacturing facilities and million related to finished goods sourced by third parties 
the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified  as the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling prices are uncertain  but any dramatic increase in the price of cotton would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
additionally  significant decreases in the price of cotton may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production  which could result in lower gross margins  particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure 
in addition  fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture our products  such as chemicals  dyestuffs  polyester yarn and foam 
we generally purchase raw materials at market prices 
we estimate that a change of per barrel in the price of oil would affect our freight costs by approximately million  at current levels of usage
