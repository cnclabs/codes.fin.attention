item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
prior to  golden star reported to security regulators in canada  ghana and the us using financial statements prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles canadian gaap with a footnote reconciliation showing financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
however  a change in sec position in late required canadian companies such as golden star  which do not qualify as foreign private issuers  to file their financial statements in the us using us gaap after december  we therefore adopted us gaap as of january  for all of our subsequent us  ghanaian and canadian filings 
all comparative financial information presented in this form k is reported in accordance with us gaap 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes information available to february  non gaap financial measures in this form k  we use the terms total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce 
cost of sales as found in our statements of operations  includes all mine site operating costs  including the costs of mining  ore processing  maintenance  work in process inventory changes  mine site overhead as well as production taxes  royalties  mine site depreciation  depletion  amortization  asset retirement obligation accretion and by product credits  but excludes exploration costs  property holding costs  corporate office general and administrative expenses  impairment charges  corporate business development costs  gains and losses on asset sales  foreign exchange gains and losses  interest expense  gains and losses on derivatives  gains and losses on investments and income tax expense benefit 
cash operating cost per ounce for a period is equal to cost of sales for the period less mining related depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  royalties  production taxes  accretion of asset retirement obligation costs  costs that meet the definition of betterment stripping and operations related foreign currency gains and losses for the period  divided by the number of ounces of gold sold during the period 
total cash cost per ounce for a period is equal to cash operating costs for the period plus royalties and production taxes  divided by the number of ounces of gold sold during the period

we monitor these measures monthly  comparing each month s values to prior periods values to detect trends that may indicate increases or decreases in operating efficiencies 
these measures are also compared against budget to alert management of trends that may cause actual results to deviate from planned operational results 
we provide these measures to our investors to allow them to also monitor operational efficiencies of our mines 
we calculate these measures for both individual operating units and on a consolidated basis 
total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce should be considered as non gaap financial measures as defined in sec regulation s k item and in applicable canadian securities laws and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
there are material limitations associated with the use of such non gaap measures 
since these measures do not incorporate revenues  changes in working capital and non operating cash costs  they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap 
changes in numerous factors including  but not limited to  mining rates  processing rates  ore grade  gold recovery  costs of labor  consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease 
we believe that these measures are similar to the measures of other gold mining companies  but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance 
trends and events in the twelve months ended december  gold prices while gold prices have generally trended upward during the last ten years from a low of per ounce in to a high of  per ounce in september  gold prices can fluctuate widely due to several factors such as changes in demand for physical gold  forward selling by gold mining companies  government actions  changes in the value of the us dollar and global mine production rates 
we realized  per ounce for our gold shipments during the fourth quarter of and  per ounce for the full year of adoption of us gaap in prior to  golden star had since its inception  reported to security regulators in both canada and the us using canadian gaap financial statements with a footnote reconciliation to us gaap 
however  a change in sec position in late required that canadian companies such as golden star  which do not qualify as foreign private issuers  must file their financial statements in the us using us gaap beginning in in response  we adopted us gaap as of january   for all subsequent reporting in the us  canada  and ghana 
increases in mining costs while gold prices have trended sharply upward in recent years  the industry has also experienced steady increases in mine operating costs including the costs of fuel  electric power  labor  explosives  mining equipment  equipment maintenance parts and chemicals consumed in the processing plants 
in addition  many governments around the world have increased mineral royalties  fees and income tax rates in recent years 
mining is an energy intensive industry using significant quantities of electricity and fuel in the mining  transport  crushing  grinding and processing of ores and as a result  a mine s cost structure is sensitive to changes in fuel and electric power costs 
increases in crude oil prices from per barrel in early  to in excess of per barrel in late have thus contributed to higher mining costs worldwide 
increasing fuel costs have also resulted in higher electric power in many areas including ghana 
the resource boom of recent years has constrained availability of skilled mining personnel  which in turn has put upward pressure on labor costs 
it has also contributed to increases in mining equipment costs and long lead times for new orders 
an analysis of cash operating costs of competitors mines in africa  north america  and south america as reported in their public financial reporting documents  show that on average  cash operating costs in the first nine months of were up over the first nine months of while these various companies may apply differing cost accounting procedures  this analysis is an indication of recent trends in gold mining costs 
increases in taxation and royalties during  several countries announced increases  or intent to increase mineral royalty rates  income tax rates and fees applicable to mining operations  including australia  peru  bolivia  chile  tanzania  ecuador  mali  brazil  burkina faso and ghana 
in early  ghana raised its royalty rates on gold mines from to  and which was a major factor in the increase in the royalties paid by our mines in  as compared to in late  the government of ghana proposed a number of changes to the mining fiscal regime for  which if implemented  will likely result in an increase in corporate tax payable by mining companies in ghana 
the government of ghana has indicated that in the corporate income tax rate will increase from to for mining companies  and capital allowances tax depreciation will be deductible at a flat rate of over a five year period instead of an deduction in the year that the capital spending was incurred 
in addition  the government proposed to disallow expenditures from one mining area as a deduction from revenues in a separate mining area belonging to the same company in determining the company s taxable income 
the government also announced its intent to introduce a windfall profit tax on mining companies in the details of these tax changes have not been made available and we are thus not able to determine the impact of these new taxes on our operations at this time 
moreover  the ghana government announced in late that it intends to establish a tax stability renegotiation team which plans to review the existing tax stability agreements of mining companies operating in ghana 
while our mines do not have tax stability agreements  it is not clear at this time if the tax stability renegotiation team will review out deeds of warranty which specify certain tax agreements for our properties 
convertible debt our million convertible debentures mature on november  we have the option to settle this liability in cash payment  or subject to certain limitations  in common shares 
see the liquidity outlook section below for additional details of the settlement alternatives for this debt 
results of operations compared to consolidated results consolidated financial results include a net loss attributable to golden star of million or per share which was improved over a net loss attributable to golden star of million or per share in while the number of ounces sold was down from s level and operating costs were higher  rising gold prices during yielded an increase in revenues that exceeded the impact of lower ounces and higher operating costs 
realized gold prices averaged  per ounce during  up from  per ounce in lower ore grades and less tonnes of ore processed at both bogoso and at wassa contributed to the loss  as did higher cash operating costs at both operations 
consolidated cash operating costs totaled million  up from million in the increase in cash operating costs reflects significant increases in prices of many of our key operating inputs including the prices paid for electric power  labor  cyanide  fuel  and other reagents used in processing plants 
higher cash operating costs also reflect an increase in waste mining activities in as compared to see bogoso s operational discussion below for more details on cost increases 
depreciation charges in were down million from due to lower ounces sold at bogoso and at wassa  and due to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense per ounce from the increase in gold reserves at the end of summary of financial results gold sales oz average realized gold price oz revenues in thousands cash flow provided by operations in thousands net income loss attributable to golden star in thousands net income loss per share attributable to golden star basic gold hedging activities during resulted in a loss of million  up from a million loss in most of these losses were related to forward gold price contracts which lost value during the year as gold prices rose 
see note of the attached financial statements for additional discussion of the gold forward contracts 
offsetting the gold derivative losses in was a million gain on fair value of the option feature in our convertible debentures 
the gain was in response to lower prices of our common shares which resulted in a lower value of the option feature 
in comparison  we recorded a million loss on the fair value of the conversion feature of our convertible debentures in in response to rising prices for our common shares 
see note of the attached financial statements for additional disclosure on fair value adjustments to our convertible debentures 
interest expense totaled million in  down marginally from million in  reflecting lower balances on our equipment financing loans during as loan balances were paid down 
corporate general and administrative costs totaled million in  up from million in most of the increase was related to one time corporate advisory and consulting fees totaling million  increases in non cash stock compensation expense  addition of a technical services group and higher option and personnel costs 
the consulting expense was related to an independent review performed at our mine sites to improve production processes and to lower operating costs 
this project was competed in and we do not expect to commission similar studies in the increase in income tax expense from reflects higher income in ghana at wassa 
bogoso prestea operations compared to bogoso prestea operating results ore mined refractory t ore mined non refractory t total ore mined t waste mined t refractory ore processed t refractory ore grade g t gold recovery refractory ore non refractory ore processed t non refractory ore grade g t gold recovery non refractory ore gold sales oz cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz bogoso prestea s revenues totaled in  up from million in the same period of while the number of ounces sold was lower than in  increases in realized gold prices during more than offset the impact of lower ounces 
bogoso s realized gold price averaged  per ounce during  up from  per ounce a year earlier 
bogoso sold  ounces in  down from  ounces in decreases in tonnes processed and lower plant feed grade were the major factors contributing to the drop in ounces sold 
the decrease in grade as compared to reflects a change in ore source 
in  bogoso s main feed source was the higher grade buesichem pit  but mining was completed at the buesichem pit in the third quarter of and subsequently bogoso moved its mining fleet to other pits at bogoso where ore grades have been lower than at buesichem 
the drop in tonnes processed  as compared to  reflects lower availability of ore in recent quarters as we pursued an accelerated waste stripping program at the chujah pit to allow a more steady supply of ore in subsequent periods 
bogoso s cash operating costs totaled million during  up from million in the largest item contributing to bogoso s increase in cash operating costs was a million tonne increase in waste tonnes mined which resulted in higher equipment rental costs  additional equipment maintenance costs and additional equipment operating costs 
increases in the price of electric power  fuel  cyanide and labor  as compared to  also contributed to higher operating costs as did higher maintenance expense than a year earlier 
more specifically  in late  the actual price we paid for mine truck tires was up from a year earlier 
similarly  the price we paid for electricity was higher  our fuel price was up  explosives were up and the cost of cyanide was up 
a decrease in the number of ounces sold and higher cash operating costs resulted in a  per ounce cash operating cost in  up from per ounce during bogoso s royalty costs were higher than a year earlier due to higher revenues and an increase in the government of ghana s royalty rate from in to in the drop in ounces sold contributed to lower units of production amortization expense  as did an increase in gold reserves at the end of cost analysis and cost control planning was a major focus at all operational sites during  and implementation of the new cost control programs are expected in early as part of the cost control efforts  we carried out an extensive mine planning exercise in late to determine the the optimum sequencing of the future bogoso prestea pits to provide a steady  long term flow of oxide and sulfide ore to the bogoso oxide and sulfide processing plants 
mining of oxide ore was initiated at the pampe pit west of bogoso late in the third quarter of and the bogoso oxide plant was brought on line in the first quarter of in addition  we received final permits required to begin recovery and re processing old bogoso tails materials through the bogoso oxide plant 
based on these new developments  we now expect that the combination of pampe oxide ore and the recovery of oxidized tailings will allow continuous  or near continuous  oxide plant operating throughout and beyond 
since the processing costs of oxide ores are typically lower than for other ore types at bogoso prestea  we expect reductions in average cash operating costs per ounce in as compared to we expect that sulfide mining rates will be lower than in with a lower strip ratio and we expect an increase in sulfide ore tonnes processed 
sulfide gold recovery rates should remain near the rate established in the second half of while sulfide feed grades are expected to drop below levels  expected increases in processing rates and recovery should more than offset this  resulting in an increase in ounces sold versus resumption of operations at the oxide processing plant should also contribute to higher gold sales in during  the prestea underground mine remained on a care and maintenance basis 
in late  our new technical services group began a pre feasibility study to evaluate economic potential of developing the prestea underground mine using mechanized mining methods 
wassa hbb operations compared to wassa hbb operating results ore mined t waste mined t ore processed t ore grade processed g t recovery gold sales oz cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz wassa sold  ounces during  down from  ounces in a drop in ore grade to g t from g t in was the major factor contributing to the reduction in ounces sold 
ore grades fell as mining proceeded into lower grade areas of the wassa and hbb ore bodies during higher realized gold prices offset the impact of lower ounces sold to yield revenues of million  up from million in wassa s realized gold price averaged  per ounce during  up from  per ounce a year earlier 
cash operating costs totaled million in  up from million in increases in the price of electric power  fuel  cyanide  labor and maintenance contributed to higher operating costs 
see the bogoso discussion of costs  immediately above  for additional details on increases in the price of key items consumed in our operations 
the drop in ounces sold as compared to  coupled with higher cash operating costs  resulted in an increase in cash operating cost per ounce to  as compared to per ounce in mining operations were completed at benso in february  and we plan to increase mining rates at the wassa area pits to compensate for the benso closure 
while the wassa pits should make up for the benso tonnage  wassa ore grades are lower than what has been mined at benso and this will result in lower overall feed grades and lower gold output at wassa hbb in as compared to the new father brown pit at hwini butre came on line in the fourth quarter of  replacing ore from other hwini butre pits that were closed upon completion of mining 
it is expected that the remaining life of the hwini butre mining operation is now approximately two to two and one half years  after which all or most of the ore feed to the wassa plant will come from wassa area pits 
during  hwini butre should provide approximately of the wassa plant ore tonnes at an average grade of approximately g t 
the balance of the wassa plant feed is expected to come from wassa area pits 
results of operations compared to consolidated results consolidated financial results include a net loss attributable to golden star of million or per share as compared to a net loss attributable to golden star of million or per share in while gold prices were higher than in  a drop in ounces sold combined with an increase in cost of sales to yield a million drop in mine operating margin to million  down from million in but a smaller loss from changes in the fair value of the convertible debentures and lower interest expense combined to produce a million pre tax loss for  down from a pre tax loss of million in in both and  the loss from changes in the fair value of the convertible debentures was caused by increasing share prices for our common stock which resulted in an increase in the value of the conversion feature of the debentures and an increase in the amount of our liability associated with the outstanding debentures 
the loss in was much less than in  simply because the increase on our share price in was much less than the increase during our consolidated tax expense was million  as compared to an million tax benefit in the benefit was a result of recognizing wassa s deferred tax assets at the end of upon transfer of the hbb mining leases to wassa and improved operational performance at wassa 
the million tax expense in reflects the ongoing use of wassa s tax assets to offset taxable income  and the cost of a temporary tax levy in ghana 
gold sales totaled  ounces in  down from  ounces sold in the major factors contributing to the decrease in gold sold were lower gold recovery at bogoso and lower ore grades at wassa 
realized gold prices averaged  per ounce during  up from per ounce in wassa processed essentially the same tonnes in as in  but ore grades were lower than in as mining moved into lower grade areas of the benso and hwini butre ore bodies during in contrast  bogoso processed higher grade ore during than in  but its gold output was adversely impacted by lower gold recoveries during most of the year 
lower gold recovery at bogoso was related to a change in ore sources during the year 
in and the first quarter of  bogoso s main ore source was fresh ore from deep in the buesichem pit  which yielded good recoveries 
by mid  the buesichem pit was exhausted and bogoso moved its main mining fleet to the chujah main pit where mining in the initial benches encountered partially oxidized ore which yielded lower flotation recovery of the gold 
bogoso initiated mining at the bogoso north pit in october to supplement the chujah main pit ore 
see additional discussion of wassa and bogoso s operations below 
our general and administrative expense was million  up million over the level 
the increase was mostly due to higher community development spending in ghana and to higher stock based compensation expense 
the corporate office overhead expense  excluding stock based compensation expense  was up from property holding costs are primarily the costs incurred in care and maintenance activities at the prestea underground project 
bogoso prestea operations compared to bogoso prestea gold shipments totaled  ounces in at an average gold price of  per ounce  down from  ounces in at an average price of per ounce 
while plant feed grades and total tonnes processed were marginally higher in  a drop in gold recovery resulted in lower gold output 
the drop in refractory ore gold recovery to in from in was related to a change in ore sources during the year 
in and the first quarter of  bogoso s main feed source was fresh ore from deep in the buesichem pit which yielded good recoveries 
but by mid  the buesichem pit was exhausted and bogoso moved its main mining fleet to the chujah main pit where mining encountered partially oxidized ore at shallow levels resulting in lower flotation recovery of the gold 
bogoso also processed stockpiled transition ores at various times late in  which also contributed to lower gold recovery rates 
the bogoso north pit was opened in the fourth quarter of to provide additional ore 
unusually heavy rainfall in the second half of and de watering issues impeded mining operations and pit scheduling at both chujah and bogoso north 
the bogoso sulfide plant processed refractory ore throughout the year  and in various periods the oxide plant was operated to provide additional refractory concentrate to the bio oxidation circuit 
in the fourth quarter of  the oxide plant processed oxide ore from a small stockpile accumulated from sundry sources over the past few quarters 
bogoso prestea s cash operating costs totaled million in  up from million in higher electric power  fuel  cyanide and labor costs were the key items responsible for bogoso s cost increase 
higher cash operating costs coupled with lower gold output pushed cash operating costs to per ounce  up from per ounce in the current portion of bogoso s asset retirement obligation increased in due to the need to back fill the plant north pit at prestea  and to rehabilitate the associated waste rock dump site 
these two items are expected to cost approximately million during wassa hbb operations compared to while wassa processed essentially the same number of tonnes of ore in as it did in  ore grades and gold recovery were lower resulting in lower gold sales 
in addition  wassa experienced increases in its cash operating costs  the effects of which were offset by higher gold prices 
wassa sold  ounces in at an average realized gold price of  per ounce as compared to  ounces at an average realized price of per ounce in lower plant feed grade in reflected a transition of mining into lower grade areas of the benso and hwini butre pits during cash operating costs rose to million in  up from million in increases in labor  fuel  explosives and electric power accounted for most of the increase over levels 
also  as wassa ramped up its mining effort at benso and hwini butre during  it incurred higher costs for contract mining  ore haulage costs and equipment rental than in wassa hbb moved a total of million tonnes of ore and waste in  as compared to million tonnes in the higher cash costs and lower gold sales contributed to a cash operating cost of per ounce in  as compared to per ounce in lower gold production resulted in lower depreciation and amortization costs which were down million from development projects pampe and the bogoso oxide plant refurbishment during the third quarter of  we restarted mining operations at the pampe oxide property located kilometers west of the bogoso processing plant site 
it is expected that pampe oxide ores will be less expensive to process than the bogoso sulfide ores and should yield better gold recovery rates 
pampe oxide ore was stockpiled during the balance of  and the bogoso oxide plant began processing the ore in february in anticipation of the pampe oxide ore  the oxide plant was refurbished in bogoso tailings recovery project construction continued at bogoso on our hydraulic tailings recovery system which is designed to feed tailings from decommissioned bogoso tailings storage facilities directly into the bogoso oxide plant s cil circuit 
the final environmental permit needed for start up was received in october while the grade of the tailings material is lower than that of the ores typically treated in the bogoso oxide plant in the past  operating costs are expected to be low since reclaimed tailings can be fed directly into the existing cil circuit without crushing or grinding 
thus  ore processing costs will be lower than for freshly mined ore  resulting in lower overall average costs per ounce at bogoso 
it is expected that this material will be a supplemental feed to oxide ores mined from pampe and later from prestea south once mining is initiated there later in prestea south properties during  we continued to seek environmental permits required to develop the prestea south oxide deposits 
in  the ghana epa requested an update to the prestea south project environmental impact statement eis and a revised draft eis was submitted to the epa in april when the environmental permits are obtained  we expect to initiate development at prestea south deposits  including its kilometer haul road extension 
we plan to transport prestea south oxide ore to bogoso and process it through the bogoso oxide plant 
prestea south sulfide ore will be processed through the bogoso sulfide plant 
exploration projects exploration expenditures totaled approximately million during  up from million in the exploration programs concentrated on drilling at buesichem south  bogoso north  chujah and pampe at bogoso prestea  and resource delineation drilling at wassa hbb 
the wassa area program focused on resource extensions along strike and at depth 
we also drill tested various zones at hwini butre including underground targets at father brown 
there were no exploration activities at the prestea underground in  but we continued with engineering studies to assess the economic potential of resuming underground mining activities 
exploration activities continued on our niger properties where ami resources  who is party to an earn in agreement  continued drilling at deba and tialkam 
in burkina faso  riverstone resources  which has an option to purchase the goulagou and rounga properties  also carried out a drilling program 
in february  riverstone resources exercised their purchase option and acquired our burkina faso properties 
exploration activity was limited in sierra leone and cote d ivoire during due to license issues and political instability  respectively  in these two areas 
in south america  exploration efforts concentrated on the iriri joint venture in northern mato grosso state in brazil  where we have the ability to earn a ownership position in a  square kilometer land package held by votorantim metals 
the iriri joint venture is a green fields project encompassing regional  wide spaced soil and stream sediment sampling 
during  sampling programs covered approximately of the  square kilometer area with the remaining area to be sampled in after the seasonal rains end 
the saramacca property  located in suriname  consists of three concessions totaling approximately square kilometers 
in  newmont mining corporation newmont earned a interest in the saramacca project by having spent million on exploration and has since taken over management of the project 
also in  we entered into an agreement with newmont to sell them our remaining interest in the saramacca joint venture for approximately million subject to the government of suriname s transfer of ownership of the exploration license to newmont 
the joint venture has continued work on the property since that date  investing a further million in drilling and development 
newmont has spent the past two years seeking transfer of the license but the government of suriname has still not agreed to the transfer 
in the interim  newmont submitted a feasibility study to the government of suriname in requesting conversion of the prospecting licenses to an exploitation license and discussions on this request are also on going 
when the license transfer is completed we expect to receive the million purchase price  which is currently being held in escrow 
exploration plans we have budgeted approximately million for exploration activities in  much of which will be focused on resource definition at wassa and further drill testing of the father brown underground potential at hwini butre 
the exploration programs at wassa were successful in identifying and delineating higher grade zones below the current pits designs and as a result  this higher grade material could allow the existing wassa pits to go deeper than initially expected 
the wassa drilling program will incorporate pit optimization planning to help focus drilling in areas where higher grade material may provide the best economics and pit shell expansions 
the drilling at the father brown underground targets will focus on testing extensions of the mineralization along strike and at depth 
we expect that during  west african exploration programs outside of ghana will include deep auger drilling at our amelekia concessions in cote d ivoire 
our sonfon project in sierra leone will remain on care and maintenance until the license issue with the government has been resolved 
the south american exploration effort will focus on the iriri joint venture in brazil as well as the transfer of the saramacca licenses in suriname to newmont 
the iriri joint venture programs plan to concentrate on finishing the regional stream sediment sampling programs over the remaining area not covered in our sampling program 
upon completion of the wide spaced surface sampling program  follow up sampling programs will be designed to explore any identified anomalies 
our current plan is to have several soil anomalies delineated by the end of the  which can become drilling targets in subsequent years 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash operating margin  gold revenues less the cash components of cost of goods sold as found in note to the attached financial statements totaled million during this cash was used to cover various non operating costs and changes in working capital during  bringing cash from operations to million for the full year 
non operating uses of cash included million for reclamation projects  for corporate general and administrative costs  million used to settle gold forward sales contracts  million for working capital needs  for non mine site exploration costs and property holding costs 
we expect cash requirements for many of these cost items will decrease in the unusually large reclamation spending in was mostly related to backfilling of plant north pit at prestea 
the backfilling was completed by the end of  and we expect a significant reduction in reclamation spending in similarly  most of the cash used in working capital during was related to increases in ore stockpiles in the fourth quarter 
furthermore  all gold forward purchase contracts expired in and thus will not require cash payments in and lastly  corporate general and administrative costs included a large one time consulting project  and as a result  we expect lower costs here as well in a total of million was used in investing activities during  including million on mining property development projects and million for the acquisition of new equipment and facilities at the mine sites 
major capital items during included new mining equipment  development drilling at the operating mine sites  tailing dam enhancements  a new water treatment plant at bogoso  processing plant enhancements  capitalization of pre stripping costs and costs of the tailings reclaim project at bogoso 
scheduled debt payments on our equipment financing facility used million of cash and new borrowings on this facility provided million of cash 
while the mines provided sufficient cash to meet all of our operating and non operating needs  during investing activities were essentially funded by a reduction in cash on hand bringing our cash balance down from million at december   to million at december  during  all of our cash was held as cash or was invested in funds that held only us treasury notes and bonds 
liquidity outlook we expect to spend up to million on capital projects at bogoso prestea and wassa hbb during in addition  we expect to spend million on rehabilitation projects at bogoso prestea and wassa hbb during the major planned capital projects in include a new tailings pond facility at wassa  a water treatment plant at bogoso  new mining equipment  additional mine development drilling and upgrades to the bogoso sulfide plant 
we plan to use approximately million of cash for payments on the equipment financing loans and we expect to draw approximately million on new equipment loans in to replace mining equipment 
during  we plan to pay million of interest on our equipment financing facility  and million of interest payments on the convertible debentures 
as of december   the company had a negative working capital position of million  which includes cash of million and a current liability for our convertible debenture of million 
our convertible debentures  due in november  became a current liability in the fourth quarter of  which caused our current liabilities to exceed current assets 
the options available to settle this liability include cash  re financing of the debt  payment in common shares  or a combination of shares and cash 
while it is our current intent to redeem these debentures with cash in november  or depending upon market conditions  refinance the debentures using long term debt  the debentures contain a provision for settlement in common shares 
on maturity  we may  at our option  satisfy the repayment obligation by paying the full million principal amount of the debentures in cash or  alternatively by issuing up to million common shares to the debenture holders 
if we opt to settle in shares  we must redeem all  and not less than all  of the debentures by issuing up to million shares 
the value assigned to the shares issued will be determined as of the weighted average trading price of our common shares on the nyse amex stock exchange for the consecutive trading days ending five trading days preceding the maturity date 
if the value assigned to the shares multiplied by million shares is insufficient to cover the entire million liability  we would be required to pay cash  in addition to the shares issued  in an amount that when added to the value of the shares will equal million 
if required  the share issuance option would not impact our cash position to the extent shares are used to retire the debt 
we also maintain a million revolving line of credit which had nil outstanding at december  this revolving credit facility expires on september  we also have million of borrowing capacity at december   under our equipment financing credit facility which has an indefinite life 
we expect that our operating cash flow  along with cash on hand at december   and the equipment financing facility  will be sufficient to cover capital  operating and debt needs during however  since our operating cash flows are sensitive to fluctuations in gold price  a prolonged down turn in gold price could adversely impact our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our needs during looking ahead our main objectives for include start up bogoso s oxide processing plant early in using pampe ore and  later in  begin feeding bogoso tailings materials  achieve reductions in operating costs throughout the organization  continue exploration drilling at the wassa mining lease to follow up on the drilling results  complete prestea underground pre feasibility study and if warranted prepare a development and financing plan  and re evaluation of all mining plans and equipment needs for continued longer term profitable operation 
we are estimating a bogoso prestea gold production of  to  ounces at an average cash operating cost of  to  per ounce 
we expect wassa to produce approximately  to  ounces during at an average cash operating cost of to per ounce  with combined total production of approximately  to  ounces at an average cash operating cost of  to  per ounce 
as more fully disclosed in the risk factors in item a of this form k  numerous factors could cause our estimates and expectations to be wrong or could lead to changes in our plans 
under any of these circumstances  the estimates described above could change materially

certain exploration properties have been found to be impaired in the past and were written off in prior years 
we continue to retain title to certain properties after impairment write offs as future events and discoveries may ultimately prove that they have value 
listed below are the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements based on the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
ore stockpiles stockpiles represent coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing 
stockpiles are measured by physical surveys or by estimating the number of tonnes of ore added and removed from the stockpile during a period 
the number of recoverable ounces of gold in stockpiles is based on assay data and the gold recovery rate expected when the ore is processed 
stockpile values include mining and mine maintenances costs incurred in bringing the ore to the stockpile  and also a share of direct overhead and applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization relating to mining operations 
costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and are removed at the average cost per tonne of the total stockpile 
stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and fed to the processing plant 
a adjustment to the volume of the stockpile  based on typical stockpile tonnage  would change the carrying value of the stockpile inventory by approximately to million 
impairment charges we periodically review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable from continued operation of the asset 
an asset impairment is considered to exist if the sum of all estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are less than the carrying value of the long lived asset 
the determination of expected future cash flows requires numerous estimates about the future  including gold prices  operating costs  production levels  gold recovery rates  reclamation spending  ore reserves  amounts of recoverable gold and capital expenditures 
amortization capital expenditures for mining properties  mine development and certain property plant and equipment items  are amortized using a units of production method over proven and probable mineral reserve ounces of gold 
capital expenditures that benefit an entire mining property  such as the cost of building an administrative facility  are amortized over all ounces contained on the property 
capital expenditures that benefit only a specific asset such as the pre production stripping costs of a pit  are amortized over only the ounces located in the associated pit 
reserve estimates  which serve as the denominator in units of production amortization calculations  involve the exercise of subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions about future operating costs  future gold prices  continuity of mineralization  future gold recovery rates  spatial configuration of gold deposits  and other factors that may prove to be incorrect 
a adjustment in estimated total december   reserves at wassa and at bogoso prestea could result in an approximately million annual change in amortization expense 
tax assets recognition of future tax assets requires an analysis of future taxable income expectations to evaluate the probability of sufficient future taxable income to utilize the accrued tax benefits 
determination of expected future taxable income requires numerous estimates of future variable including but not limited to  gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  ore reserves  gold production  ore grades  administrative costs  tax rates  and potential changes in tax laws 
asset retirement obligation and reclamation expenditures accounting for future reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates  at each mine site  of future reclamation and closure costs 
in many cases a majority of such costs are incurred at the end of a mine s life which can be several years in the future 
such estimates are subject to changes in mine plans  reclamation requirements  inflation rates and technology 
as a result  future reclamation and closure costs are difficult to estimate 
our estimates of future reclamation and closing cost are reviewed frequently and are adjusted as needed to reflect new information about the timing and expected future costs of our environmental disturbances 
based upon our current situation  we estimate that a increases in total future reclamation and closure cash costs would result in an approximately million increase in our asset retirement obligations 
accounting developments see note to the financial statements attached below this management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements 
adoption of us gaap in golden star has  since its inception  reported to security regulators in both canada and the us using canadian gaap financial statements with a foot note reconciliation to us gaap 
however  a change in sec position in late required that after  canadian companies such as golden star  which do not qualify as foreign private issuers  file their financial statements in the us using us gaap after in response  we adopted us gaap for years beginning on or after january  for all future us  ghanaian and canadian regulatory filings 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
table of contractual obligations payment due in millions by period total less than year to years to years more than years debt interest on long term debt operating lease obligations capital lease obligations asset retirement obligations total includes million of convertible debentures maturing in november golden star has the right to repay the million in cash or in common shares at the due date under certain circumstances 
the presentation shown above assumes payment is made in cash and also assumes no conversions of the debt to common shares by the holders prior to the maturity date 
asset retirement obligations include estimates about future reclamation costs  mining schedules  timing of the performance of reclamation work and the quantity of ore reserves  an analysis of which determines the ultimate closure date and impacts the discounted amounts of future asset retirement liabilities 
the discounted value of these projected cash flows is recorded as asset retirement obligations on the balance sheet of million as of december  the amounts shown above are undiscounted to show full expected cash requirements 
outstanding share data this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes information available to february  as of february   we had outstanding  common shares  options to acquire  common shares  and convertible notes which are convertible into  common shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in interest rates on our debt  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity price fluctuations 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates 
our convertible senior unsecured debentures and the outstanding loans under our equipment financing facility bear interest at a fixed rate and are not subject to gains or losses in interest rate 
our revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate of the higher of the applicable lender s cost of funds capped at per annum above libor and libor plus a margin of 
as of december   there was a nil balance outstanding on this facility 
we have not entered into any agreements to hedge against unfavorable changes in interest rates  but may in the future actively manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk currency risk is risk that the fair value of future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  the value of cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates 
since our revenues are denominated in us dollars and our operating units transact much of their business in us dollars  we are typically not subject to significant impacts from currency fluctuations 
even thus  certain purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in ghana cedis  euros  british pounds  australian dollars and south african rand 
to accommodate these purchases  we maintain operating cash accounts in non us dollar currencies and appreciation of these non us dollar currencies against the us dollar results in a foreign currency gain and a decrease in non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
in the past we have entered into forward purchase contracts for south african rand  euros and other currencies to hedge expected purchase costs of capital assets 
during and we had no currency related derivatives 
at december   and we held million and million  respectively  of foreign currency 
commodity price risk gold is our primary product and  as a result  changes in the price of gold significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows 
based on our expected gold production in  a per ounce change in gold price would result in approximately a million change in our sales revenues and operating cash flows 
to reduce gold price volatility  we have at various times entered into gold price derivatives 
at december   and december   we did not hold any gold price derivatives and thus  there were no financial instruments subject to gold price risk at those dates 
we held gold price derivatives at various times during and information on these gold price derivatives can be found in note of our financial statements 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that we will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset 
we manage the liquidity risk inherent in these financial obligations by preparing quarterly forecasts and annual long term budgets which forecast cash needs and expected cash availability to meet future obligations 
typically these obligations are met by cash flows from operations and from cash on hand 
scheduling of capital spending and acquisitions of financial resources may also be employed  as needed and as available  to meeting the cash demands of our obligations 
our ability to repay or refinance our future obligations depends on a number of factors  some of which may be beyond our control 
factors that influence our ability to meet these obligations include general global economic conditions  credit and capital market conditions  results of operations and the price of gold 
credit risk credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation 
our credit risk is primarily associated with liquid financial assets and derivatives 
we limit exposure to credit risk on liquid financial assets by holding our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and deposits at highly rated financial institutions and during  all of our excess cash was invested in funds that hold only us treasury bills 
we mitigate the credit risks of our derivatives by entering into derivative contracts with only high quality counter parties 
risks associated with gold trade receivables is considered minimal as we sell gold to a credit worthy buyer who settles promptly within a week of receipt of gold bullion
