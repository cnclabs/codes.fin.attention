item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended december    and included with this report 
unless otherwise noted  both historical information for all periods and forward looking information provided in this management s discussion and analysis relates solely to our continuing operations located in the united states  and excludes our new zealand operations discontinued since late the following information contains forward looking statements  see forward looking statements on page of this report 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company formed in  and we are engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and operation of oil and natural gas properties  with a focus on our reserves and production from our texas properties as well as onshore and inland waters of louisiana 
we are one of the largest producers of crude oil in the state of louisiana  and hold a large acreage position in texas prospective for eagle ford shale and olmos tight sands development 
oil production accounted for of our production and of our oil and gas revenues  and combined production of both oil and natural gas liquids ngls constituted of our production and of our oil and gas sales 
this emphasis has allowed us to benefit from better margins for oil production than natural gas production during highlights production our production was higher than volumes on a boe basis  with the increased volumes mainly coming from natural gas and ngls produced in our south texas area 
increased reserves our year end total proved reserves increased over our year end reserves by to a company record of mmboe 
this increase was mainly due to large increases in natural gas reserves in our south texas area 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million or  as oil and ngl prices received in were and higher than the average prices we received in along with the impact of south texas production increases 
disposition activity in october  we sold our interests in six fields in south louisiana  two in texas and one in alabama for million  net of million in purchase price adjustments and the buyer s assumption of approximately million of asset retirement obligations related to these properties 
debt issuance and available liquidity we issued million of senior notes due in november at a discount of million  leading to excellent liquidity leading into capital expenditures our capital expenditures on a cash flow basis were million in compared to million spent in the increase of million was mainly due to additional drilling and completion activity in our south texas core region as we drilled horizontal wells in our awp olmos field  wells in our awp eagle ford field  six wells in our fasken eagle ford field and three wells in our artesia eagle ford field  helping us evaluate eagle ford and olmos acreage positions in those areas 
we also drilled two wells in our southeast louisiana area and four wells in our central louisiana east texas area 
these expenditures were primarily funded by million of cash provided by operating activities  asset disposition proceeds  and remaining cash proceeds from our stock offering in november strategy and outlook focus on oil and liquids properties with expanded capital budget our inventory of drilling locations allows us to be flexible in scheduling upcoming wells to focus on liquids 

having fulfilled our near term obligations on most of our acreage prospective for dry natural gas production  we will be concentrating on our higher return  liquids rich acreage almost exclusively this year 
our capital expenditures are currently estimated to be to million with to focused on continued development in the liquids rich acreage in the eagle ford shale and the olmos sands in our south texas area 
increase production our current goal is to increase production volumes by to over volumes 
increase reserves our current goal is to increase proved reserves volumes by to 
financial flexibility at december   we have approximately million of cash on hand and a commitment amount of million under our credit agreement 
these amounts give us the financial flexibility to execute our strategy 
added mid stream capacity and third party providers additional dedicated transportation and processing through a newly constructed third party pipeline of a mid stream provider handling natural gas production from our awp eagle ford and olmos areas became operational at the beginning of october in our fasken eagle ford area we also secured capacity on a pipeline built in late by a midstream provider 
in both awp eagle ford and fasken eagle ford areas we have secondary transportation outlets available if capacity is restricted on our primary outlets 
highly skilled workforce we have built a strong organization of highly skilled oil and gas professionals and also engage experienced and qualified consultants 
these professionals are critical to us executing our goals 
capital cost saving measures we have realized significant capital cost savings in south texas related to pad drilling  well construction and completion re design  sourcing and transportation of proppants as well as increased productivity of our dedicated frac spread and crew 
our supply chain program continues to be extremely important and the relationships that we have developed with our service providers are critical to our program execution 
known trends and uncertainties affecting our business recent declines in natural gas prices several factors such as increases in shale and tight sands production  mild winter weather  and relatively high natural gas storage levels have led to declining natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of and into futures prices for natural gas in are currently lower than our realized prices 
we have not hedged our natural gas production and will receive a market price for natural gas in lower natural gas prices equate to lower revenue and cash flows and might lead to reductions in our credit facility borrowing base 
as natural gas makes up of our reserves base on a boe basis  lower natural gas prices in could lead to potential reserve reductions which could result in full cost ceiling write downs 
employee retention as our competitors expand their workforce  we must focus more attention on keeping our highly skilled employees 
there has been and will be constant cost pressure to retain and hire these employees and these costs do not decline as rapidly and significantly as hydrocarbon prices 
oilfield services shortages and delays during periods of increased levels of exploration and production in particular areas  such as we are currently experiencing in the south texas areas  there is increased demand for drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  oilfield services  and trained and experienced personnel 
the high demand in these areas has caused shortages and delays  which has raised costs and often delayed field development 
long term capital commitments in an effort to secure longer term agreements on drilling rigs  fracturing services  equipment and supplies  our capital commitments have become more significant than in prior periods 
although these ensure that rigs and crews we need are available to use  these commitments may also reduce our liquidity in a downturn and may require us to pay above market prices for services in a declining service price environment 
high concentration of sales with one customer over the last several years  a large portion of our oil and gas sales have been to shell oil corporation and affiliates and we expect to continue this relationship in the future 
we believe that the risk of these unsecured receivables is mitigated by the size  reputation  and nature of their business 
results of operations revenues our revenues in increased by compared to revenues in due to higher oil and ngl prices as well as higher ngl and natural gas production 
average oil prices that we received were higher than those received during  while natural gas prices were lower  and ngl prices were higher 
our revenues in increased by compared to revenues in due to higher oil and gas prices after taking into account decreased production as a result of intentional reduction of drilling activity in s low price environment 
average oil prices that we received were higher than those received during  while natural gas prices were higher  and ngl prices were higher 
crude oil production was of our production volumes in  in  and in crude oil sales were of total sales in  in  and in natural gas production was of our production volumes in  and in both and natural gas sales were of sales in  in  and in the remaining production in each year was from natural gas liquids ngls

costs and expenses 
our expenses in increased million  or  compared to expenses for the reasons noted below which was less than the percentage increase in revenues between the two periods 
lease operating expenses loe 
these expenses increased  compared to the level of such expenses in  while costs increased over levels 
lease operating costs increased during due to higher salt water disposal costs and higher transportations costs in south texas 
the increase in was due to higher workover costs and other cost increases from lease supervision and repair maintenance 
our lease operating costs per boe produced were   and in   and  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
these expenses increased in from levels and decreased in from levels 
the increase in was due to a higher depletable base  higher production volumes and higher future development costs 
the decrease in was due to lower production and higher reserves  partially offset by a higher depletion base 
our dd a rate per boe of production was in  in  and in  resulting from increases in per unit cost of reserves additions in and general and administrative expenses  net 
these expenses increased  from the level of such expenses in  while expenses increased  from the level of such expenses in the increase in was primarily due to higher performance based compensation and higher salaries and burdens 
the increase in was primarily due to higher performance based compensation  partially offset by lower salaries and burdens 
for the years   and  our capitalized general and administrative costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
our net general and administrative expenses per boe produced decreased to per boe in from per boe in  but higher than per boe in the portion of supervision fees recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses was million for  million for  and million for severance and other taxes 
these expenses increased  from levels  while in these taxes increased  over levels 
the increase in was due primarily to higher revenues from higher production and commodity prices 
in the increases were due primarily to higher revenue from higher commodity prices 
severance and other taxes  as a percentage of oil and gas sales  were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
the decreases in and were primarily driven by a shift in product and regional mix as well as reduced tax rates for tight sand gas production related to south texas olmos and eagle ford completions 
interest 
our gross interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to interest on our new senior note due that were issued in november income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
our us federal income tax returns for forward  our louisiana income tax returns from forward  our new zealand income tax returns after  and our texas franchise tax returns after remain subject to examination by the taxing authorities 
there are no material unresolved items related to periods previously audited by these taxing authorities 
no other state returns are significant to our financial position 
ceiling test non cash writedowns 
in the first quarter of  as a result of low oil and natural gas prices at march  we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and natural gas properties 
final recognition of new zealand sales proceeds 
in august  we completed the sale of our remaining new zealand permit for million  with three million payments spread over a month period 
the company initially deferred the gain on the sale due to legal claims around the transfer of this property 
in july  a settlement was reached and all legal claims were dismissed 
as a result in the second quarter of  the company recognized sale proceeds of million  net of million in capitalized costs in assets held for sale  relating to our remaining new zealand permit 
as of december  all payments under this sale agreement had been received and of the company s oil and gas operations resided in the united states of america 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million  representing a increase as compared to million generated during the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in oil and gas sales  mainly due to higher oil and ngl prices along with a significant increase in natural gas production 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million  represented a increase from the million generated during  with this increase primarily due to an increase of million in revenues  mainly attributable to higher oil and natural gas prices  partially offset by a combination of lower production  higher lease operating costs and higher severance taxes due to higher oil and gas sales 
existing credit facility 
in may  we renewed and extended our million credit facility with a syndicate of ten banks through may  during the may renewal  our borrowing base  as determined by our bank syndicate  was increased from million to million  and we elected to keep the commitment amount  which represents the limit on our borrowings without unanimous lender consent  at million  all of which was reaffirmed in our november regularly scheduled borrowing base redetermination 
the borrowing base was subsequently decreased at the end of november to million  in accordance with the terms of our credit facility  due to the issuance of million of senior notes senior notes due in we had no amounts drawn under our credit facility as of december  and  as such  had million of borrowing capacity 
our available borrowings under our credit facility provide us liquidity 
in light of credit market volatility in recent years  which caused many financial institutions to experience liquidity issues  we periodically review the creditworthiness of the banks that fund our credit facility 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional terms and restrictions of our credit facility 
debt issuance 
we issued million of senior notes due in november at a discount of of face value 
the proceeds from this debt issuance were recorded in cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  and will be used to fund capital expenditures in and public stock offerings 
we raised million net through an underwritten public stock offering in november  issuing million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we used the proceeds from this stock sale to expand our south texas drilling program and pay down a portion of the outstanding balance on our credit facility which  resulted in increased liquidity 
in august  we raised million net through an underwritten public stock offering in august  issuing million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we used the proceeds from this stock sale to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance on our credit facility which  resulted in increased liquidity 
debt issuance and debt retirement 
we issued million of senior notes due in november at of face value 
in december  we redeemed all million of senior notes due financial ratios working capital and debt to capitalization 
our working capital increased from a surplus of million at december   to a surplus of million at december  the change primarily resulted from an increase in cash and cash equivalents as we received cash from our debt offering in november working capital  which is calculated as current assets less current liabilities  can be used to measure both a company s operational efficiency and short term financial health 
the company uses this measure to track our short term financial position 
not included in our working capital ratio is available liquidity through our credit facility 
our debt to capitalization ratio increased to at december   as compared to at december   primarily due to the debt issuance 
contractual commitments and obligations our contractual commitments for the next five years and thereafter as of december  are as follows thereafter total in thousands non cancelable operating leases asset retirement obligation drilling rigs and completion services gas transportation and processing facility construction costs senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due interest cost credit facility total our most significant office lease is in houston  texas and it extends until amounts shown by year are the net present value at december  amounts shown represent fees for the minimum delivery obligations 
any amount of transportation utilized in excess of the minimum will reduce future year obligations the credit facility expires in may and these amounts exclude million standby letters of credit outstanding under this facility 
as of december  we had no off balance sheet arrangements requiring disclosure pursuant to article a of regulation s k 
proved oil and gas reserves we have added proved reserves over the past three years primarily through our drilling activities  including mmboe added in  mmboe added in  and mmboe added in the proved reserves additions from drilling activities consisted almost entirely of reserves additions within our south texas area  most of which were proved undeveloped additions based on the results of the horizontal drilling program conducted in this area during the year 
we obtained reasonable certainty regarding these reserves additions by applying the same methodologies that have been used historically in this area 
at year end  of our total proved reserves were proved developed  compared with at year end and at year end at year end  our proved reserves were mmboe with a pv value of billion pv is a non gaap measure  see the section titled oil and natural gas reserves in our property section for a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to the closest gaap measure  the standardized measure  an increase in pv of approximately million from the prior year end levels 
in  our proved natural gas reserves increased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves decreased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves increased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of mmboe  or 
we use the preceding months average price based on closing prices on the first business day of each month in calculating our average prices used in the pv calculation 
our average natural gas price used in the pv calculation for was per mcf 
this average price during was a decrease from per mcf at year end  compared to per mcf at year end our average oil price used in the pv calculation for was per bbl 
this average price during was an increase from per bbl at year end  compared to in critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements property and equipment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas property and equipment costs 
under this method of accounting  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized including internal costs incurred that are directly related to these activities and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
future development costs are estimated property by property based on current economic conditions and are amortized to expense as our capitalized oil and natural gas property costs are amortized 
we compute the provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties using the unit of production method 
this calculation is done on a country by country basis 
the costs of unproved properties not being amortized are assessed quarterly  on a property by property basis  to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining whether such costs should be impaired  we evaluate current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and gas industry conditions  international economic conditions  capital availability  and available geological and geophysical information 
as these factors may change from period to period  our evaluation of these factors will change 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
the calculation of the provision for dd a requires us to use estimates related to quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimates of unproved properties 
for both reserves estimates see discussion below and the impairment of unproved properties see discussion above  these processes are subjective  and results may change over time based on current information and industry conditions 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties including natural gas processing facilities  capitalized asset retirement obligations  net of related salvage values and deferred income taxes  and excluding the recognized asset retirement obligation liability is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties excluding cash outflows from recognized asset retirement obligations  including future development and abandonment costs of wells to be drilled  using the preceding months average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month  adjusted for price differentials and the effects of hedging  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
we did not have any outstanding derivative instruments at december  that would materially affect this calculation 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
see the discussion above related to reserves estimation 
in  as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices at march   we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and gas properties 
given the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves could continue to change in the near term 
if oil and natural gas prices decline from the prices used in the ceiling test  even if only for a short period  it is reasonably possible that non cash write downs of oil and gas properties would occur in the future 
if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserves volumes  which also reduce our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  non cash write downs of our oil and natural gas properties would occur in the future 
we cannot control and cannot predict what future prices for oil and natural gas will be  thus we cannot estimate the amount or timing of any potential future non cash write down of our oil and natural gas properties if a decrease in oil and or natural gas prices were to occur

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
significant declines in oil and natural gas prices began in the last half of with some improvement in oil prices and high pricing volatility in natural gas through this pricing volatility has continued with natural gas prices while oil prices have seen significant improvement through the current period 
see the business and properties section of this report sensitivity of domestic reserves to pricing 
our price risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options contracts to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
we do not utilize these agreements and financial instruments for trading and only enter into derivative agreements with banks in our credit facility 
price floors at december   we had one oil price floor in effect that covers production of  barrels of oil for january with a strike price of 
interest rate risk 
our senior notes due  and have fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on these notes 
at december   we had no borrowings under our credit facility  which bears a floating rate of interest and therefore is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would not have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows 
income tax carryforwards 
as of december   the company has net tax carryforward assets of million for federal net operating losses  for federal alternative minimum tax credits and million  net of a million valuation allowance  for state tax net operating loss carryforwards which in management s judgment will more likely than not be utilized to offset future taxable earnings 
changes in markets conditions or significant changes in the company s ownership could impact our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and senior notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid or short term nature of these instruments 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair value of our senior notes due  was million  or of face value  and million  or of face value  respectively 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair value of our senior notes due  was million  or of face value and million  or of face value  respectively 
based upon quoted market prices as of december   the fair value of our senior notes due  was million  or of face value 
the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december  and  while the carrying value of our senior notes due was million and million at december  and  respectively  and the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december  customer credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base 
continued volatility in both credit and commodity markets may reduce the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of customers and from certain customers we also obtain letters of credit  parent company guaranties if applicable  and other collateral as considered necessary to reduce risk of loss 
due to availability of other purchasers  we do not believe the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
