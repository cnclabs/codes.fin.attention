item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains certain statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or the future financial performance of biocryst 
such statements are only predictions and the actual events or results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  as well as those discussed in other filings made by biocryst with the securities and exchange commission 
the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report on form k including the disclosures under item a 
risk factors 
cautionary statement the discussion herein contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which are subject to the safe harbor created in section e 
forward looking statements regarding our financial condition and our results of operations that are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states  as well as projections for the future 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
we are subject to risks common to biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our drug discovery  drug development and commercialization efforts  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory actions and marketing approvals  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  competition associated with products  potential competition associated with our drug candidates and retention of key employees 
in order for any of our drug candidates to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us  or our collaborative partners  to conduct clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of the drug candidate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  and obtain market acceptance and adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate significant revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that we will have sufficient funding to meet our future capital requirements 
statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report which are not historical facts are  or may constitute  forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results 
the most significant known risks are discussed in the section entitled risk factors 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
our revenues are difficult to predict and depend on numerous factors  including the prevalence and severity of influenza in regions for which peramivir has received regulatory approval  as well as in those geographies that impact enrollment in our ongoing peramivir clinical trial 
furthermore  revenues related to our collaborative development activities are dependent upon the progress toward and the achievement of developmental milestones by us or our collaborative partners 
our operating expenses are also difficult to predict and depend on several factors 
research and development expenses  drug manufacturing  and clinical research activities  depend on the ongoing requirements of our development programs  availability of capital and direction from regulatory agencies  which are difficult to predict 
management may be able to control the timing and level of research and development and general and administrative expenses  but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of our actions due to contractually committed activities and or payments 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our operating results will be below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in such event  the prevailing market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
overview we are a biotechnology company that designs  optimizes and develops novel drugs that block key enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of diseases 
we focus on therapeutic areas with unmet medical needs that are of interest to us and aligned with our capabilities and expertise 
our areas of interest and related development of drug candidates are determined by the scientific discoveries and the potential advantages that our experienced drug discovery group identifies  as well as by the associated potential commercial opportunity of those discoveries 
we integrate the disciplines of biology  crystallography  medicinal chemistry and computer modeling to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals through the process known as structure guided drug design 
our strategy is to create a sustainable portfolio of commercial products and drug candidates whereby we out license rights to drug candidates in geographies or therapeutic areas where we do not intend to and or do not have the ability commercialize them 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and the policies underlying these estimates on a periodic basis  as situations change and regularly discuss financial events  policies  and issues with members of our audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm 
we routinely evaluate our estimates and policies regarding revenue recognition  administration  inventory and manufacturing  taxes  stock based compensation  research and development  consulting and other expenses and any associated liabilities 
recent corporate highlights peramivir on february   barda hhs awarded us a million contract modification intended to fund completion of the phase development of iv peramivir for the treatment of patients hospitalized with influenza 
this contract modification brings the total award from barda hhs to million and extends the contract term by months through december  the contract  as it currently stands  provides for funding through completion of phase and to support the filing of an nda to seek regulatory approval for iv peramivir in the us through december   approximately million has been recognized as revenue under this contract 
this contract modification supports implementation of our proposed changes to our clinical trial 
significant changes to the clinical trial are as follows modifying the primary efficacy analysis population of the study to focus on a subset of approximately patients not treated with neuraminidase inhibitors as soc  in order to provide the greatest opportunity to demonstrate a statistically significant peramivir treatment effect  increasing the total study target enrollment to approximately subjects from the prior target of subjects  and adding more clinical site locations in geographical regions where neuraminidase inhibitors are not widely used  including sites in india and possibly china 
these changes are expected to increase the amount of time required to complete enrollment in this ongoing study 
the actual time to reach completion of enrollment will depend on the prevalence and severity of influenza  as well as the ability of the more than investigator sites to successfully enroll patients 
in addition  we have agreed with the fda and barda hhs to conduct a planned interim analysis in our clinical trial  which includes a futility assessment 
this analysis is scheduled to be conducted at the earlier of the conclusion of the southern hemisphere flu season or reaching of the current enrollment goal of patients for the primary efficacy analysis population 
if the interim analysis shows an efficacy trend in favor of peramivir  it is expected the clinical trial would continue toward either the current enrollment target or a higher target  depending on the trend 
if  however  the new enrollment target to reach statistical significance is predicted to exceed patients  we would expect to terminate the clinical trial and evaluate the data in hand 
on march   we completed a million non recourse financing transaction designed to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under our license agreement with shionogi  pursuant to which shionogi licensed from us the rights to market peramivir rapiacta in japan and  if approved for commercial sale  taiwan 
we formed royalty sub  a newly created wholly owned subsidiary  which completed a private placement to institutional investors of million in aggregate principal amount of pharma senior secured notes 
this private placement was exempt from registration under the securities act of the pharma notes  which are obligations of royalty sub  are secured by i royalty sub s rights to receive royalty payments from shionogi in respect of commercial sales of rapiacta in japan and  if approved for commercial sale  taiwan  as well as future milestone payments payable by shionogi under the shionogi agreement and all of royalty sub s other assets  and ii a pledge by us of our equity interest in royalty sub 
principal and interest on the pharma notes issued by royalty sub are payable from  and are secured by  the rights to royalty and milestone payments under the shionogi agreement 
principal on the pharma notes is required to be paid in full by the final legal maturity date of december   unless the pharma notes are repaid  redeemed or repurchased earlier 
the pharma notes are redeemable by royalty sub beginning march  and bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable annually in arrears on september st of each year  beginning on september  royalty sub s obligations to pay principal and interest on the pharma notes are obligations solely of royalty sub and are without recourse to any other person  including us  except to the extent of our pledge of our equity interests in royalty sub in support of the pharma notes 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting transaction costs of million and the establishment of a million interest reserve account available to help cover future annual interest shortfalls 
as of december   approximately million remains in the interest reserve account 
in association with the pharma notes  we entered into a currency hedge agreement to hedge certain risks associated with changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar 
under this agreement  we have the right to purchase dollars and sell yen at a rate of yen per dollar for which we may be required to pay a premium in each year from through  provided the currency hedge agreement remains in effect 
a payment of million will be required if  on may of the relevant year  the us dollar is worth yen or less as determined in accordance with the currency hedge agreement 
in conjunction with establishing the currency hedge agreement  we will be required to post collateral to the counterparty  which may cause us to experience additional quarterly volatility in our financial results 
we will not be required at any time to post collateral exceeding the maximum premium payments remaining payable under the currency hedge agreement 
subject to certain obligations we have in connection with the pharma notes  we have the right to terminate the currency hedge agreement with respect to the through period by giving notice to the counterparty prior to may  and paying a million termination fee 
in advance of the may  termination date  we have a limitation on the maximum hedge collateral of approximately million 
the currency hedge agreement does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore mark to market adjustments will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
cumulative mark to market adjustments for the year ended december  resulted in a million hedge loss and we posted million in collateral based on defined thresholds in our operating results will continue to be impacted by mark to market adjustments while the currency hedge agreement remains in effect 
bcx on january   we reported positive long term results from the extension phase of our randomized phase b clinical trial of bcx added to allopurinol in patients with gout who had failed to reach the serum uric acid sua therapeutic goal of mg dl on allopurinol alone 
the results of this week  blinded safety extension confirmed that bcx was generally safe and well tolerated  and sustained sua control over time 
this longer term safety profile of bcx is consistent with the week primary analysis results originally reported in october bcx added to allopurinol was generally safe and well tolerated at all doses studied  and responses to vaccines indicated healthy immune function 
the types and rates of adverse events through weeks  including infections  were similar between the groups treated with bcx and placebo 
no opportunistic or unusual infections were observed 
the safety and efficacy data of bcx at weeks and through weeks is sufficient to undertake end of phase interactions with regulatory authorities in the united states  european union  and japan to obtain guidance on the regulatory requirements to obtain approval to commercialize bcx in those regions 
additionally  both sets of data allow us to continue in out license discussions with potential partners for the continued phase development of the drug candidate and eventual commercialization on a worldwide basis 
we expect these regulatory and out license discussions to occur in  however  we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these discussions or the specific timing thereof 
forodesine on november   we entered into the amended and restated license and development agreement with mundipharma  amending and restating the february  exclusive  royalty bearing development and license agreement for the development and commercialization of forodesine for use in the field of oncology 
under the terms of the amended and restated agreement  mundipharma obtained worldwide rights to forodesine  so they now control the worldwide development and commercialization of forodesine and assume all future development and commercialization costs 
mundipharma also purchased from us certain drug substance for forodesine at a cost of approximately million in december additionally  on november   we further amended our agreements with aecom irl whereby aecom irl agreed to accept a reduction of one half in the percentage of net proceeds as defined received by us under our amended and restated agreement with mundipharma 
the amended and restated agreement is a multiple element arrangement for accounting purposes in which we are required to deliver to mundipharma both the worldwide rights to forodesine and the transfer of product data and know how to permit mundipharma to develop and commercialize forodesine the knowledge transfer 
the world wide license rights were granted to mundipharma upon execution of amended and restated agreement and the knowledge transfer began in the fourth quarter of we expect to complete the knowledge transfer by june  we have accounted for these elements as a combined unit of accounting as neither one has stand alone value to mundipharma 
without completion of the knowledge transfer  mundipharma will not be able to develop and commercialize forodesine in the us amortization of deferred revenue and expense items associated with the initial agreement with mundipharma ceased in november when we were no longer responsible for the development of forodesine 
the unamortized deferred revenue and deferred expense at december  was million and million  respectively  and will be recognized in our statement of operations upon completion of the knowledge transfer 
results of operations year ended december  compared to total revenues decreased to million compared to revenues of million 
revenues in consisted primarily of reimbursement of collaboration expenses from barda hhs with million related to the continued development of iv peramivir and approximately million associated with collaborative revenue amortization from other corporate partnerships 
revenues in consisted primarily of reimbursement of collaboration expenses  including million from barda hhs for the continued development of iv peramivir and the sale of million of peramivir active pharmaceutical ingredient api and other starting materials to shionogi and green cross  as well as a million milestone payment from shionogi related to the marketing and manufacturing approval of rapiacta in japan during the first quarter revenue associated with reimbursement from barda hhs for the continued development of iv peramivir decreased million in as compared to the decrease in revenue associated with our peramivir development program resulted from the completion of two clinical trials in and the realignment of ongoing clinical trials 
in addition  the decrease was also partially related to an estimate revision of prior period expenses for a peramivir clinical trial associated with services performed by a contract research organization cro  and its subsequent revision of service costs in related to a final cost reconciliation 
at the end of  we estimated expenses related to this clinical trial and the associated revenue we expected to receive from barda hhs from estimates provided to us by this cro 
revisions to the estimated costs resulted in a million reduction of peramivir expenses and a million reduction to collaboration revenue during the first quarter of  resulting in a net impact of million to net loss 
research and development r d expenses decreased to million in compared to million for the prior year 
the million decrease was driven by lower development costs associated with our peramivir development program as discussed above and lower costs associated with our forodesine clinical programs 
in connection with the amended and restated agreement with mundipharma  we ceased incurring all forodesine development costs in november and we received million for previously expensed compound development costs 
the decrease in aforementioned costs was partially offset by higher development costs associated with the bcx program for the treatment of gout during additionally  peramivir costs for included million of manufacturing costs associated with peramivir api production for shionogi and green cross 
the following table summarizes our r d expenses for the years ended december   and research and development expenses by program bcx peramivir forodesine other research  preclinical and development costs total research and development expenses research and development expenses include all direct and indirect expenses and are allocated to specific programs at the point of development of a lead drug candidate 
direct expenses are charged directly to the program to which they relate and indirect expenses are allocated based upon internal direct labor hours dedicated to each respective program 
direct expenses consist of compensation for r d personnel and costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  develop manufacturing processes  manufacture the drug candidates  conduct and manage clinical trials  patent related costs  as well as other costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
indirect r d expenses consist of lab supplies and services  facility expenses  depreciation of development equipment and other overhead of our research and development efforts 
r d expenses vary according to the number of programs in clinical development and the stage of development of our clinical programs 
later stage clinical programs tend to cost more than earlier stage programs due to the longer length of time of the clinical trials and the higher number of patients enrolled in these clinical trials 
general and administrative g a expenses decreased to million for from million in the prior year 
the small change reflects timing of expenses between the years associated with the transition of our headquarters to durham  north carolina and cost containment procedures instituted in additionally  we incurred interest expense and losses on our foreign currency derivative during  associated with our million non recourse debt financing transaction completed in march to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments associated with a license agreement with shionogi see note royalty monetization in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we incurred million in interest expense related to our pharma notes and recognized a million mark to market loss related to our currency hedge agreement 
we entered into the foreign currency hedge agreement to hedge changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar 
the currency hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore mark to market adjustments will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
although we cannot predict the future yen dollar exchange rate  we are aware that the applicable foreign currency rates have moved to increase the hedge loss in early  and it is likely that additional cash collateral will be required in the first quarter of we are unable to predict future changes in the yen dollar exchange rate or increases decreases in our hedge loss associated with the currency hedge agreement 
year ended december  compared to total revenues of million consisted primarily of reimbursement of collaboration expenses  including million from barda hhs for the continued development of iv peramivir and the sale of million of peramivir api and other starting materials to shionogi and green cross  as well as a million milestone payment from shionogi related to the marketing and manufacturing approval of rapiacta in japan during full year total revenue of million was significantly impacted by a million product sale of iv peramivir for the treatment of critically ill influenza patients under an eua to barda hhs  and includes million of peramivir development expense reimbursement from barda hhs 
in addition  we recognized less revenue from our collaboration with mundipharma during compared to cost of products sold for the year ended december  was negligible due to the lower amount of product sale as compared to cost of products sold for the year ended december  was approximately million 
included in cost of products sold for the year ended december  is a million provision for peramivir finished goods inventory 
we expense costs related to the production of inventories as research and development expenses in the period incurred until such time it is believed that future economic benefit is expected to be recognized  which generally is reliant upon receipt of regulatory approval 
upon regulatory approval  we capitalize subsequent costs related to the production of inventories 
we determined that the fda s granting of the eua for peramivir in october was objective and persuasive evidence that supported capitalization of peramivir inventories manufactured after the issuance of the eua 
as a result  we recorded manufacturing costs of million for peramivir finished goods inventory 
however  we evaluated whether the costs capitalized as inventory would be recoverable in a future period 
given the lack of objective  reliable evidence to support future demand for peramivir  we concluded that there was no certainty that future sales would materialize and revenues would exceed the costs incurred 
therefore  the capitalized inventory was fully reserved 
research and development expenses increased to million for compared to million for the million increase was primarily due to higher development costs associated with the peramivir and the bcx programs as well as our pre clinical programs 
these increases in r d expenses were partially offset by a decrease in development costs associated with the forodesine program 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for this increase was primarily due to higher consulting fees related to supply chain and other commercial activities  as well as legal fees  operating and personnel related costs 
interest income for was million as compared to million for  due to higher average cash and securities on hand during as compared to the increase in cash and securities primarily resulted from the sale of million shares of common stock in november resulting in net proceeds of million 
liquidity and capital resources cash expenditures have exceeded revenues since our inception and we expect our operating expense to exceed our revenue 
our operations have principally been funded through public offerings and private placements of equity securities  cash from collaborative and other research and development agreements  including government contracts  and to a lesser extent  the pharma notes financing 
on february   we announced that barda hhs had awarded us a million contract modification intended to fund completion of the phase development of iv peramivir  bringing the total award from barda hhs to million and extending the contract term by months through december on march   we completed a million pharma notes financing transaction designed to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under our license agreement with shionogi 
we received net proceeds from this transaction of approximately million 
other sources of funding have included the following other collaborative and other research and development agreements  government grants  equipment lease financing  facility leases  research grants  and interest income 
as of december   we had net working capital of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from approximately million at december  the decrease in working capital was principally due to the funding of our normal operating expenses associated with the development of our drug candidates 
our normal operating expenses were offset in by approximately million of proceeds from the pharma notes net proceeds less cash collateral posted against foreign currency losses and approximately million of net proceeds derived from the sale of approximately  shares of common stock through our at the market financing facility under our form s shelf registration 
our principal sources of liquidity at december  were approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  approximately million in investments considered available for sale  and approximately million in barda hhs receivables 
we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by closely managing our third party costs and headcount  renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with other parties to conduct certain research and development and using consultants 
we expect to incur additional expenses  potentially resulting in significant losses  as we continue to pursue our research and development activities in general  and specifically related to our clinical trial activity 
we also expect to incur substantial expenses related to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims and additional regulatory costs as our clinical products advance through later stages of development 
the objective of our investment policy is to ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds  as well as maintaining liquidity sufficient to meet cash flow requirements 
we place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions  commercial companies  and government agencies in order to limit the amount of our credit exposure 
we have not realized any significant losses on our investments 
during   and  we incurred capital costs of approximately  million  and million  respectively 
at december   we had long term operating lease obligations  which provide for aggregate minimum payments of approximately million in  million in  million in and million in these obligations include the future rental of our operating facilities 
we plan to finance our needs principally from the following payments under our contract with barda hhs  our existing capital resources and interest earned on that capital  payments under collaborative and licensing agreements with corporate partners  and lease or loan financing and future public or private equity financing 
as our clinical programs continue to progress and patient enrollment increases  our costs will increase 
our current and planned clinical trials plus the related development  manufacturing  regulatory approval process requirements and additional personnel resources and testing required for the continuing development of our drug candidates will consume significant capital resources and will increase our expenses 
our expenses  revenues and burn rate could vary significantly depending on many factors  including our ability to raise additional capital  the development progress of our collaborative agreements for our drug candidates  the amount and timing of funding we receive from barda hhs for peramivir  the amount of funding or assistance  if any  we receive from other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the development of our drug candidates  the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most advanced drug candidates  the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead drug candidates and the progression of our other programs 
with the funds available at december  and future amounts that are expected to be received from barda hhs  and our other financing sources  we believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our operations through however  this is a forward looking statement  and there may be changes that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors  including our ability to perform under the contract with barda hhs and receive reimbursement  the progress and magnitude of our research  drug discovery and development programs  changes in existing collaborative relationships or government contracts  our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships with academic institutions  biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies or other third parties  the extent to which our partners  including governmental agencies will share in the costs associated with the development of our programs or run the development programs themselves  our ability to negotiate favorable development and marketing strategic alliances for certain drug candidates  or a decision to build or expand internal development and commercial capabilities  successful commercialization of marketed products by either us or a partner  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to identify and evaluate drug candidates  our ability to engage sites and enroll subjects in our clinical trials  the scope of manufacturing of our drug candidates to support our preclinical research and clinical trials  increases in personnel and related costs to support the development of our drug candidates  the scope of manufacturing of our drug substance and drug products required for future nda filings  competitive and technological advances  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  and the costs involved in all aspects of intellectual property strategy and protection including the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims 
we expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our current drug candidates and we may seek to raise capital at any time we deem market conditions to be favorable 
additional funding  whether through additional sales of equity or debt securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  including governmental agencies in general and from the barda hhs contract specifically  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities  with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
our future working capital requirements  including the need for additional working capital  will be largely determined by the advancement of our portfolio of drug candidates as well as rate of reimbursement by barda hhs of our peramivir expenses 
more specifically  our working capital requirements will be dependent on the number  magnitude  scope and timing of our development programs  regulatory approval of our drug candidates  obtaining and funding from collaborative partners  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  regulatory investigations  and changes in regulatory requirements  the costs of obtaining patent protection for our drug candidates  the timing and terms of business development activities  the rate of technological advances relevant to our operations  the efficiency of manufacturing processes developed on our behalf by third parties  and the level of required administrative support for our daily operations 
financial outlook for based upon planned strategic and development operations  we expect net operating cash usage to be in the range of to million  and expect our total operating expenses to be in the range of to million 
our operating cash forecast excludes any potential cash inflows from out licensing or other sources 
our ability to remain within our operating expense and operating cash target ranges are subject to multiple factors  including unanticipated or additional general development and administrative costs and other factors described under the risk factors located elsewhere in this report 
furthermore  these ranges are highly dependent on peramivir related operating expenses  which are reimbursed by barda hhs 
our peramivir expenses are hard to predict and are largely a function of the rate of enrollment in the our ongoing phase clinical trial  which in turn is dependent on the prevalence and severity of influenza in those geographies where we have enrolling clinical trial sites 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated entities or off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of december  some of the amounts we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations contingent license obligations non recourse notes payable total purchase obligations include commitments related to clinical development  manufacturing and research operations and other purchase commitments 
assumes the pharma notes will be repaid at maturity and the related interest costs will accrue and be paid annually through maturity 
this assumption is based on the unpredictable nature of the royalty payments from shionogi which are designated for both principal and interest payments on the pharma notes 
under the currency hedge agreement  we have the right to purchase dollars and sell yen at a rate of yen per dollar for which we may be required to pay a premium in each year from through  provided the currency hedge agreement is still in effect 
a payment of million will be required if  during the relevant year  the dollar is worth less than yen 
we have the right to terminate the currency hedge agreement with respect to through by giving notice on may  and a payment of a million termination fee 
prior to termination  the maximum amount of hedge collateral we may be required to post is million 
as of december   we have posted million in hedge collateral 
because the posting of additional collateral and payment of annual premiums is contingent on the value of the yen relative to the dollar and other factors  such payments have been excluded from the foregoing table 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future sublicense payments to third parties as part of in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our balance sheet 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which were utilized in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
inventory our inventories consist of peramivir finished goods and supplies for the manufacture of peramivir  which are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out ie  fifo method 
cost includes materials  labor  overhead  shipping and handling costs 
our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and provide valuation reserves for any estimated obsolete  short dated or unmarketable inventories 
in addition  we may experience spoilage of our raw materials and supplies 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
accrued expenses we enter into contractual agreements with third party vendors who provide research and development  manufacturing  and other services in the ordinary course of business 
some of these contracts are subject to milestone based invoicing and services are completed over an extended period of time 
we record liabilities under these contractual commitments when an obligation has been incurred 
this accrual process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to cros in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of our raw materials  drug substance and drug products  and professional fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of these costs  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from collaborative and other research and development arrangements and product sales 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
collaborative and other research and development arrangements and royalties revenue from license fees  royalty payments  event payments  and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement 
fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the products licensed 
in the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables  we evaluate whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting 
revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively 
under certain of our license agreements  we receive royalty payments based upon our licensees net sales of covered products 
generally  under these agreements  we receive royalty reports from our licensees approximately one quarter in arrears  that is  generally in the second month of the quarter after the licensee has sold the royalty bearing product 
we recognize royalty revenues when we can reliably estimate such amounts and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue paid by shionogi on their product sales is subject to returns 
peramivir is a newly introduced product and there is no historical experience that can be used to reasonably estimate product returns 
accordingly  we defer recognition of royalty revenue from shionogi until a right of return no longer exists or until we have developed sufficient historical experience to estimate product returns 
reimbursements received for direct out of pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses 
event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if the event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and the fees are non refundable and non creditable 
any event payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
under the company s contract with barda hhs  revenue is recognized as reimbursable direct and indirect costs are incurred 
product sales product sales are recognized net of estimated allowances  discounts  sales returns  chargebacks and rebates 
product sales recognized during and were not subject to a contractual right of return 
research and development expenses our research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts are recognized as expense when the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
research and development expenses include  among other items  personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  manufacturing costs  clinical  regulatory  and toxicology services performed by cros  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs 
most of our manufacturing and clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party cros 
costs for studies performed by cros are accrued by us over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are adjusted  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of services actually performed 
additionally  we have license agreements with third parties  such as aecom  irl  and uab  which require fees related to sublicense agreements or maintenance fees 
we expense sublicense payments as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred  in which case the expenses are deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period 
we expense maintenance payments as incurred 
at december   we had deferred collaboration expenses of approximately million 
these deferred expenses were sub license payments  paid to our academic partners upon receipt of consideration from various commercial partners  and other consideration to our academic partners for modification to existing license agreements 
these deferred expenses would not have been incurred without receipt of such payments or modifications from our commercial partners and are being expensed in proportion to the related revenue being recognized 
we believe that this accounting treatment appropriately matches expenses with the associated revenue 
we group our r d expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and indirect expenses 
direct expenses consist of compensation for r d personnel and costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the drug candidate  conduct and manage clinical trials  patent related costs  and as well as other costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by program 
indirect expenses consist of lab supplies and services  facility expenses  depreciation of development equipment and other overhead of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
stock based compensation all share based payments  including grants of stock option awards and restricted stock awards  are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and the related assumptions for the model requires judgment  including estimating the life of an award  the stock price volatility  and the expected term 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to value our awards and recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting periods 
the estimation of share based payment awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
significant management judgment is also required in determining estimates of future stock price volatility and forfeitures to be used in the valuation of the options 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
foreign currency hedge in connection with our issuance of the pharma notes  we entered into a foreign currency hedge agreement to hedge certain risks associated with changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar 
under the currency hedge agreement  we have the right to purchase dollars and sell yen at a rate of yen per dollar for which we may be required to pay a premium in each year from through  provided the currency hedge agreement remains in effect 
a payment of million will be required if  on may of the relevant year  the us dollar is worth yen or less as determined in accordance with the currency hedge agreement 
in conjunction with establishing the currency hedge agreement  we will be required to post collateral to the counterparty  which may cause us to experience additional quarterly volatility in our financial results 
we will not be required at any time to post collateral exceeding the maximum premium payments remaining payable under the currency hedge agreements 
in establishing the hedge  we provided initial funds of approximately million to support our potential hedge obligations 
subject to certain obligations we have in connection with the pharma notes  we have the right to terminate the currency hedge agreement with respect to the through period by giving notice to the counterparty prior to may  and payment of a million termination fee 
prior to this termination date  the maximum amount of hedge collateral we may be required to post is million 
the currency hedge agreement does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore mark to market adjustments will be recognized in our statement of operations 
cumulative mark to market adjustments for the year ended december  resulted in a million loss 
mark to market adjustments are determined by quoted prices in markets that are not actively traded and for which significant inputs are observable directly or indirectly  representing the level in the fair value hierarchy as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
the company is also required to post collateral in connection with the mark to market adjustments based on defined thresholds and as of december   million was posted under the agreement 
tax we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against all potential tax assets  due to uncertainties in our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
impact of inflation we do not believe that our operating results have been materially impacted by inflation during the past three years 
however  we cannot be assured that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
we will continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation on the services that we use through improved operating efficiencies and cost containment initiatives

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio and borrowings under our pharma notes 
we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve capital  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions  commercial companies  and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
our investment exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our portfolio  changes in the market value due to changes in interest rates and other market factors as well as the increase or decrease in any realized gains and losses 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities and instruments with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity 
a hypothetical basis point drop in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments to maturity and therefore do not expect that our operating results  financial position or cash flows will be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
however  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or other factors  such as changes in credit risk related to the securities issuers 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs  thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we do not believe that we have material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
generally  our investments are not collateralized 
we have not realized any significant losses from our investments 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
foreign currency risk in connection with the issuance by royalty sub of the pharma notes  we entered into a currency hedge agreement to hedge certain risks associated with changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar 
under the currency hedge agreement  we are required to post collateral based on our potential obligations under the currency hedge agreement as determined by periodic mark to market adjustments 
provided the currency hedge agreement remains in effect  we may be required to pay a premium in the amount of million in each year beginning in may and continuing through may such payment will be required if  in may of the relevant year  the spot rate of exchange for japanese yen us dollars determined in accordance with the currency hedge agreement is such that the us dollar is worth yen or less
