item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development  commercialization and manufacture of proprietary pharmaceutical products  based on our proprietary depofoam drug delivery technology  for use in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers 
on october   the united states food and drug administration  or fda  approved our new drug application  or nda  for our lead product candidate  exparel  a liposome injection of bupivacaine  an amide type local anesthetic  indicated for administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia 
we have developed a sales force entirely dedicated to commercializing exparel comprised of approximately representatives  seven regional managers and a national sales manager 
we have developed this sales force pursuant to a contract with quintiles commercial us  inc  a division of quintiles  inc  or quintiles  and under the terms of this contract we have the flexibility to hire all or a portion of the sales force dedicated to commercializing exparel as full time employees of pacira  upon days notice to quintiles 
we expect to have successfully resolved the commercial manufacturing challenges for exparel to allow product to be commercially available in april  and we believe that our pre launch activities including significant personal interactions with our hospital customers  position us for a successful launch of exparel 
our two marketed products  depocyt e and depodur  and our proprietary depofoam extended release drug delivery technology were acquired as part of the acquisition of ppi california on march   or the acquisition 
depocyt e is a sustained release liposomal formulation of the chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine and is indicated for the intrathecal treatment of lymphomatous meningitis 
depocyt e was granted accelerated approval by the fda in and full approval in depodur is an extended release injectable formulation of morphine indicated for epidural administration for the treatment of pain following major surgery 
depodur was approved by the fda in since inception  we have incurred significant operating losses 
our net loss was million for the year ended december   including research and development expenses of million 
we do not expect our currently marketed products  other than exparel  to generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability because we expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we commercially launch exparel and advance the development of our product candidates  seek fda approval for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials and develop our sales force and marketing capabilities to prepare for their commercial launch 
we also expect to incur additional expenses to add operational  financial and management information systems and personnel  including personnel to support our product development efforts and our obligations as a public reporting company 
for us to become and remain profitable  we believe that we must succeed in commercializing exparel or other product candidates with significant market potential 
recent developments on january   ekr delivered a notice to terminate the licensing  distribution and marketing agreement with us 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the termination of the agreement will be effective days from the date of the notice or july  pursuant to the terms of the agreement the associated supply agreement will also terminate concurrently with the termination of the agreement 
as a result  we expect the supply and royalty revenues from depodur to decrease in the future and we do not intend to re license out the rights to depodur 
license and development agreements in january  we entered into an agreement with novo nordisk a s  or novo  pursuant to which it granted non exclusive rights to novo under certain of its patents and know how to develop  manufacture and commercialize formulations of a novo proprietary drug using the company s depofoam drug delivery technology 
under this agreement  we agreed to undertake specified development and technology transfer activities and to manufacture pre clinical and certain clinical supplies of such depofoam formulated novo product until the completion of such technology transfer activities 
novo is obligated to pay for all costs incurred by us in conducting such development  manufacturing and technology transfer activities 
we are also entitled to 
table of contents receive single digit royalties on sales of such novo product for up to twelve years following the first commercial sale of such novo product 
in addition  we are entitled to receive up to million in milestone payments based on achievement of specified development events  and up to an additional million in milestone payments based on sales of such novo product exceeding specified amounts 
in connection with the novo agreement  we received a one time upfront payment of million in january and a milestone payment of million in november financial operations overview revenues our revenue derived from depocyt e and depodur  our products manufactured by us and sold by our commercial partners  is comprised of two components supply revenue and royalties 
supply revenue is derived from a contractual supply price paid to us by our commercial partners 
royalties are recognized as the product is sold by our commercial partners and are typically calculated as a percentage of the net selling price  which is net of discounts  returns  and allowances incurred by our commercial partners  net of the agreed upon supply price 
accordingly  the primary factors that determine our revenues derived from depocyt e and depodur are the level of orders submitted by our commercial partners  the level of prescription and institutional demand for our products  unit sales prices  the amount of gross to net sales adjustments realized by our commercial partners  and exchange rates on european sales  denominated in euros  that are repatriated in dollars 
we also generate collaborative licensing and development revenue from our collaborations with third parties who seek to use our depofoam technology to develop extended release formulations of their products and product candidates 
we expect the supply and royalty revenues from depodur to decrease in the future due to the upcoming termination of our licensing  distribution and marketing agreement with ekr in july cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of the costs associated with producing our products for our commercial partners and providing research and development services to our collaboration partners 
in particular  our cost of revenues includes manufacturing overhead and fixed costs associated with running two cgmp manufacturing facilities  including salaries and related costs of personnel involved with our manufacturing activities  allocated overhead  personnel conducting research and development  as well as research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants for our collaborative licensing and development activities  royalties due to third parties on our revenues  packaging  testing  freight and shipping  the cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients  and overhead costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity are charged to cost of revenue as incurred 
we expect the cost of revenues to increase in the future due to the classification of exparel manufacturing expenses from research and development expenses to costs of revenues based on the fda approval of exparel on october   and the anticipated commercial launch of exparel in april research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in developing  testing  manufacturing and seeking regulatory approval of exparel and our product candidates  including expenses associated with regulatory submissions  clinical trials and manufacturing  including additional expenses to prepare for the commercial manufacture of exparel  such as the hiring and training of additional personnel  payments to third party contract research organizations  contract laboratories and independent contractors 
table of contents payments made to consultants who perform research and development on our behalf and assist us in the preparation of regulatory filings  personnel related expenses  such as salaries  benefits  travel and other related expenses  including stock based compensation  payments made to third party investigators who perform research and development on our behalf and clinical sites where such research and development is conducted  and facility  maintenance  and allocated rent  utilities  and depreciation and amortization  and other related expenses 
clinical trial expenses for our product candidates are a significant component of our current research and development expenses 
product candidates in later stage clinical development  such as exparel  generally have higher research and development expenses than those in earlier stages of development  primarily due to the increased size and duration of the clinical trials 
we coordinate clinical trials through a number of contracted investigational sites and recognize the associated expense based on a number of factors  including actual and estimated subject enrollment and visits  direct pass through costs and other clinical site fees 
from the acquisition date through december   we incurred research and development expenses of million  of which million is related to the development of exparel 
we expect to incur additional research and development expenses as we accelerate the development of exparel in additional indications 
these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties regarding timing and cost to completion 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time generally varies according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
we are currently unable to determine our future research and development expenses related to exparel because the requirements of any additional clinical trials of exparel for additional indications have yet to be determined 
the cost of clinical development may vary significantly due to factors such as the scope  rate of progress  expense and outcome of our clinical trials and other development activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and other related costs  including stock based compensation  for personnel serving in our executive  finance  accounting  legal  human resource  and sales and marketing functions 
our selling  general and administrative expenses also include facility and related costs not included in research and development expenses and cost of revenues  professional fees for legal  patent expenses  consulting  tax and accounting services  insurance  depreciation and general corporate expenses 
we also include the cost our prospective outcome studies  which are designed for commercial purposes and do not have any regulatory endpoints  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase with the continued development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and increased expenses associated with us operating as a public company 
additionally  in we built a commercial infrastructure for the launch of exparel and we expect our selling costs to increase in the future due to the launch efforts of our commercial organization and our quintiles sales force  which will increase our selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest income expense interest income expense consists of interest income  interest expense  and royalty interest obligation 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and amortization of discount on a note receivable from one of our commercial partners 
interest expense consists primarily of cash and non cash interest costs related to our credit facility  our secured and unsecured notes issued to certain of our investors that converted into common stock upon completion of our initial public offering  and negotiated rent deferral payments 
royalty interest obligation we record our royalty interest obligation as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with asc  sales of future revenues 
we impute interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method 
the effective interest rate may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors including the actual sales of depocyt e and depodur and a significant estimation  performed quarterly  of certain of our future cash flows related to these products during the remaining term of the amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement which terminates on december  the effect of the change in the estimates is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as royalty interest obligation 
in addition  such cash flows are subject to foreign exchange movements related to sales of depocyt e and depodur denominated in currencies other than us dollars 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates we have based our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to clinical trial expenses and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this filing  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and asc  revenue recognition 
we recognize supply revenue from products manufactured and supplied to our commercial partners  when the following four basic revenue recognition criteria under the related accounting guidance are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
prior to the shipment of our manufactured products  we conduct initial product release and stability testing in accordance with cgmp 
our commercial partners can return the products within contracted specified timeframes if the products do not meet the applicable inspection tests 
we estimate our return reserves based on our experience with historical return rates 
historically  our product returns have not been material 
we recognize revenue from royalties based on our commercial partners net sales of products 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms when they can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
our commercial partners are obligated to report their net product sales and the resulting royalty due to us within days from the end of each quarter 
based on historical product sales  royalty receipts and other relevant information  we accrue royalty revenue each quarter and subsequently true up our royalty revenue when we receive royalty reports from our commercial partners 
we recognize revenue from reimbursement received in connection with feasibility studies and development work for third parties who desire to utilize our depofoam extended release drug delivery technology for their products  when our contractual services are performed  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
our principal costs under these agreements include costs for our personnel conducting research and development  and our allocated overhead  as well as research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants 
we recognize revenues from non refundable up front license fees received under collaboration agreements ratably over the performance period as determined under the collaboration agreement estimated development period in the case of development agreements  and contract period or longest patent life in the case of supply and distribution agreements 
if the estimated performance period is subsequently modified  we will modify the period over which the up front license fee is recognized accordingly on a prospective basis 
upon notification of termination of a collaboration agreement  any remaining non refundable license fees received by us  which had been deferred  are recognized over the remaining contractual term 
if the termination is immediate and no additional services are to be performed  the deferred revenue is generally recognized in full 
all such recognized revenues are included in collaborative licensing and development revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments received under collaboration agreements when earned  provided that the milestone event is substantive  its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  we have no further performance obligations relating to the event  and collectability is reasonably assured 
if these criteria are not met  we recognize milestone payments ratably over the remaining period of our performance obligations under the applicable collaboration agreement 

table of contents research and development expenses we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
we rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical studies and to provide services  including data management  statistical analysis and electronic compilation for our clinical trials 
we track and record information regarding third party research and development expenses for each study or trial that we conduct and recognize these expenses based on the estimated progress towards completion at the end of each reporting period 
factors we consider in preparing these estimates include the number of subjects enrolled in studies  milestones achieved and other criteria related to the efforts of our vendors 
historically  any adjustments we have made to these assumptions have not been material 
depending on the timing of payments to vendors and estimated services provided  we may record prepaid or accrued expenses related to these costs 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all stock based payments made to employees and directors based on estimated grant date fair values 
we use the straight line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee s requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our stock based awards to employees and directors using the black scholes option valuation model  or black scholes model 
the black scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility  the calculation of expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  among other inputs 
the following table summarizes our assumptions used in the black scholes model years ended december  expected dividend yield none none none risk free interest rate expected volatility expected life of options years years years expected volatility the expected volatility rate used to value stock option grants is based on volatilities of a peer group of similar companies whose share prices are publicly available 
since our initial public offering  we utilize our available historic volatility data combined with the publicly traded peer s historic volatility to determine expected volatility over the expected option term 
the peer group was developed based on companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry in a similar stage of development 
expected term we elected to utilize the simplified method for plain vanilla options to estimate the expected term of stock option grants 
under this approach  the weighted average expected life is presumed to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate assumption was based on zero coupon us department of the treasury instruments that had terms consistent with the expected term of our stock option grants 
expected dividend yield we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues the following table sets forth a summary of our supply and royalty revenue and collaborative licensing and development revenue for the years ended december   and  including changes as a percentage dollar amounts in thousands versus versus year ended december  increase decrease depocyt e supply revenue royalties depodur supply revenue royalties total depocyt e and depodur supply and royalty revenue collaborative licensing and development revenue total revenues revenues increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to this increase was attributable to a million increase in collaborative licensing and development revenue primarily due to activities performed under the novo agreement  which was signed in january during  we received an up front one time payment of million and a milestone payment of million from novo  which are both deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the expected contract period 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in supply and royalty revenue primarily due to the lower number of depodur lots sold to our commercial partners 
in december  the company was notified of ekr s intent to exit the depodur market 
revenues decreased by million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in collaborative licensing by million due to a reduction in contract development activities for amylin as well as a one time reimbursement of equipment by amylin in this was partially offset by supply and royalty revenue increase of million primarily due to higher sales of depocyt e to our european partner  driven by fulfillment of an order backlog during offset by the foreign exchange rate impact on sales in europe

additionally  the total cost of collaborative licensing and development increased million due to activities performed under the novo agreement 

table of contents total cost of revenues of million  remained consistent in as compared to cost of collaborative licensing and development decreased  as our personnel were re assigned subsequent to the reduction in contract development activities for amylin 
the reduction was offset by an increase in cost of goods sold due to higher volume of depocyt e supply sales and higher cost of maintenance activities 
research and development expenses the following table provides information regarding research and development expenses during the periods indicated  including changes as a percentage dollar amounts in thousands versus versus year ended december  increase decrease research and development research and development expenses decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to a million decrease in third party clinical trials and regulatory costs 
this decrease is related to the close out of our pivotal phase placebo controlled studies in exparel and nda preparation costs in additional cost reductions resulted from the shift in expenses from research and development to cost of revenues upon the approval of exparel in the fourth quarter of this reduction was partially offset by a million increase in compensation costs  including stock based compensation and bonus accrual  which were not present in  and an increase in exparel pre commercial manufacturing related costs 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to this decrease resulted primarily from a million decrease in third party clinical trials costs due to the completion of our pivotal phase placebo controlled studies

the original agreement was entered into prior to the acquisition by the predecessor in order to monetize certain royalty payments from depocyt e and depodur 
in connection with the acquisition  the original agreement with paul capital was amended and restated and the responsibility to pay the royalty interest in product sales of depocyt e and depodur was transferred to us and we were required to make payments to paul capital upon the occurrence of certain events 
to secure our obligations to paul capital  we granted paul capital a security interest in collateral which includes the royalty payments we are entitled to receive with respect to sales of depocyt e and depodur  as well as to bank accounts to which such payments are deposited 
under our arrangement with paul capital  upon the occurrence of certain events  including if we experience a change of control  undergo certain bankruptcy events of us or our subsidiary  transfer any or substantially all of our rights in depocyt e and or depodur  transfer all or substantially all of our assets  breach certain of the covenants  representations or warranties under the amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement  or sales of depocyt e and or depodur are suspended due to an injunction or if we elect to suspend sales of depocyt e and or depodur as a result of a lawsuit filed by certain third parties  paul capital may require us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it at a cash price equal to a of all cumulative payments made by us to paul capital under the amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement during the preceding months  multiplied by b the number of days from the date of paul capital s exercise of such option until december   divided by under the terms of the amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement  our initial public offering did not constitute a change of control 
future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and revenue from product sales  will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditure requirements and service our indebtedness for at least the next months 
however  no assurance can be given that this will be the case  and we may require additional debt or equity financing to meet our working capital requirements 
our need for additional external sources of funds will depend significantly on the level and timing of our sales of exparel 
moreover  changing circumstances may cause us to expend cash significantly faster than we currently anticipate  and we may need to spend more cash than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control 
our expectations regarding future cash requirements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions  mergers  dispositions  joint ventures or investments that we make in the future 
we have no current understandings  agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products  businesses or technologies 
we may need to raise substantial additional capital in order to engage in any of these types of transactions 
we expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses as we commercialize exparel and develop and seek regulatory approval for our other product candidates 
we will incur significant sales and marketing and manufacturing expenses as we prepare to launch exparel in april in addition  we expect to incur additional expenses to add operational  financial and information systems and personnel  including personnel to support our planned product commercialization efforts 
we also expect to incur significant costs to comply with corporate governance  internal controls and similar requirements applicable to us as a public company 
our future use of operating cash and capital requirements will depend on many forward looking factors  including the following our ability to successfully commercialize exparel  the costs of our commercialization activities for exparel  the cost and timing of expanding our manufacturing facilities and purchasing manufacturing and other capital equipment for exparel and our other product candidates  the costs of performing additional clinical trials for exparel  including the pediatric trials required by the fda as a condition of approval  the scope  progress  results and costs of development for additional indications for exparel and for our other product candidates  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our other product candidates  
table of contents the extent to which we acquire or invest in products  businesses and technologies  the extent to which we choose to establish collaboration  co promotion  distribution or other similar agreements for our product candidates  and the costs of preparing  submitting and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property claims 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future operating and capital requirements  we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives 
the covenants under the hercules credit facility and the amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement and the pledge of our assets as collateral limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing 
we have no committed external sources of funds 
additional equity or debt financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies  future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  except for operating leases  or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities
