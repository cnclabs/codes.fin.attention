overview the company designs  develops and markets an array of footwear  apparel and accessories for athletic  high performance sports and fitness activities and casual wear under the k swiss brand 
since july  the company also designs  develops and markets footwear for adventurers for all terrains under the palladium brand 
sales of the palladium brand were approximately of total sales in the categories of footwear we sell are explained in more detail in part i  item  under the subheading  products footwear 
we market our products through company employed sales managers and independent regional sales representatives primarily to a limited number of specialty athletic footwear stores  pro shops  sporting good stores and department stores and also through a number of foreign distributors 
we also sell our products through our website and retail locations  which are becoming increasingly important sales channels to us particularly in light of our limited distribution 
due to the recent global economic crisis  the retail environment has been particularly challenging during the last few years 
while economic conditions began to show signs of improvement beginning in the second half of  the recovery has proceeded at a sluggish rate and the retail environment has remained weak 
further  the current turmoil in the sovereign debt markets as a result of the european debt crisis has resulted in general market uncertainty and in worsening economic conditions in europe 
such conditions have adversely impacted the company s operations in europe  which comprised of our revenues in as a result of these current economic conditions and their impact on the retail environment  business conditions may remain difficult for the foreseeable future 
these conditions combined with the weak demand for the company s product during the past few years could put additional pressure on the company s ability to maintain margins 
further  such conditions have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the company s stock price 
during the latter part of we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization as a result of a decline in our stock price and determined that due to such decline goodwill was impaired 
as such  we recognized an impairment charge of  related to the k swiss brand for our working capital decreased  to  at december  from  at december  the negative cash flow we have sustained has reduced our working capital and continued negative cash flow would materially and negatively affect our ability to fund our operations 
while we have taken and continue to take actions intended to improve our results including implementing a major cost reduction program in which we reduced compensation costs  
table of contents advertising and promotion costs and inventories  the availability of necessary working capital is subject to many factors beyond our control 
such factors include  among others  our ability to obtain additional financing  our ability to increase revenues and to reduce our losses from operations  economic conditions  market acceptance of our products  the intensity of competition in our markets and the level of demand for our products 
in an effort to increase the amount of credit available to us  we have accepted a proposal from a financial institution for a  asset based facility to replace our existing facility 
this asset based facility has a term of four years and bears a variable rate of interest based either upon prime  federal funds or libor 
entry into this new facility remains subject to  among other things  satisfactory due diligence by this financial institution 
if we are unable to secure this facility  reduce our operating losses and significantly reduce our inventories  our liquidity would be impaired 
in  approximately   and of our k swiss brand footwear products were manufactured in china  thailand  vietnam and indonesia  respectively 
in april one of our contract manufacturers  which was one of only three manufacturers utilized by us at that time in our global supply chain  ceased its operations 
while we were able to secure production capacity in new facilities during  we experienced production delays throughout the remainder of and through a portion of  as these facilities gained expertise in producing our product 
at this time  these production delays have been significantly reduced 
although we have no long term manufacturing agreements  we believe that our current relationships with our producers are satisfactory and that we have the ability to develop alternative sources for our footwear 
our operations could  however  be materially and adversely affected if a substantial delay occurred in locating and obtaining alternative producers 
starting in  we began to experience the inflationary pressures of our contract manufacturing in asia  especially in china  with increases in  among other things  labor  raw materials and freight transportation 
as a result of the increase in these product costs  we raised selling prices approximately in the united states for all orders received after may   which mainly affected shipments after november  because we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to our customer  our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of products 
our total revenues increased in from  due to an increase in the volume of footwear sold and an increase in the average underlying wholesale price per pair 
our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in our gross profit margin is mainly due an increase in inventory reserves  greater discounts given to customers due to production delays by our factories  an increase in product costs  an increase in sales of closeout product which has a lower gross profit margin  an increase in reserves against guaranteed minimum royalties and an increase in the provision for unused molds in compared to our overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in as a result of increases in compensation  warehousing and advertising expenses 
other income for consisted of a  settlement agreement between us and one of our international distributors relating to the termination of this distributor s contracts 
the contracts with this distributor were terminated as a result of this distributor not performing in accordance with its contracts  and there was no litigation 
other expense for consists of the recognition of  which represents the net present value of the estimated contingent purchase price cpp for palladium 
at december   our total futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were  a decrease of from the comparable period of the prior year 
of this amount  domestic futures orders were  a decrease of  and international futures orders were  an increase of 

table of contents during the third quarter of  we decided to no longer pursue operating in the form athletics line of business  and accordingly form athletics is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements 
the net loss for was  or per share diluted loss per share  compared to the net loss for of  or per share diluted loss per share 
in  we experienced net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of  net cash provided by investing activities of  mainly due to proceeds from the maturity or sale of investments available for sale and restricted investments available for sale  offset by purchases of investments available for sale and restricted investments available for sale and changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents  and net cash provided by financing activities of  due to an increase in net borrowings on our lines of credit and long term debt  primarily to support inventory growth for strategic initiatives and growth in futures orders in europe  as we can borrow funds in euros which reduces our overall exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we anticipate future cash needs to support our operations to repay borrowings under our third party financing arrangements  which we rely in part upon to support our operations 
as mentioned above  we have accepted a proposal from a financial institution for a  asset based facility to replace our existing facility 
this asset based facility has a term of four years and bears a variable rate of interest based either upon prime  federal funds or libor 
entry into this new facility remains subject to  among other things  satisfactory due diligence by this financial institution 
we anticipate future cash needs to be met with this asset based facility 
at december  and  we had debt outstanding of  and  in attributable to outstanding borrowings by palladium under its lines of credit facilities and term loans  excluding outstanding letters of credit of  and  at december  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  goodwill and intangible assets  sales returns and allowances  and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment 

table of contents in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to the customer according to the terms of the order 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and allowances as reductions to revenues 
we base our estimates on historical rates of returns and allowances and specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
however  actual returns and allowances in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses based on our knowledge of the financial condition of certain customers and historical level of credit losses  as well as an assessment of the overall retail conditions 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from differences that arise from the gross carrying value of our receivables and the amounts which customers estimate are owed to us 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
our allowance for bad debts as a percentage of accounts receivable has remained relatively constant over the past three years despite the weak economy due to our increased scrutiny of customer relationships 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the market value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the market value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record the additional charge to cost of sales 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions and recognize the benefit exposure of those positions if they meet the more likely than not threshold 
any tax position recognized is an adjustment to the effective tax rate 
also  at any point in time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with tax authorities may affect tax positions taken 
additionally  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the geographic mix or level of earnings 
we have not recorded united states income tax expense on earnings of selected foreign subsidiary companies as these are intended to be permanently invested  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as permanently invested is based upon our expectations of the future cash needs of our subsidiaries 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of earnings to be permanently invested 
because the declaration involves 
table of contents our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as permanently invested may ultimately be repatriated 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determine that such amounts were no longer permanently invested 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full calendar year by estimating pre tax income  excluding significant or infrequently occurring items  and tax expense for the remaining quarterly periods of the year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to year to date pre tax income to determine the estimated year to date and quarterly tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the quarterly period in which they occur 
as the year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected annual effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date income tax provision equals the estimated annual rate 
our effective tax rate fluctuates mainly due to our geographic mix of earnings 
in addition  starting january   provision has not been made for united states income taxes on earnings of selected international subsidiary companies as these are intended to be permanently invested 
we evaluate the future realization of our deferred tax assets quarterly 
we review each material tax jurisdiction for which a deferred tax asset has been recorded 
our analysis includes a review of past results  future income  the tax life of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
all evidence is evaluated in forming a conclusion whether a valuation allowance  if any  needs to be recorded 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
we account for the uncertainty in income tax positions and use a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position must meet before recognition in the financial statements 
the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step is a recognition process to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit expense to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit expense that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
any tax position recognized would be an adjustment to the effective tax rate 
we recognize interest expense and penalties on income tax liabilities in income tax expense on our consolidated statement of earnings loss 
we recognize our uncertain tax positions in either accrued income taxes  if determined to be short term  or other liabilities if determined to be long term  on our consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill and intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually  and more often when events indicate that an impairment exists 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment reviews include among other factors  significant changes in business climate  operating results  planned investments  or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment involves the use of estimates relating to the fair values of business operations with which the goodwill is associated and the fair values of intangible assets with indefinite lives 

table of contents we review goodwill for impairment in a two step process 
the first step is to determine whether there is potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  then goodwill is not considered impaired  however  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then step two is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating fair value to all assets and liabilities 
the excess  if any  is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill  then impairment is recognized 
we review intangible assets related to trademarks for impairment  by determining fair value using a relief from royalty payments methodology 
this approach involves two steps i estimating reasonable royalty rates for each trademark and ii applying these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value then impairment is recognized 
determining the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets is highly subjective and requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
we use estimates including estimated future revenues  royalty rates and discount rates  among other factors 
we also consider the following factors the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  changes in consumer demand or acceptance of our brands and products  and other considerations that could affect fair value or otherwise indicate potential impairment 
in addition  facts and circumstances could change  including further deterioration of general economic conditions  customers reducing orders in response to such conditions and increased competition 
these and or other factors could result in changes to the calculation of the fair value which could result in future impairment of the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets 
changes in any one or more of these estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgment about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
form athletics on july   we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement purchase agreement with form athletics  llc form athletics and its members to purchase form athletics for  in cash and additional cash consideration to certain members of form athletics in an amount equal to form athletic s ebitda for the twelve months ended december  form cpp 
form athletics was established in january to design  develop and distribute apparel for mixed martial arts under the form athletics brand worldwide 
the purchase of form athletics was part 
table of contents of an overall strategy to enter the action sports market  however during  we decided to no longer pursue operating in this line of business and recognized impairment losses of  on the form athletics goodwill and trademark and reversed the form cpp liability of  operations of form athletics have been accounted for and presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  the purchase price of  and the net present value of the initial estimate of the form cpp was capitalized 
the fair value of the form cpp was determined each quarter based on the net present value of the current quarter s projection of form athletics ebitda for the twelve months ended december  any subsequent changes to the form cpp was recognized as interest income or interest expense during the applicable quarter the acquisition of form athletics was recorded as a purchase and the form cpp liability was recognized and accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired business were included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
a trademark asset totaling  and goodwill of  were recognized for the amount of the excess purchase price paid over fair market value of the net assets acquired

table of contents compared to revenue and gross profit margin total revenues increased to  in from  in this increase was attributable to an increase in the volume of footwear sold and an increase in the average underlying wholesale price per pair 
the volume of footwear sold increased to  pair in from  pair in the average wholesale price per pair was in and in  an increase of

international revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to in from in k swiss brand revenues increased to  in from  in this increase was the result of increases in the volume of footwear sold and in the average underlying wholesale price per pair 
the volume of footwear sold increased to  pair in from  pair in the average wholesale price per pair was in and in  an increase of  which resulted from the product mix of sales  including a higher percentage of performance product sold in  which generally sell at a higher price than lifestyle product  offset by an increase in percentage of sales of closeout product in we believe the increased revenues were a result of higher than industry standard advertising levels as a percentage of revenues 
palladium brand revenues increased to  in of which were derived from domestic sales compared to  in of which were derived from domestic sales 
the increase in palladium sales in was due to the increase in sales in all regions  including france 
we began marketing and selling palladium product outside of france beginning in the second half of the volume of footwear sold increased to  pair in from  pair in  due to an increase in sales in all regions  as discussed above 
the average underlying wholesale price per pair was in and in  an increase of  resulting from the geographic mix of sales  increase in certain selling prices and decrease in percentage of sales of closeout product in france  which sell at a lower price 
we believe the athletic and casual footwear industry experiences seasonal fluctuations  due to increased sales during certain selling seasons  including easter  back to school and the year end holiday season 
we present full line offerings for the easter season for delivery during the first and second quarters and back to school season for delivery during the third quarter  but only limited offerings for the year end holiday season 
at december   domestic and international futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were approximately  and  respectively  lower and higher  respectively  than such orders were at december  for start ship dates of the comparable period of the prior year 
these orders are not necessarily indicative of revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of future and at once orders can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and the rate of customer order cancellations can also vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the decrease in the domestic futures orders is attributable to the general decline in the k swiss brand and the launch of a new product  the clean classic series  compared to futures orders for tubes product in the prior year  which was a mature product offering 
international futures orders increased primarily due to the increase in european futures orders partially offset by a decrease in futures orders in asia 

table of contents overall gross profit margin  as a percentage of revenues  was in  a decrease from in k swiss brand gross profit margin  as a percentage of revenues  was in  a decrease from in this decrease was largely the result of an increase in inventory reserves  greater discounts given to customers due to production delays by our factories  an increase in product costs discussed further below  an increase in sales of closeout product which has a lower gross profit margin  an increase in reserves against guaranteed minimum royalties and an increase in the provision for unused molds in compared to starting in  we began to experience the inflationary pressures of our contract manufacturing in asia  especially china  with increases in  among other things  labor  raw materials and freight transportation 
as a result of the increase in these product costs  we have raised selling prices approximately in the united states for all orders received after may   which will mainly affect future order shipments after november  palladium brand gross profit margin  as a percentage of revenues  was in  an increase from in the increase in gross margin was a result of the geographic mix of sales  increase in certain selling prices  decrease in closeout product in france  offset by increases in product costs  inventory reserves and provision for unused molds 
our gross margins may not be comparable to some of our competitors as we recognize warehousing costs within selling  general and administrative expenses 
these warehousing costs were  and  for and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  of revenues in from  of revenues in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during was the result of increases in compensation  warehousing and advertising expenses 
compensation expenses  which includes commissions  bonus incentive related expenses and employee recruiting and relocation expenses  increased for as a result of an increase in average headcount from the prior year  severance related expenses and reserve of an employee receivable 
during  average headcount increased as a result of an increase in headcount for the palladium brand on a worldwide basis and increases in headcount especially in asia  where we are expanding our retail operations and also our manufacturing to regions outside of china 
this increase was offset by approximately a reduction in united states and european headcount as a result of cost reduction programs which led to an increase in severance related expenses from the prior year 
other warehousing expenses  which do not include compensation expenses  increased during as a result of increases in freight and transportation costs to customers  rent and storage expenses and third party handling fees as a result of increases in inventories  sales  the number of customers and the volume of shipments to customers 
advertising expenses increased for mainly as a result of strategic efforts to drive revenue in domestic and international markets for the palladium brand 
corporate expenses of  and  for and  respectively  are included in selling  general and administrative expenses and include expenses such as salaries and related expenses for executive management and support departments such as accounting and treasury  information technology and legal which benefit the entire company 
the decrease in corporate expenses for compared to was primarily due to decreases in legal and data processing expenses 
the decrease in legal expenses was a result of decreases in expenses incurred to defend the company s trademarks 
the decrease in data processing expenses was a result of decreases in on going maintenance expense for the company s sap computer software system 
impairment on intangibles and goodwill goodwill impairment of  was recognized on the k swiss brand for during the latter part of we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization due to a decline in

as such  the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying amount of goodwill and it was determined that goodwill was fully impaired 
other income  interest and taxes other income for consisted of a  settlement agreement between us and one of our international distributors relating to the termination of this distributor s contracts 
the contracts with this distributor were terminated as a result of this distributor not performing in accordance with its contracts  and there was no litigation 
the loss of this distributor did not have a significant impact on our revenues or gross margin 
during the fourth quarter of  we secured another distributor for this region 
other expense for consisted of the recognition of  which represented the net present value of the estimated cpp for palladium  as discussed below 
on may   we entered into amendment no 
to the share purchase and shareholders rights agreement with palladium to revise the terms of the remaining future purchase price for palladium payable in pursuant to amendment no 
 the fair value of the future purchase price for palladium  ie the contingent purchase price cpp  will be equal to the net present value of  plus up to  based on an amount calculated in accordance with a formula driven by palladium s ebitda for the twelve months ended december  the  cpp will be determined each quarter based on the current quarter s projection of palladium s ebitda for the twelve months ended december of the current year 
for we recognized the initial fair value of the cpp of  as other expense in the consolidated statement of earnings loss  which represents the net present value of  net interest income was  of revenues and  of revenues for and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest income for was due to lower average balances on cash and investments available for sale and an increase in interest expense on debt  offset by the change in fair value of the palladium cpp and slightly higher interest rates earned on cash  restricted cash and restricted investments available for sale and investments available for sale 
for and  interest expense of  and  respectively  was recognized for the change in the net present value of the cpp 
income tax expense was  for and  for we did not recognize any income tax benefit from options exercised during or as a result of our net loss in each of these years 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets  including net operating losses and tax credits  to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
at december   we had a us income tax receivable of  which is related to a refund for the carryback of the loss to the tax year 
this amount was received in february at december   we had a net deferred tax asset of  which consisted of  for us foreign tax credits which will offset tax in prior taxable years and foreign net operating losses which primarily relate to the pre acquisition losses of palladium  a french company  which has an unlimited carryforward period 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that the us foreign tax credit carryback to the tax year will be recognized and the loss carryforward will be utilized 
the ultimate realization of the loss carryforward is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income outside of the us during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
changes in existing tax 
table of contents laws could also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future operating results 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
at december   gross uncertain tax positions and the related interest  which are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  were  and  respectively  all of which would affect the income tax rate if reversed

we do not agree with this adjustment and plan to vigorously defend our position 
we do not believe that an additional tax accrual is required at this time 
the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
our material tax jurisdiction is the united states 
in january  we received a notice of proposed adjustment for the tax year  which is similar to the one discussed above

impairment on intangibles and goodwill an impairment charge of  on the intangible assets related to the trademarks of the palladium brand was recognized for as a result of the company s annual reassessment of impairment using the relief from royalty payment methodology  which uses current market discount rates and royalty rates 
goodwill impairment of  was also recognized on the palladium brand for as part of its annual reassessment of impairment  the company determined the fair value of the reporting unit using both an income approach ie  discounted cash flow methodology and a market approach ie  guideline public company and guideline transactions methodologies 
as a result of the assessment  primarily based on deteriorating economic market conditions in  it was determined that goodwill was impaired 
these impairment charges are included as corporate expenses for other income  interest and taxes other expense for consists of the recognition of  which represents the net present value of the estimated cpp for palladium  as discussed above 
other expense for includes a loss upon the purchase of the remaining equity interest of palladium of  as discussed below  offset by a gain on the sale of certain assets of the royal elastics brand of  
table of contents on june   we purchased the remaining equity interest in palladium for  or  and recognized a loss of  on the purchase 
the loss was calculated as the difference between the purchase price and the recorded mandatorily redeemable minority interest mrmi 
we acquired the initial equity interest in palladium on july  and the acquisition of palladium was recorded as a purchase acquisition without reflecting any minority interest but recognizing the mrmi liability 
on april   we sold certain royal elastics assets  consisting of its inventory located in taiwan and its intangible trademarks  with an approximate net book value of  to royal elastics holdings ltd 
reh  a third party  in an arm s length transaction for  in respect to this sale  we received a  promissory note from reh and reh agreed to pay us the remaining  in cash by april  as of december   however  we only received approximately  in cash 
the difference between what we expected to receive and what had been received by april  was added to the principal amount of the promissory note balance  such that we hold a promissory note in the principal amount of approximately  from reh

the decrease in net interest income for was a result of lower average balances in cash and investments available for sale as well as lower interest rates  offset by a decrease in the amount recognized for the change in the fair value of the cpp  in interest expense in or mrmi  in interest expense in and a decrease in interest expense on palladium debt 
income tax expense was  for and our income tax benefit was  for we did not recognize any income tax benefit from options exercised during due to our net loss for the year 
the  income tax benefit from options exercised during was credited to additional paid in capital and therefore did not impact the effective tax rate 
during the second quarter of  we moved into a three year pre tax cumulative loss but had sufficient objectively verifiable evidence to demonstrate that our us deferred tax assets would be realized  such as strong earnings history  no evidence of tax losses expiring unused and the end of our aggressive advertising campaign during during the third quarter of  we continued to have the significant weight of the three year pre tax cumulative loss to overcome 
in addition to other significant positive evidence considered in the prior quarter  we decided during the third quarter of to continue with our aggressive advertising campaign into as such  we could no longer rely on a decrease in advertising expenses during to support future profitability sufficient enough to realize our u 
s deferred tax assets in the near future 
therefore  in  we recorded a valuation allowance of  against our deferred tax assets

the changes in inventory during and were due to the timing of sales to customers and purchases from suppliers 
in addition  during there was an overall increase in inventory to support strategic initiatives  including performance product  investing in the growth of the palladium brand and growth in international futures orders 
it is possible that our plans to reduce inventory levels will be less than fully successful  and that such an outcome would result in a change in the inventory reserve in the near term 
the changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities during and were due to the timing of payments to suppliers 
the changes in accounts receivable during and were due to the timing of sales to customers and receipts from customers 
the changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets during and were due to changes in prepaid royalties  endorsements  premiums or discounts on investments available for sale and restricted investments available for sale  forward contracts  prepaid payments to vendors and for  the liquidation of the investment underlying the deferred compensation plan liability 
the changes in impairment of intangibles and goodwill was due to the recognition of impairment during and the changes in income taxes receivable during was due to the recognition of a receivable in which was fully collected in the changes in the deferred income taxes in and is mainly due to the recognition of a tax valuation allowance and timing of items recognized for income tax purposes

we experienced net cash provided by investing activities of  for and net cash used in investing activities of  and  for and  respectively 
the change in net cash from investing activities during was mainly due to changes in purchases of investments available for sale and restricted investments available for sale and proceeds from the maturity or sale of investments available for sale  offset by the change in restricted cash and cash equivalents 
the change in cash from investing activities during was mainly due to an increase in purchases of investments available for sale and restricted investments available for sale and the purchase of form athletics  offset by proceeds from the maturity or sale of investments available for sale and restricted investments available for sale and changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents 
the changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents  purchase of investments available for sale and restricted investments available for sale and proceeds from the maturity or sale of investments available for sale and restricted investments available for sale are partially due to the company s strategy to shift to higher yielding liquid investments or liquidation of investments into cash for operating activities 
we experienced net cash provided by financing activities of  for  net cash used in financing activities of  for and net cash provided by financing activities of  for the change in cash from financing activities during was mainly due to an increase in net borrowings on our bank lines of credit and long term debt  primarily to support inventory growth for strategic initiatives and growth in futures orders in europe  as discussed above  as we can borrow funds in euros which reduces our overall exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the change in cash from financing activities during was mainly due to an increase in net borrowings on palladium lines of credit and long term debt  based on cash needs 

table of contents we anticipate future cash needs for repayments required pursuant to borrowings under our lines of credit facilities and term loans 
in addition  additional funds will be required by our operations if operating results continue to be weak 
no other material capital commitments exist at december  with continued use of our revolving credit facilities as discussed below  we believe our present and currently anticipated sources of capital including asset based financing are sufficient to sustain our anticipated capital needs for however  the negative cash flow we have sustained has reduced our working capital and continued negative cash flow would materially and negatively affect our ability to fund our operations 
while we have taken and continue to take actions intended to improve our results including implementing a major cost reduction program in which we reduced compensation costs  advertising and promotion costs and inventories  the availability of necessary working capital is subject to many factors beyond our control 
such factors include  among others  our ability to obtain additional financing  our ability to increase revenues and to reduce our losses from operations  economic conditions  market acceptance of our products  the intensity of competition in our markets and the level of demand for our products 
our present forecasted operating loss is estimated between  to  there is no assurance that this forecast can be achieved although we have already made significant decreases to operating expenses  as mentioned above  compared to last year and in line with our forecast 
in an effort to increase the amount of credit available to us  we have accepted a proposal from a financial institution for a  asset based facility to replace our existing facility 
this asset based facility has a term of four years and bears a variable rate of interest based either upon prime  federal funds or libor 
entry into this new facility remains subject to  among other things  satisfactory due diligence by this financial institution 
if we are unable to secure this facility  reduce our operating losses and significantly reduce our inventories  our liquidity would be impaired 
in november  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to purchase through december  up to  of the company s class a common stock 
as of december    is remaining in this program 
we adopted the  program because we believed that depending upon the then array of alternatives  repurchasing our shares could be a good use of excess cash 
currently  we have made purchases under all stock repurchase programs from august through february  the day prior to the filing of this form k of million shares at an aggregate cost totaling approximately  at an average price of per share

the interest is at our option at i the bank s prime rate minus percentage points  or ii ibor plus percentage points 
this represents the maturity dates of the current borrowings under the loan agreement 
the loan agreement expires july  
table of contents in january  the company entered into the second amendment with the bank which reduces the amount of availability by any obligations owed for using the bank s treasury or cash management services up to  pursuant to the loan agreement dated as of june   and as subsequently amended to the present date  the bank has agreed to provide us with a revolving line of credit in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed i  minus ii the aggregate amount of borrowings by certain of our foreign subsidiaries the foreign subsidiary borrowers under credit facilities with the bank or any affiliate of the bank such revolving line of credit  the facility plus iii the obligations owed for using the bank s treasury or cash management services up to  with sublimits for letters of credit and bankers acceptances  in each case not to exceed  the facility expires on july   unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement 
at the bank s option  the availability of the facility may be extended beyond july  at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants with the bank 
palladium debt outstanding under its lines of credit and term loans was  and  at december  and  respectively

at december   the amount classified on the consolidated balance sheet as the current portion of long term debt was  which includes accrued interest  and the amount classified as long term debt was interest expense of   and  was incurred on all bank loans and lines of credit during  and  respectively 
in accordance with these financing arrangements with the financial institutions  palladium must meet minimum working capital requirements and is restricted as to the amount of dividends it can pay 
at december   palladium was in compliance with its debt covenants 
see note g to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our working capital decreased  to  at december  from  at december  working capital decreased during mainly due to decreases in investments available for sale and cash and cash equivalents and increases in bank lines of credit  offset by increases in inventory and accounts receivable and a decrease in trade accounts payable 
we have historically maintained higher levels of inventories relative to sales compared to our competitors because we do not ship directly to our major domestic customers from our foreign contract manufacturers to the same extent as our larger competitors  which would reduce inventory 
table of contents levels and increase inventory turns  and unlike many of our competitors  we designate certain shoes as core products whereby we commit to our retail customers that we will carry core products from season to season and  therefore  we attempt to maintain open stock positions on our core products in our distribution facilities to meet at once orders 
contractual obligations at december   our significant contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating lease obligations endorsement obligations royalty obligations bank debt contingent purchase payments product purchase obligations total we generally order product four to five months in advance of sales based primarily on advance futures orders received from customers 
the amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any off balance sheet arrangements during or  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at december  or inflation we believe that distributors of footwear in the higher priced end of the footwear market  including ours  are able to adjust their prices in response to an increase in direct and general and administrative expenses in order to partially or completely offset rising prices  without experiencing a significant loss in sales 
as discussed above in the overview  starting in  we began to experience inflationary pressures of our contract manufacturing in asia  especially china  with increases in  among other things  labor  raw materials and freight transportation 
as a result of the increase in these product costs  we raised selling prices approximately in the united states for all orders received after may   which mainly affect shipments after november  it is unclear whether the increase in prices will sufficiently offset the inflationary pressures and whether such price increases could adversely affect the demand for our product and in turn revenue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposure is the risk of unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro and between the euro and the pound sterling 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management  which reviews and approves our risk management policies 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in foreign exchange rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 

table of contents foreign exchange rate risk sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which are primarily sales to customers in europe  expose us to market risk from material movements in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the foreign currency 
our primary risk exposures are from changes in the rates between the us dollar and the euro and between the euro and the pound sterling 
in and  we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange euros for us dollars and pound sterling for euros 
the extent to which forward foreign exchange contracts are used is modified periodically in response to management s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of specific sales contracts 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and not to engage in currency speculation 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows us to reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash inflow resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers will be materially affected by changes in exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the forward foreign exchange contracts are designated for firmly committed or forecasted sales 
these contracts settle in less than one year 
the forward foreign exchange contracts generally require us to exchange euros for us dollars or pound sterling for euros at maturity  at rates agreed upon at the inception of the contracts 
our counterparties to derivative transactions are major financial institutions with an investment grade or better credit rating  however  we are exposed to credit risk with these institutions 
the credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should these counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
at december   forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of  were outstanding to exchange various currencies with maturities ranging from january to september  to sell the equivalent of approximately  in foreign currencies at contracted rates and to buy approximately  in foreign currencies at contracted rates 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges 
realized losses of  and  for and  respectively  and realized gains of  for from cash flow hedges were recorded in cost of goods sold 
realized losses of  for and realized gains of  and  for and  respectively  from cash flow hedges were recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses due to hedge ineffectiveness 
realized losses of  for from forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments were recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
at december   we did not have any forward foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify as hedges 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our operations or financial position relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in currency rates would not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our short term borrowings on our working capital lines of credit 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company
