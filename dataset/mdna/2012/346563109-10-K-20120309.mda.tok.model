item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we derive revenues from memberships to our research products and services  performing advisory services and consulting projects  and hosting events 
we offer contracts for our research products that are typically 
table of contents renewable annually and payable in advance 
research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
clients purchase advisory services independently and or to supplement their memberships to our research 
billings attributable to advisory services and consulting projects are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
advisory service revenues are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable 
consulting project revenues  which generally are short term in nature and based upon fixed fee agreements  are recognized as the services are provided 
event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event 
our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  including salaries  bonuses  employee benefits and stock based compensation expense for research personnel and all associated editorial  travel  and support services 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  sales commissions  bonuses  employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  travel expenses  promotional costs and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology  operations  finance  and human resources groups and our other administrative functions  including salaries  bonuses  employee benefits  and stock based compensation expense 
overhead costs such as facilities are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group 
deferred revenue  agreement value  client retention  dollar retention and enrichment are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business 
we believe that the amount of deferred revenue  along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services  provide a significant measure of our business activity 
we define these metrics as follows deferred revenue billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date 
agreement value the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time but not including advisory only contracts  without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized 
no single client accounted for more than of agreement value at december  client retention the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve month period that renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period 
dollar retention the percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period 
enrichment the percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve month period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts 

table of contents client retention  dollar retention  and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base 
a summary of our key metrics is as follows dollars in millions as of december  absolute increase decrease percentage increase decrease deferred revenue agreement value client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients as of december  absolute increase percentage increase decrease decrease deferred revenue agreement value client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients deferred revenue and agreement value have increased consistently on an annual basis during and due to increased demand for our products and services as the economy has improved during those periods and as we have increased the number of sales personnel during both and the increase in agreement value during was partially offset by a change in the calculation to exclude agreement value in excess of the first year for multiple year contracts signed in and beyond  which reduced the growth rate in by approximately 
client retention  dollar retention  enrichment  and the number of clients have all increased from levels  which is consistent with an improved economic environment  and our retention metrics are near historic highs at december  critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates  including but not limited to  those related to our revenue recognition  stock based compensation  non marketable investments  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  and valuation and impairment of marketable investments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  data available at the time the estimates are made and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or that involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
this is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment 
table of contents in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f revenue recognition 
effective january  we adopted update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
asu updates the previous multiple element revenue arrangements guidance 
the revised guidance primarily provides three significant changes it eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  it eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration  and it modifies the fair value requirements of eitf issue by providing best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and vendor objective evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we generate revenues from licensing memberships to our research including our data products  performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events 
we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  services have been provided to the customer  and collectability is reasonably assured 
our contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and services 
revenues from contracts that contain multiple products or services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices  however  the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions 
for example  when a discount off of list price is provided in a multiple element contract  the discount is applied ratably to the research and data products only which commence delivery on the first day of the contract  as the undelivered products in the contract advisory services or events would be refundable to the customer at list price 
we obtain the selling prices of our products and services based upon an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year 
research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
advisory service revenues are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
reimbursed out of pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services revenue 
event revenues are recognized upon completion of the event 
annual subscriptions to our roleview research include access to all or a designated portion of our research  and depending on the type of license  membership in one or more of our forrester leadership boards  unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry  unlimited participation in forrester teleconferences  and the right to attend one event 
contracts for roleview research entered into prior to the adoption of asu on january   were accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period 
contracts for roleview research entered into or significantly modified after january  are accounted for as two units of accounting the event ticket and the remaining research services that are delivered throughout the contract period based on the new guidance that permits alternative methods of determining selling prices as it relates to the components that we do not sell on a standalone basis  such as research services in our case 
arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based upon its relative selling price  which is determined based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining research services 
annual subscriptions to our data products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data specialist  which are delivered throughout the year  and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period 
we offer our clients a service guarantee  which gives our clients the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services 
furthermore  our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses  as commissions are earned during the month a contract is booked and are deferred and recognized as expense as the related revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation is recognized as an expense based upon the fair value of the award at the time of grant 
the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation 
table of contents requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility  expected option lives and forfeiture rates 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
expected volatility is based  in part  on the historical volatility of our common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted 
the development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting dates and stock option exercise dates 
we are also required to estimate future forfeitures of stock based awards for recognition of compensation expense 
we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
in addition  for our performance vested restricted stock units  we make estimates of the performance outcome at each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned 
the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate or performance outcomes are materially different from our estimates  or if our estimates of forfeitures or performance outcomes are modified in a future period  the actual stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
for example  during we modified our estimates of the performance outcome for rsus issued during and that resulted in a credit of million being recorded in related to expense recognized in prior periods related to these rsus 
non marketable investments 
we hold minority interests in technology related investment funds with a book value of million at december  these investment funds are not publicly traded  and  therefore  because no established market for these securities exists  the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment 
investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other than temporary impairment in their value occurs 
for investments that are accounted for using the equity method  we record our share of the investee s operating results each period 
we review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other than temporary impairment in the investment has occurred 
we record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
as of december   we had million of goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if an impairment exists  we compare each of our reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value 
determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates of market conditions and operational performance 
absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist  we have selected november as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test 
we completed the annual goodwill impairment testing as of november  and concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer relationships  technology  research content  and trademarks  and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce 
these assigned values are amortized on a basis which best matches the periods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized 
tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment  which are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible and long lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
to compute whether intangible assets have been impaired  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
table of contents for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards from acquisitions 
such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
as a global company  we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and record a liability based on the probability for such outcomes in accordance with current accounting guidelines 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns  and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
valuation and impairment of marketable investments 
our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in us treasury and us government agency securities  taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes some of which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper and money market funds 
the assessment of the fair value of certain of the debt securities eg those containing an auction reset feature can be difficult and subjective due in part to limited trading activity of certain of these debt instruments 
in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements  we have classified our marketable investments as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets  quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points 
as of december   we held municipal bonds with a fair value of million million at par value with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars 
the fair value of the ars was determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow approach  which is considered a level valuation 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates  based on data available at december   of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
the assumptions used in valuing the ars are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  which may lead us in the future to record additional losses for these securities 
we classified these ars as available for sale securities and determined that the losses were not considered other than temporary and were not due to credit losses 
accordingly  changes in the market value of the ars have been recorded in other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets for the years ended december  and if market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record unrealized losses in other comprehensive loss or impairment charges within the consolidated statements of income 
we may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security  a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the security matures 

table of contents at december   we held million of marketable investments that were valued using level inputs 
level investments are initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued  at the end of each reporting period  by our investment managers utilizing third party pricing services  which consists of one price per instrument 
we do not obtain pricing or quotes from brokers directly and historically we have not adjusted prices obtained from our investment managers for our non ars portfolio 
we verify the pricing information obtained from our investment managers by obtaining an understanding of the pricing methodology and inputs utilized by the pricing services to value our particular investments  as well as an understanding of the controls and procedures utilized by our investment managers to both ensure the accurate recording and to validate the pricing of our investments obtained from the pricing services on an annual basis 
our marketable investments consist solely of high credit quality corporate and municipal bonds with a weighted average credit rating aa and do not include difficult to value features 
the majority of our marketable investments are in large corporate notes 
we conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss  in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  as required under current accounting standards 
an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis 
unrealized losses on available for sale securities that are determined to be temporary  and not related to credit loss  are recorded  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
for available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses  management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value would be deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss would be recorded within gains losses on investments  net in the consolidated statements of income 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and are recorded within gains losses on investments  net in the consolidated statements of income

memberships for research services  which constituted approximately of our revenues during  are annually renewable and are generally payable in advance 
we generated cash from operating activities of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided from operations in compared to is primarily attributable to both a reduction in the amount of income taxes paid during of million  primarily due to a deferral of payments  and to an increase in net income of million 
the decrease in cash provided from operations in compared to is primarily attributable a lower amount of cash generated from working capital in of million compared to million in during we used million of cash from investing activities  consisting primarily of million of net purchases of marketable investments  million of purchases of property and equipment and million for acquisitions 
the property and equipment purchases were partially funded by million of restricted cash that had been placed in escrow in for such purchases 
property and equipment purchases during consisted primarily of leasehold improvements for new facilities and also included purchases of software and computer equipment 
during  we generated million of cash from investing activities  consisting primarily of million of proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable investments  which was partially offset by million of property and equipment purchases 
property and equipment purchases in primarily consisted of leasehold improvements for new facilities as well as purchases of software and computer equipment 
we expect property and equipment purchases to be in a range of million to million in we used million of cash from financing activities during resulting from million of purchases of our common stock  partially offset by million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization and we plan to continue to repurchase our common stock during  as market conditions warrant 
during  we used million of cash in financing activities as we paid a special cash dividend in december of million  which represented a payment of per share to our common stockholders 
also in  we used million for purchases of our common stock and received million from proceeds and related tax benefits from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
in february our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share payable on march  we intend to begin paying regular quarterly cash dividends  however  the actual declaration of any such future dividends  and the establishment of the per share amount and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to the discretion of the board of directors 
as of december   we held million million at par value of municipal bonds with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars 
in february  auctions began to fail for these 
table of contents securities and have continued to fail throughout as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or may not exist 
based on our expected operating cash flows and our cash resources  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity with our ars investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable investments of million 
cash balances held at our foreign subsidiaries were million at december   of which million represents undistributed earnings that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested 
we do not have a line of credit and do not presently anticipate the need to access a line of credit in the foreseeable future 
we believe that our current cash balance  marketable investments  and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities  and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years 
as of december   we had future contractual obligations as follows contractual obligations total thereafter in thousands operating leases off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet financing arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we have historically not used derivative financial instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable investments in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  municipal notes and bonds  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
the securities  other than money market funds  are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
at december   we held approximately million million at par value of municipal notes with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars 
in february  auctions for these securities began to fail and continued to fail throughout these ars may not be accessible for in excess of twelve months because of continued failed auctions and have been classified in the consolidated balance sheets as long term marketable securities as of december  based on current market conditions  it is likely that auction failures will continue and as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or may not exist 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments
