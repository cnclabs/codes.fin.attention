see forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the historical performance of our business  its financial condition and its prospects 
we will discuss and provide our analysis of the following overview of business  business segments  results of operations and related information  liquidity and capital resources  adoption of new accounting pronouncements  and critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

table of contents overview of business we are a leading producer of technical products and premium fine papers 
we have two primary operations our technical products business and our fine paper business 
our mission is to create value by improving the image and performance of everything we touch 
we expect to create value by expanding our presence in growing technical products markets  while delivering attractive returns from our fine paper business 
in managing our businesses  we believe that achieving and maintaining a leadership position in our markets  responding effectively to customer needs and competitive challenges  employing capital optimally  controlling costs and managing risks are important to long term success 
changes in input costs and general economic conditions also impact our results 
in this discussion and analysis  we will refer to these factors 
increase the size of our technical products business technical products are expected to represent an increasing proportion of our consolidated results in the future as we pursue growth in faster growing  profitable markets outside of north america and europe by following our global customers to expand internationally and enter into attractive market adjacencies 
growth is likely to occur both organically and through selective acquisitions 
maintain our leading position and attractive returns in fine paper we expect to maintain our attractive returns in fine paper as we continue to gain share as leaders in the north american premium fine paper market through continued support of our market leading brands  recognized supply chain capabilities and diligent management of costs 
we will also focus on expanding into new areas that can support growth such as premium labels  luxury packaging  retail channel stores and international markets 
competitive environment our past results have been and our future prospects will be significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
in most of our markets  our businesses compete directly with well known competitors  some of which are larger and more diversified 
while our businesses are oriented to premium performance and quality they may also face competitive pressures from lower value products 
economic condition and input costs the markets for all of our products are affected to a significant degree by economic conditions  including rapid changes in input costs  particularly for pulp  latex and natural gas 
our results are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly for the euro 
business segments our technical products business is a leading international producer of transportation and other filter media and durable  saturated and coated substrates for a variety of end markets 
we focus on categories where we believe we are  or can be  a market leader  which include  among others  the transportation and other filtration media  tape  abrasive  nonwoven wall coverings  label  medical packaging and image transfer technical products markets 
our technical products manufacturing facilities are located near munich and frankfurt  germany and in munising  michigan 
premium fine papers represent approximately two and a half to three percent of the north american uncoated free sheet market 
we believe our fine paper business is the leading supplier of premium writing  text and cover papers  bright papers and specialty papers in north america 
our products include some of the most recognized and preferred papers in north america  where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories 
we sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors  converters and specialty businesses 
we believe that our fine paper manufacturing facilities located in appleton  neenah and whiting  wisconsin are among the most efficient for their markets and make us one of the lowest cost producers in the product categories in which we compete 
results of operations and related information in this section  we discuss and analyze our net sales  income before interest and income taxes which we refer to as operating income in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other information relevant to an understanding of our results of operations 

table of contents executive summary operating results for the year ended december  benefited from higher selling prices  an improved mix of products sold and cost efficiencies  including reduced selling general and administrative sg a expense 
these favorable factors were partially offset by higher input costs  primarily for latex  pulp and energy 
over time  our businesses have been able to offset the increase in input costs through a combination of higher selling prices  a more favorable product mix and cost control efforts 
there can be no assurance  however  that these efforts will be successful in the future 
for the year ended december   consolidated net sales increased approximately million from the prior year period to million 
excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  net sales increased million primarily due to increased selling prices  an improved product mix and higher technical products volume 
consolidated operating income of million for the year ended december  increased million from the prior year 
excluding costs related to the early redemption in and a gain related to the sale of the ripon mill in  consolidated operating income increased million from the prior year due to higher average net price and the benefits of cost control initiatives  partially offset by increased manufacturing input costs and lower fine paper volume

net sales in our technical products business increased million  or percent  primarily due to higher average net prices and favorable currency exchange effects 
the higher average net prices reflected a three percent increase in average selling prices and a more favorable product mix due to growth in premium filtration  labels and medical packaging products 
favorable currency exchange effects reflected a five percent strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar during shipment volumes increased approximately one percent from the prior year primarily due to strong growth in transportation filtration  wall covering  medical packaging products and label shipments 

table of contents net sales in our fine paper business increased million  or approximately one percent  due to higher average net selling prices partially offset by a six percent decrease in shipment volume 
average net price was more than two percent higher than the prior year due to higher average selling prices and a more favorable product mix 
the lower shipment volume was primarily due to a general decline in shipments for the premium fine paper market and a reduction in lower value special make sales in the general decline in shipment volume due to market conditions was partially offset by increased revenue from a program that allows customers to coordinate envelope orders with their other paper needs and strong growth in luxury packaging and premium label shipments 
year versus change in net sales compared to the prior year for the year ended december  change due to total change average net price volume currency technical products fine paper consolidated consolidated net sales of million for the year ended december  were million higher than the prior year primarily due to increased volume in both segments which benefited from improved market conditions and our direct customers replenishing the supply chain

net sales in our technical products business of million increased million or percent primarily due to an percent increase in shipments 
higher sales volume reflected strong growth in transportation filter media  abrasive backing  wall covering and tape shipments 
average net selling prices increased due to a more favorable product mix and a two percent improvement in average selling prices 
these favorable variances were partially offset by an million decrease in sales due to a weakening of exchange rates for the euro versus the us dollar 
net sales in our fine paper business of million increased million or seven percent due to a five percent increase in shipments and higher average net selling prices 
the improved sales volume reflected higher shipments of both premium and value specialty papers  as well as non branded products 
in addition  we benefitted from increased export sales to markets outside north america and strong growth in label  packaging and envelope shipments which in the aggregate grew by more than percent in we believe that we were able to improve our market share position based on the american forestry and paper associations report of a six percent year over year industry decline in the premium writing  text and cover uncoated free sheet paper category 
average selling prices were approximately four percent higher than the prior year primarily as a result of pricing actions implemented in the second half of and throughout for both branded and non branded products 
higher average selling prices were partially offset by a less favorable sales mix which reflected higher growth rates for lower priced products relative to our branded products 

table of contents analysis of operating income years ended december   and the following table sets forth line items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated and is intended to provide a perspective of trends in our historical results year ended december  net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses other income net loss on retirement of bonds loss gain on closure and sale of the ripon mill operating income interest expense net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations the following table sets forth our operating income by segment for the periods indicated year ended december  operating income technical products fine paper unallocated corporate costs consolidated operating income as reported adjustments for unusual items fine paper adjustments loss gain on closure and sale of the ripon mill unallocated corporate costs adjustment loss on retirement of bonds consolidated operating income as adjusted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  consolidated operating income includes the pre tax effects of unusual items 
we believe that by adjusting reported operating income to exclude the effects of these items  the resulting adjusted operating income is on a basis that reflects the results of our ongoing operations 
we believe that providing adjusted operating results will help investors gain an additional perspective of underlying business trends and results 
adjusted operating income is not a recognized term under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income derived in accordance with gaap 
other companies may use different methodologies for calculating their non gaap financial measures and  accordingly  our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to their measures

adoption of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
asu no 
which amends asc topic  comprehensive income 
asu topic no 
gives an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in each instance  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu no 
eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
asu no 
does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
asu no 
which supersede certain pending paragraphs in asu no 
to effectively defer only those changes in asu no 
that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we adopted asu no 
and asu no 
in our annual financial statements for the year ended december  the adoption of asu no 
and asu no 
did not affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
which amends asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment asc topic 
asu topic no 
gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  as described in asc topic if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under asu no 
 an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
under asu no 
 an entity no longer is permitted to carry forward its detailed calculation of a reporting unit s fair value from a prior year as previously permitted by asc topic asu no 
does not change the current guidance for testing other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu no 
is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued 
we adopted asu no 
in our annual financial statements for the year ended december  the adoption of asu no 
did not affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regard to estimates used 
these critical judgments relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of expenses 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of our financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
inventories we value us inventories at the lower of cost  using the last in  first out lifo method for financial reporting purposes  or market 
german inventories are valued at the lower of cost  using a weighted average cost method  or market 
the first in  first out value of us inventories valued on the lifo method was million and million at december  and  respectively and exceeded such lifo value by million and million  respectively 
cost includes labor  materials and production overhead 
income taxes as of december   we have recorded aggregate deferred income tax assets of million related to temporary differences  net operating losses and credits 
we have established a valuation allowance of million against certain state deferred income tax assets in states where we no longer have operations 
as of december   our aggregate deferred income tax assets were million and had a valuation allowance against such deferred income tax assets of million 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we consider many factors  including specific taxing jurisdictions  sources of taxable income  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction 
a valuation allowance would be recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents as of december  and  our liability for uncertain income taxes positions was million and million  respectively 
in evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits  we consider many factors which may result in periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
pension and other postretirement benefits pension plans substantially all active employees of our us operations participate in defined benefit pension plans and or defined contribution retirement plans 
neenah germany has defined benefit plans designed to provide a monthly pension benefit upon retirement to substantially all of its employees in germany 
in addition  we maintain a supplemental retirement contribution plan the serp which is a non qualified defined benefit plan 
we provide benefits under the serp to the extent necessary to fulfill the intent of our defined benefit retirement plans without regard to the limitations set by the irs on qualified defined benefit plans 
our funding policy for qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation  as required by the pension protection act of subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits  any funding shortfall is to be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 
nonqualified plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the taxing authorities are not funded 
there is no legal or governmental obligation to fund neenah germany s benefit plans and as such the plans are currently unfunded 
consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets held by our pension trusts was determined based on several factors  including input from pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered the plans historical year and year compounded annual returns 
we anticipate that  on average  actively managed us pension plan assets will generate annual long term rates of return of at least percent 
our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about percent with equity managers  with expected long term rates of return of approximately to percent  and percent with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of approximately to percent 
the actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
we evaluate our investment strategy and long term rate of return on pension asset assumptions at least annually 
pension expense is estimated based on the fair value of assets rather than a market related value that averages gains and losses over a period of years 
investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of the assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
the variance between the actual and the expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a market related value for plan assets was used 
as of december   our pension plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately million 
these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns  ii other factors  including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains  including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under asc topic the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in the us is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of aa rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place  whose duration matches the timing of expected pension benefit payments 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in germany is generally based on the iboxx index of aa rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected pension benefit payments 
the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the present value of future pension obligations at december  and was percent and percent  respectively 
our consolidated pension expense in is based on the expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets and the weighted average discount rate described above and various other assumptions 
pension expense beyond will depend on future investment performance  our contributions to the pension trusts  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

table of contents the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans at december  of approximately million increased approximately million from the fair value of about million at december   as investment gains and employer contributions exceeded benefit payments 
at december   the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million which was approximately million larger than the million deficit at december  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
contributions to pension trusts for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december  in addition  we made direct benefit payments for unfunded qualified and supplemental retirement benefits of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other postretirement benefit plans we maintain postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans for active employees and former employees of our canadian pulp operations 
the plans are generally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire on or before december  and contributory for most employees who became eligible to retire on or after january  we do not provide a subsidized postretirement health care or life insurance benefit to most employees hired after our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans are unfunded 
for the years ended december   and  consolidated postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit expense was million  million and million  respectively 
the weighted average discount or settlement rate used to calculate postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit expense was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit obligations in the us is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of aa rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place  whose duration matches the timing of expected postretirement health care and life insurance benefit payments 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future postretirement health care and life insurance obligations for our foreign benefit plans is generally based on an index of aa rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected benefit payments 
our consolidated postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit expense in is based on the weighted average discount rate described above and various other assumptions 
postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit expense beyond will depend on future health care cost trends  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 
our obligations for postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefits are measured annually as of december the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the present value of future postretirement health care and life insurance obligations at december  and was percent and percent  respectively 
the assumed inflationary health care cost trend rates used to determine obligations at december  and costs for the year ended december  were percent gradually decreasing to an ultimate rate of percent in the assumed inflationary health care cost trend rates used to determine obligations at december  and costs for the year ended december  were percent gradually decreasing to an ultimate rate of percent in at december   the projected benefit obligations for our postretirement health care and life insurance plans was approximately million and was essentially unchanged from the projected benefit obligation at december  
table of contents impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with asc topic  property  plant  and equipment asc topic  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pre tax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pre tax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique using multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill arising from a business combination is recorded as the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with asc topic  business combinations asc topic 
all of our goodwill was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of neenah germany in october under asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
asc topic provides an entity with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if the two step impairment test is necessary  a fair value based test is applied at the reporting unit level  which is generally one level below the operating segment level 
the test compares the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
this test requires various judgments and estimates 
the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using a market approach in combination with a discounted operating cash flow approach 
impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the fair values of recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
an adjustment to goodwill will be recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually on november in conjunction with preparation of its annual business plan  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
at november   the company s assessment of qualitative facts and circumstances indicated no impairment of goodwill 
the qualitative factors that we considered included  but were not limited to  changes in the macroeconomic conditions  changes in industry and market conditions such as an increase in the competitive environment  changes in manufacturing input costs particularly to the extent these cannot be recovered through higher prices  changes in our market capitalization and changes in financial performance including earnings and cash flows 
certain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not amortized 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are annually reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic 
table of contents our annual test of goodwill for impairment at november   and indicated that the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to neenah germany was considered recoverable 
significant assumptions used in developing the discounted operating cash flow approach were revenue growth rates and pricing  costs for manufacturing inputs  levels of capital investment and estimated cost of capital for high  medium and low growth environments 
as of december   a one percentage point increase in the estimate for our cost of capital used in the impairment test would result in an approximately million change in the estimated fair value of the neenah germany but would not result in an impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets with finite lives acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships  trade names and acquired intellectual property 
such intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of between and years 
our annual test of other intangible assets for impairment at november   and indicated that the carrying amount of such assets was recoverable 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc topic 
the amount of stock based compensation cost recognized is based on the fair value of grants that are ultimately expected to vest and is recognized pro rata over the requisite service period for the entire award 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to risks such as changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and environmental regulation 
a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading 
presented below is a description of our most significant risks 
foreign currency risk our reported operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rates of the local currencies of our non us operations relative to the us dollar 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical percent increase in the exchange rates of the u 
s dollar relative to the local currencies of our non us operations would have decreased our income before income taxes by approximately million 
we do not hedge our exposure to exchange risk on reported operating results 
the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations from their local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar 
consequently  we performed a sensitivity test to determine if changes in the exchange rate would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations into non us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of our non us operations by a percent change in the exchange rate of their local currencies versus the us dollar 
as of december   the net assets of our non us operations exceeded their net liabilities by approximately million 
as of december   a percent decrease in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the local currencies of our non us operations would have decreased our stockholders equity by approximately million 

table of contents commodity risk pulp we purchase the wood pulp used to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over the price paid for our wood pulp purchases 
therefore  an increase in wood pulp prices could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
based on pulp purchases  a percent increase in the average market price for pulp approximately per ton would have increased our annual costs for pulp purchases by approximately million 
other manufacturing inputs we purchase a substantial portion of the other manufacturing inputs necessary to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over our costs for such manufacturing inputs 
therefore  an increase in other manufacturing inputs could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our technical products business acquires all of its specialized pulp requirements from two global suppliers and certain critical specialty latex grades from four suppliers 
in general  these supply arrangements are not covered by formal contracts  but represent multi year business relationships that have historically been sufficient to meet our needs 
we expect these relationships to continue to operate in a satisfactory manner in the future 
in the event of an interruption of production at any one supplier  we believe that each of these suppliers individually would be able to satisfy our short term requirements for specialized pulp or specialty latex 
in the event of a long term disruption in our supply of specialized pulp or specialty latex  we believe we would be able to substitute other pulp grades or other latex grades that would allow us to meet required product performance characteristics and incur only a limited disruption in our production 
as a result  we do not believe that the substitution of such alternative pulp or latex grades would have a material effect on our operations 
our fine paper business acquires a substantial majority of the cotton fiber used in the production of certain branded bond paper products pursuant to annual agreements with two north american producers 
the balance of our cotton fiber requirements are acquired through spot market purchases from a variety of other producers 
we believe that a partial or total disruption in the production of cotton fibers at our two primary suppliers would increase our reliance on spot market purchases with a likely corresponding increase in cost 
since cotton fiber represents less than five percent of the total fiber requirements of our fine paper business and we have the ability to source cotton fiber on the spot market if faced with a supply disruption  we would not expect cotton fiber supply issues to have a material effect on our operations 
we generate substantially all of the electrical energy used by our munising mill and approximately percent and percent of the electrical energy at our appleton and bruckm hl mills  respectively 
availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future  but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on fluctuations in demand and other factors 
there is no assurance that that we will be able to obtain electricity or natural gas purchases on favorable terms in the future 
except for certain specialty latex grades and specialty softwood pulp used by our technical products business and cotton fiber used by our fine paper business  we are not aware of any significant concentration of business transacted with a particular supplier 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate bank debt 
at december   we had million of variable rate borrowings outstanding 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate borrowings by approximately million 

table of contents environmental regulation climate change legislation our manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation primarily by us  german and other international authorities 
we have made significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
due to changes in environmental laws and regulations  including potential future legislation to limit ghg emissions  the application of such regulations and changes in environmental control technology  we are not able to predict with certainty the amount of future capital spending to be incurred for environmental purposes 
taking these uncertainties into account  we have planned capital expenditures for environmental projects during the period through of approximately million to million annually 
we believe these risks can be managed and will not have a material effect on our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
