critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the areas that require significant judgment are as follows 
revenue recognition the company generates revenue from software license sales and related services  including maintenance and support  hosting  and consulting and implementation services 
the company licenses its products to end user customers  including corporate legal and it departments  law firms  independent software vendors isvs  international distributors and value added resellers vars 
the company s products are generally sold with a perpetual license 
the company s contracts with isvs  vars and international distributors do not include special considerations such as rights of return  stock rotation  price protection or special acceptance 
the company exercises judgment in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
the nature of each contractual arrangement determines how revenues and related costs are recognized 
for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software  revenue is recognized when the software product or service has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fees are fixed and determinable  uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved  collectability is probable and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
for fixed price arrangements that require significant modification or customization of software  the company uses the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition 
under the percentage of completion method  progress towards completion is generally measured by labor hours 
the company considers a signed non cancelable license agreement  a customer purchase order  a customer purchase requisition  or a sales quotation signed by an authorized purchaser of the customer to be persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists such that revenue can be recognized 
the company s customer contracts may include multi element arrangements that include a delivered element a software license and undelivered elements such as maintenance and support and or consulting 
the value allocated to the undelivered elements is unbundled from the delivered element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the maintenance and support and or consulting  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract 
vsoe of fair value is defined as i the price charged when the same element is sold separately  or ii if the element has not yet been sold separately  the price for the element established by management having the relevant authority when it is probable that the price will not change before the introduction of the element into the marketplace 
the company then allocates the remaining balance to the delivered element a software license regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract using the residual method as the vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
we defer revenue for any undelivered elements  and recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the vsoe of fair value of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved  and there are no customer negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
an assessment of the ability of the company s customers to pay is another consideration that affects revenue recognition 
in some cases  the company sells to undercapitalized customers 
in those circumstances  revenue recognition is deferred until cash is received  the customer has established a history of making timely payments or the customer s financial condition has improved 
furthermore  once revenue has been recognized  the company evaluates the related accounts receivable balance at each period end for amounts that we believe may no longer be collectible 
this evaluation is largely done based on a review of the financial condition via credit agencies and historical experience with the customer 
any deterioration in credit worthiness of a customer may impact the company s evaluation of accounts receivable in any given period 
revenue from support and maintenance activities  which consist of fees for ongoing support and unspecified product updates  are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  typically one year  and the associated costs are expensed as incurred 
consulting and implementation services are performed on a best efforts basis and may be billed under time and materials or fixed price arrangements 
revenues and expenses relating to providing consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from hosting activities  which consist of fees for storing customer data  are recognized as the services are performed  and the associated costs are expensed as incurred 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to the government are presented on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheet 
at april  and the company had  and  of sales taxes payable 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of april  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists 
all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization 
as a result of the impairment test  the company recorded million for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the ediscovery business unit 
the unify and axs one business units were not at risk of failing step one of the impairment test 
refer to item  note for additional discussion of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment test 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred taxes are recorded for the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not 
us income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as they are considered to be permanently reinvested 
as of april   the company had million of deferred tax assets related principally to net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards  reserves and other accruals  and various tax credits 
the company s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may not be fully realized because of certain limitations imposed by the tax law related to changes in ownership 
in addition  the company s ability to ultimately realize its deferred tax assets is contingent upon the company achieving taxable income in the future 
there is no assurance that this will occur in amounts sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  management concluded that a valuation allowance be recorded to offset these deferred tax assets 
should we determine that daegis would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recognized in the period such determination was made 
account receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and they do not bear interest 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make these estimates based on an analysis of accounts receivable using available information on our customers financial status and payment histories as well as the age of the account receivable 
historically  bad debt losses have not differed materially from our estimates 
accounting for stock based compensation for our share based payment awards  we make estimates and assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options  including volatility  expected term and forfeiture rates 
changes to these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on the value and timing of stock based compensation expense recognized  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
fair value of common stock warrant liability the company accounts for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity asc 
the company values its warrants based on open form option pricing models which  based on the relevant inputs  render the fair value estimate level the company bases its estimates of fair value for liabilities on the amount it would pay a third party market participant to transfer the liability and incorporates inputs such as equity prices  historical and implied volatilities  dividend rates and prices of convertible securities issued by comparable companies maximizing the use of observable inputs when available 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as gain loss from change in fair value of common stock warrant liability

we sell our database  archive  and migration solutions through our direct sales force in the united states and europe  and through indirect channels comprised of distributors  isvs  vars  and other partners worldwide

total revenues in fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or from fiscal revenues of million 
total ediscovery revenues in fiscal were million a decrease of million or from fiscal ediscovery revenues of million 
the decrease is primarily related to having fewer large legal matters in process in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is partially offset by having twelve months of ediscovery revenue in the fiscal and only ten months of ediscovery revenue in fiscal total database  archive  and migration revenues in fiscal were million  a decrease of million or from fiscal database  archive  and migration revenues of million

as the acquisition of daegis occurred in june   there was no ediscovery revenue in fiscal total database  archive  and migrations revenues in fiscal were million  a decrease of million or from fiscal database  archive  and migration revenues of million

impairments of goodwill and intangible assets 
in connection with the company s annual impairment analysis  in fiscal the company recorded impairment charges of million for the goodwill related to the acquisition of daegis  representing of its carrying value 
additionally  the company recorded impairment charges of million for the intangible assets related to the acquisition of daegis 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year we identified certain indicators that the goodwill and intangibles assets in our ediscovery division could potentially be impaired 
while ediscovery revenues had declined some in previous quarters  a new version of our ediscovery software was released late in the third quarter which we expected would result in an increase in revenue in the fourth quarter 
however  these expected revenue improvements did not materialize during the fourth quarter 
also in the fourth quarter we experienced a decrease in the number of new matters being received from existing customers and we had limited success adding new customers 
further  our stock price dropped significantly in the fourth quarter which we anticipated would negatively impact the market capitalization reconciliation analysis which is a part of the impairment testing process 
because of these factors the company determined it necessary to perform a comprehensive review of the ediscovery segment 
as a result of this review  our estimates of future projected revenue and cash flows for the ediscovery segment were reduced 
the decision to reduce our future estimates of projected revenue and cash flows  coupled with a significant drop in our stock price were the primary factors that led to our recording of the impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the company s annual impairment analysis  in fiscal the company recorded impairment charges of million for the goodwill related to the acquisition of ciphersoft  representing of its carrying value  and million for the goodwill related to the acquisition of axs one  representing of its carrying value 
additionally  the company recorded impairment charges of million for the intangible assets related to the acquisition of ciphersoft and million for the intangible assets related to the acquisition of axs one 
the primary reason for these impairment charges is the company s fourth quarter of fiscal decision to redirect its business focus and allocate more resources into the ediscovery business which caused us to reduce our estimates of projected revenue and cash flows for ciphersoft and axs one 
change in fair value of contingent consideration 
in applying asc  business combinations  to the june acquisition of axs one  the company calculated the fair value of contingent consideration related to net license revenue on a quarterly basis and recorded any change in the calculated amount as adjustments in the statement of operations

recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence of selling price or third party evidence of selling price cannot be determined for deliverables in an arrangement  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
the new guidance became effective for daegis beginning may  this guidance was applied prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after may  and did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires additional disclosures about transfers between levels and of the fair value hierarchy and disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
the guidance also clarifies certain existing disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation at which fair value measurements are provided for each class of assets and liabilities instead of major category and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements that fall in either level or level the new guidance became effective for daegis beginning may  this did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio  which consists of cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are stated at cost 
cash equivalents are generally maintained in money market accounts which have as their objective preservation of principal 
the company does not believe its exposure to interest rate risk is material for cash and cash equivalents  which totaled million as of april  daegis had no short term investments at april  in june  the company entered into the wells fargo credit agreement 
the wells fargo credit agreement consists of a million term note a  a million term note b  and a revolving credit note agreement whereby wells fargo would provide up to million 
the term note a  term note b  and revolving line of credit have interest rate of libor plus  and  respectively 
the minimum libor used in the interest rate is for term note a and the revolving line of credit and for term note b 
libor at april  is approximately 
should the libor interest rate increase above during the life of the term loans and of the revolver  the company would have exposure to interest rate risk 
as of april   there was million outstanding on the term notes and million outstanding on the revolver 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its short term investment portfolio  and places its investments with high quality issuers only and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company is averse to principal loss and attempts to ensure the safety of its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have an adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial position 
historically  the company s primary exposures have related to local currency denominated sales and expenses in europe  japan and australia 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against the major european currencies  it results in lower revenues and expenses recorded for those regions when translated into us dollars 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  the company cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results 
although daegis takes into account changes in exchange rates over time in its pricing strategy  it does so only on an annual basis  resulting in substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between annual pricing reviews
