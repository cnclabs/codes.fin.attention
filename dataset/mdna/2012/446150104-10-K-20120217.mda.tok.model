table of contents executive overview financial performance review in  we reported net income of million  or per common share  up million from see table 
the primary driver of the increase was improved credit quality during  which resulted in a decline in provision for credit losses by million  or  when compared to this benefit to net income was offset somewhat by a decline in noninterest income of and an increase in noninterest expense of 
despite the challenging economic and extended low interest rate environment coupled with impacts of government mandated reductions in fee income during  and a slower mortgage market  we were able to produce a return on average total assets of  up from in we also saw continuing results from our strategic business investments and optimal customer relationship ocr sales approach 
also  see significant items influencing financial performance comparisons within the discussion of results of operations 
fully taxable equivalent net interest income was billion in  up slightly from average earning assets increased billion  or  including a billion  or increase in total loans and leases 
this reflected benefits from our strategic c i initiatives focusing on large corporate  asset based lending  and equipment finance 
it also reflected growth in the automobile portfolio 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in our cre portfolio  reflecting the continued execution of our plan to reduce total cre exposure  primarily in the noncore portfolio 
average core deposits grew billion  or  reflecting our consumer household and commercial relationship growth 
this growth continued even as we continued to focus on fundamentally changing our deposit mix and driving down the overall cost of funds 
the net interest margin declined basis points to from 
the decline reflected lower loan and securities yields due to the extended low interest rate environment  partially offset by the positive impacts of growth in low cost deposits and lower deposit pricing 
noninterest income was billion in  a decrease compared with we experienced growth in certain fee businesses during the year including capital markets fees and brokerage income 
we also had a gain on sale of loans from our third quarter automobile securitization 
these increases were offset by declines in mortgage banking income  as originations decreased from the prior year 
additionally  we experienced declines in service charges on deposit accounts  reflecting our implementation of changes to regulation e and our fair play banking philosophy which were somewhat offset by activity growth due to a increase in consumer households during noninterest expense was billion in  a increase compared with this reflected increases in personnel costs  expenses associated with the conversion to a new debit card processor  and the costs related to implementation of strategic initiatives 
these increases were partially offset by declines in oreo and foreclosure expenses  as credit quality continued to improve  as well as lower professional services costs 
credit quality performance continued to show strong improvement as our nals and ncos declined and reserve coverage increased 
compared with the prior year  nals declined 
ncos were million  or an annualized of average total loans and leases  down from million  or an annualized in while the acl as a percentage of loans and leases was  down from at december   it is near peer averages and our acl as a percentage of total nals increased to from 
the level of criticized commercial loans also declined billion  or  from last year 
the provision for credit losses declined million  or  from at december   our regulatory tier and total risk based capital were billion and billion  respectively  above the well capitalized regulatory thresholds 
our tangible common equity ratio improved basis points to and our tier common risk based capital ratio improved basis points to from december  during the fourth quarter  we replaced a portion of our trust preferred securities with preferred stock  which we believe will qualify as additional tier risk based capital under regulations arising from the dodd frank act 

table of contents business overview general our general business objectives are grow net interest income and fee income  increase cross sell and share of wallet across all business segments  improve efficiency ratio  and continue to strengthen risk management  including sustained improvement in credit metrics 
the main challenges to accomplishing our primary objectives in resulted from an economy that  while more stable than a year earlier  remained fragile  a prolonged low interest rate environment  which put pressure on our net interest margin  lost fee income due to new regulations  and more overhead and expenses related to increased risk management as a consequence of the dodd frank act 
as is the nature of a mature industry with arguably overcapacity  we faced strong competition from other banks and financial service firms in our markets 
this is expected to continue 
to address these challenges  beginning in the second half of and continuing today  we place strategic emphasis on developing and expanding resources to improve cross sell performance within our consumer and business customer bases 
in this regard  our ocr methodology continued to deliver strong success in on the consumer side  consumer checking account households grew  which was more than higher than in  and nearly four times the rate of growth in our cross sell performance also continued to improve 
at the end of the year  of our consumer checking account households utilized over four products 
this compared with a year earlier 
growth in commercial relationships was in at the end of the year  of our commercial relationships used over four products or services  up from a year earlier 
our fair play philosophy  coupled with an increasingly effective ocr focus  while positively impacting results  also positions us for better long term performance 
economy during  there continued to be a high level of uncertainty and volatility surrounding the economy  though late in the year we saw more encouraging signs 
unemployment rates as of december for ohio  pennsylvania  and west virginia were below the national unemployment average 
indiana  michigan  and kentucky were slightly above the national average  but they also declined  and the rate in michigan was the lowest since september midwest housing prices generally did not rise as much during the housing boom years  and have therefore not gone down as much during the housing crisis 
midwest housing markets are expected to continue to reflect the general state of the labor markets  which are expected to continue to improve 
manufacturing exports are a regional strength 
michigan and ohio are two of the top states for manufacturing exports  and indiana is number for michigan in particular  the future success of export growth will likely hold a key to long term economic growth 
both office and industrial vacancy rates have been easing downward  but have remained generally high relative to the national average 
therefore  stresses in these loan classes will likely persist 
however  vacancy rates should continue to ease downward assuming an economic recovery and expansionary phase in however  issues may exist in markets with especially high vacancy rates 
legislative and regulatory regulatory reforms continued to be adopted which impose additional restrictions on business practices 
recent actions affecting us included the federal reserve s capital plan review and maturity extension program  and other rules and regulations that have been issued pursuant to the dodd frank act 
capital plan review we are participating in the federal reserve s capital plan review cappr stress test process and made our capital plan submission in january the federal reserve will evaluate our capital plan based on our risk profile and the strength of our internal capital assessment process under regulatory capital standards currently applicable and in accordance with our plans to address proposed revisions to the regulatory capital framework as set forth in basel iii and relevant provisions of the dodd frank act 
the federal reserve s evaluation will take into consideration any capital distribution plans  such as plans to increase common stock 
table of contents dividends or to reinstate common stock repurchase programs 
we expect to receive the results of their evaluation by the end of the first quarter 
while we can give no assurances as to the outcome or specific interactions with the regulators  we believe we have a strong capital position 
federal reserve maturity extension program under the maturity extension program operation twist announced on september   the federal reserve noted its intention to sell billion of shorter term treasury securities by the end of and use the proceeds to buy longer term securities 
this will extend the average maturity of the securities in the federal reserve s portfolio 
by reducing the supply of longer term securities in the market  it is the fomc s intention to put downward pressure on longer term interest rates  including rates on financial assets that investors consider to be close substitutes for longer term treasury securities 
further  it is their objective that the reduction in longer term interest rates  in turn  will contribute to a broad easing in financial market conditions that will provide additional stimulus to support the economic recovery 
we do not anticipate that this program will have a material impact on our current securities portfolio or future investment strategy 
however  it could cause our net interest margin to decline modestly 
for further discussion  see the market risk section of our md a 
durbin amendment the durbin amendment to the dodd frank act instructed the federal reserve to review and establish the rate merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit card transactions ie  the interchange rate 
as part of its review  the federal reserve s objective was to establish standards for assessing debit card interchange fees receivable by debit card issuers that are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by the issuers for electronic debit transactions 
during  the federal reserve issued its final rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions 
under the final rule  the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of cents per transaction  a cent fraud prevention adjustment  and basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction 
this provision regarding debit card interchange fees became effective on october  as a result of implementing this lower debit card interchange fee structure  our fourth quarter electronic banking income declined million from the third quarter 
resolution plan the federal reserve and fdic issued final regulations as required by section of the dodd frank act regarding resolution plans  also referred to as living wills 
insured depository institutions with billion or more in total assets must submit to the fdic a plan whereby the institution can be resolved by the fdic  in the event of failure  in a manner that ensures depositors will receive access to insured funds within the required timeframes and generally ensures an orderly liquidation of the institution 
additionally  bank holding companies with assets of billion or more are required to submit to the federal reserve and the fdic a plan that  in the event of material financial distress or failure  establishes the rapid and orderly liquidation of the company under the bankruptcy code and in a way that would not pose systemic risk to the financial system of the united states 
the regulations allow for a tiered approach for complying with the requirements based on materiality of the institution 
currently  we are required to submit resolution plans as prescribed by december  recent industry developments recent industry events and related supervisory guidance brought about by the continued weak housing market have caused us to evaluate certain aspects of our mortgage operations  including a review of our msr valuation 
mortgage servicing rights msr fair values are estimated based on residential mortgage servicing revenue in excess of estimated market costs to service the underlying loans 
historically  the estimated market cost to service has been stable 
due to changes in the regulatory environment related to loan servicing and foreclosure activities since in reaction to the housing crises  costs to service mortgages are likely to increase  though the potential impact on the market costs to service remains uncertain 
certain large residential mortgage loan servicers entered into consent orders with banking regulators in april  which require the 
table of contents servicers to remedy deficiencies and unsafe or unsound practices and to enhance residential mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes 
it is unclear what impact this may ultimately have on market costs to service 
expectations as we have done since early  we will continue to execute our core strategy  making selective investments in initiatives to grow long term profitability 
we will remain disciplined in our growth and pricing of loans and deposits and are encouraged by the net interest margin expansion during the fourth quarter 
we continue to expect credit quality to improve 
we will stay focused on increasing customer cross sell  and work to improve operating efficiency 
while there continues to be a high level of uncertainty and volatility surrounding the economy  late in the year we saw more encouraging signs 
over the course of  net interest income is expected to show modest improvement from the fourth quarter level 
the momentum we are seeing in total loan and low cost deposit growth is expected to continue 
earlier in  those benefits are expected to be mostly offset by downward pressure on the net interest margin due to the anticipated continued mix shift to lower rate  higher quality loans and lower securities reinvestment rates given the low absolute level of interest rates and shape of the yield curve 
our c i portfolio is expected to continue to show meaningful growth with much of this reflecting the positive impact from strategic initiatives to expand our commercial lending expertise into areas like specialty banking  asset based lending  and equipment financing  in addition to our long standing continued support of middle market and small business lending 
for automobile loans  we will continue to evaluate the use of automobile loan securitizations to limit total on balance sheet exposure as we expect to see continued strong levels of originations 
on december   we transferred billion of automobile loans to loans held for sale  as we plan to complete another securitization during the first half of residential mortgages and home equity loans are expected to show modest growth  with cre likely to experience slowing declines 
we anticipate the increase in total loans to modestly outpace growth in total deposits  reflecting a heightened focus on our overall cost of funding and the continued shift towards low and no cost demand deposits and money market deposit accounts 
noninterest income is expected to show a modest increase throughout from fourth quarter levels 
this is primarily due to anticipated growth in new customers and increased contribution from key fee income activities including capital markets  treasury management services  and brokerage  reflecting the impact of our cross sell and product penetration initiatives throughout the company 
we anticipate making progress on improving our operating efficiency ratio  though this will likely reflect the benefit of revenue growth as we expect expenses could increase 
while we will continue our focus on improving operating efficiencies  improvement could be offset by additional regulatory costs and expenses associated with strategic actions  such as in store branch partnerships and the consolidation of certain traditional branches 
nonaccrual loans and net charge offs are expected to continue to decline 
the level of provision for credit losses is currently in line with our long term expectations 
however  there could be some quarterly volatility given the absolute low level and the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery 
we anticipate the effective tax rate to approximate of income before income taxes  less approximately million of permanent tax differences primarily related to tax exempt income  tax advantaged investments  and general business credits

for additional insight on financial performance  please read this section in conjunction with the item business segment discussion 
significant items definition of significant items from time to time  revenue  expenses  or taxes  are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and or by items that  while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities  are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature 
we refer to such items as significant items 
most often  these significant items result from factors originating outside the company  eg  regulatory actions assessments  windfall gains  changes in accounting principles  one time tax assessments refunds  litigation actions  etc 
in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business  eg  merger restructuring charges  recapitalization actions  goodwill impairment  etc 
even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions  as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item 
for example  changes in the provision for credit losses  gains losses from investment activities  asset valuation writedowns  etc  reflect ordinary banking activities and are  therefore  typically excluded from consideration as a significant item 
management believes the disclosure of significant items in current and prior period results aids analysts investors in better understanding corporate performance and trends so that they can ascertain which of such items  if any  they may wish to include exclude from their analysis of the company s performance ie  within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations  as well as how  if at all  to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly 
to this end  management has adopted a practice of listing significant items in its external disclosure documents eg  earnings press releases  quarterly performance discussions  investor presentations  forms q and k 
significant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance 
significant items influencing financial performance comparisons earnings comparisons among the three years ended december    and were impacted by a number of significant items summarized below 
early extinguishment of debt 
the positive impacts relating to the early extinguishment of debt on our reported results were million per common share in and million per common share in these amounts were recorded as reductions to noninterest expense 
visa 
prior to the visa ipo occurring in march  visa was owned by its member banks  which included the bank 
as a result of this ownership  we received class b shares of visa stock at the time of the visa ipo 
in the second quarter  we sold these visa stock shares  resulting in a million pretax gain 
per common share 
this amount was recorded to noninterest income 
in  a million derivative loss due to an increase in the liability associated with the sale of these shares was recorded to noninterest income 

table of contents litigation reserve 
during the first quarter  million of additions to litigation reserves were recorded as other noninterest expense 
this resulted in a negative impact of per common share 
tarp capital purchase program repurchase 
during the fourth quarter  we issued million of our common stock and million of subordinated debt 
the net proceeds  along with other available funds  were used to repurchase all billion of tarp capital that we issued to the treasury under its tarp capital purchase program in as part of this transaction  there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net income  but resulted in a negative impact of per common share for goodwill impairment 
the impacts of goodwill impairment on our reported results were as follows during the first quarter  bank stock prices  including ours  experienced a steep decline 
our stock price declined from per share at december   to per share at march  given this significant decline  we conducted an interim test for goodwill impairment 
as a result  we recorded a noncash  million per common share pretax charge 
see goodwill discussion located within the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates section for additional information 
during the second quarter  a pretax goodwill impairment of million per common share was recorded relating to the sale of a small payments related business in july franklin relationship 
our relationship with franklin was acquired in the sky financial acquisition 
significant events relating to this relationship  and the impacts of those events on our reported results  were as follows on march   we restructured our relationship with franklin 
as a result of this restructuring  a nonrecurring net tax benefit of million per common share was recorded in the first quarter 
also  and although earnings were not significantly impacted  commercial ncos increased million as the previously established million franklin specific alll was utilized to writedown the acquired mortgages and oreo collateral to fair value 
during the first quarter  a million per common share net tax benefit was recognized  primarily reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating to the assets acquired from the march  restructuring 
during the second quarter  the portfolio of franklin related loans million of residential mortgages and million of home equity loans was transferred to loans held for sale 
at the time of the transfer  the loans were marked to the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell of million  resulting in million of charge offs  and the provision for credit losses commensurately increased million per common share 
during the third quarter  the remaining franklin related residential mortgage and home equity loans were sold at essentially book value 
preferred stock conversion 
during the first and second quarters  we converted  and  shares  respectively  of series a non cumulative perpetual preferred series a preferred stock stock into common stock 
as part of these transactions  there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net income  but resulted in a negative impact of per common share for see capital discussion located within the risk management and capital section for additional information

pretax  pre provision income trends one non gaap performance measurement that we believe is useful in analyzing underlying performance trends  particularly in times of economic stress  is pretax  pre provision income 
this is the level of earnings adjusted to exclude the impact of a provision expense  which is excluded because its absolute level is elevated and volatile in times of economic stress  b investment securities gains losses  which are excluded because securities market valuations may also become particularly volatile in times of economic stress  c amortization of intangibles expense  which is excluded because the return on tangible equity common equity is a key measurement that we use to gauge performance trends  and d certain other items identified by us see significant items above that we believe may distort our underlying performance trends

pretax  pre provision income was million in  down million  or  from the prior year 
as discussed in the sections that follow  the decrease primarily reflected the negative impact from lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense as compared to the prior year 
net interest income average balance sheet our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from earning assets primarily loans  securities  and direct financing leases  and interest expense of funding sources primarily interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
earning asset balances and related funding sources  as well as changes in the levels of interest rates  impact net interest income 
the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities is the net interest spread 
noninterest bearing sources of funds  such as demand deposits and shareholders equity  also support earning assets 
the impact of the noninterest bearing sources of funds  often referred to as free funds  is captured in the net interest margin  which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets 
both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis  which means that tax free interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income  assuming a tax rate 

table of contents the following table shows changes in fully taxable equivalent interest income  interest expense  and net interest income due to volume and rate variances for major categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through we have appealed certain proposed adjustments resulting from the irs examination of our and tax returns 
we believe our positions related to such proposed adjustments are correct and supported by applicable statutes  regulations  and judicial authority  and intend to vigorously defend them 
during  we entered into discussions with the appeals division of the irs 
it is possible the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments  if unfavorable  may be material to the results of 
table of contents operations in the period it occurs 
nevertheless  although no assurances can be given  we believe that the resolution of these examinations will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position 
in the third quarter  the irs began its examination of our and consolidated federal income tax returns 
various state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination  including kentucky  indiana  michigan  pennsylvania  west virginia and illinois 
versus the provision for income taxes was million for compared with a benefit of million in both years included the benefits from tax exempt income  tax advantaged investments  and general business credits

the franklin restructuring in resulted in a million net deferred tax asset equal to the amount of income and equity that was included in our operating results for during  a million net tax benefit was recognized  primarily reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating to the assets acquired from the march  franklin restructuring 
risk management and capital risk awareness  identification and assessment  reporting  and active management are key elements in overall risk management 
we manage risk to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks 
controls include  among others  effective segregation of duties  access  authorization and reconciliation procedures  as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process 
we identify primary risks  and the sources of those risks  within each business unit 
we utilize risk and control self assessments rcsa to identify exposure risks 
through this rcsa process  we continually assess the effectiveness of controls associated with the identified risks  regularly monitor risk profiles and material exposure to losses  and identify stress events and scenarios to which we may be exposed 
our chief risk officer is responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems of controls are in place for managing and monitoring risk across the company 
potential risk concerns are shared with the risk management committee and the board of directors  as appropriate 
our internal audit department performs on going independent reviews of the risk management process and ensures the adequacy of documentation 
the results of these reviews are reported regularly to the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe our primary risk exposures are credit  market  liquidity  operational  and compliance risk 
credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a counterparty s ability to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues  investor and customer perception of financial strength  and events unrelated to us  such as war  terrorism  or financial institution market specific issues 
in addition  the mix and maturity structure of huntington s balance sheet  amount of on hand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding  can have an impact on huntington s ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments 
we manage liquidity risk at both the bank and the parent company 
operational risk arises from our inherent day to day operations that could result in losses due to human error  inadequate or failed internal systems and controls  and external events 
compliance risk exposes us to money penalties  enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws  rules  and regulations that apply to the financial services industry 

table of contents some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit  market  liquidity  operational  and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphs 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation 
the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities  as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending 
we also have significant credit risk associated with our available for sale and other investment and held to maturity securities portfolio see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing  asset and liability management  mortgage banking  and for trading activities 
given the current level of global financial issues  we believe it is important to provide clarity around our exposure in this specific area see european sovereign debt and counterparty exposure section 
while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity  we believe this exposure is minimal 
the significant change in the economic conditions and the resulting changes in borrower behavior over the past several years resulted in our continuing focus on the identification  monitoring  and managing of our credit risk 
in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes  market risk management activities  and portfolio diversification  we added more quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources  enhanced use of modeling technology  and internal stress testing processes 
the continued expansion of our portfolio management resources demonstrates our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk profile 
in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques  we have focused on product design features  origination policies  and treatment strategies for delinquent or stressed borrowers 
the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers 
all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated 
concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type  geography  industry  and loan quality factors 
we continue to focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets  although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives 
we continue to add new borrowers that meet our targeted risk and profitability profile 
although we offer a broad set of products  we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities 
each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk portfolio profile 
the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess the level of credit risk being accepted  facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur  and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution 
for example  we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position 
asset quality metrics improved significantly in  reflecting our proactive portfolio management initiatives as well as some stabilization in a still relatively weak economy 
the improvements in the asset quality metrics  including lower levels of npas  commercial criticized and classified assets  and delinquencies have all been achieved through these policies and commitments 
our portfolio management policies demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk profile 
to that end  we continue to expand resources in our risk management areas 
although credit quality significantly improved in  the weak residential real estate market and us economy continued to negatively impact us and the financial services industry as a whole 
the pronounced 
table of contents downturn in the residential real estate market that began in early resulted in significantly lower residential real estate values and higher delinquencies and ncos  including loans to builders and developers of residential real estate 
in addition  continued high unemployment  among other economic conditions  throughout and  slowed any significant recovery from the us recession 
as a result  we continued to experience higher than historical levels of delinquencies and ncos in our loan portfolios  with some continued negative pressure on the value of our investment securities backed by residential assets 
loan and lease credit exposure mix at december   our loans and leases totaled billion  representing a increase from december   primarily reflecting growth in the c i  residential mortgage  and home equity portfolios 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in the automobile portfolio reflecting the third quarter automobile securitization and the transfer of automobile loans to loans held for sale related to a planned automobile securitization see automobile portfolio discussion  and the continued decline of the cre portfolio reflecting our planned strategy to reduce our noncore cre exposure 
at december   commercial loans totaled billion  and represented of our total credit exposure 
our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type  customer size  and geography within our footprint  and is comprised of the following see commercial credit discussion c i loans c i loans are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs  equipment purchases  or other projects 
the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions 
c i loans are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and or the personal guarantee of the business owners 
the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a c i loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral 
this treatment is a function of the credit decision process  which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt 
the operation  sale  rental  or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans 
as we look to grow our c i loan portfolio  we have further developed our abl capabilities by adding experienced abl professionals to take advantage of market opportunities resulting in better leveraging of the manufacturing base in our primary markets 
also  our equipment finance area is targeting larger equipment financings in the manufacturing sector in addition to our core products 
we also expanded our large corporate banking group with sufficient resources to ensure we appropriately recognize and manage the risks associated with this type of lending 
cre loans cre loans consist of loans for income producing real estate properties  real estate investment trusts  and real estate developers 
we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement 
these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings  office and industrial buildings  and retail shopping centers  and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation  sale  or refinance of the property 
construction cre loans construction cre loans are loans to individuals  companies  or developers used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property 
our construction cre portfolio primarily consists of retail  residential land  single family  and condominiums  office  and warehouse project types 
generally  these loans are for construction projects that have been presold  preleased  or have secured permanent financing  as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project 
these loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule 
total consumer loans were billion at december   and represented of our total credit exposure 
the consumer portfolio was diversified primarily among automobile  home equity loans and lines of credit  and residential mortgages see consumer credit discussion 

table of contents automobile automobile loans and leases are primarily comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships and include exposure in selected states outside of our primary banking markets 
no state outside of our primary banking market represented more than of our total automobile portfolio at december  in late  we expanded into minnesota and wisconsin  and in  we expanded into eastern pennsylvania and five new england states 
the expansions were based on hiring experienced colleagues within the new markets that have existing dealer relationships 
we have a loan securitization strategy to maintain any growth within our established portfolio concentration limits 
home equity home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit 
this type of lending  which is secured by a first lien or second lien on the borrower s residence  allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home 
given the current low interest rate environment  many borrowers have utilized the line of credit home equity product as the primary source of financing their home versus residential mortgages 
as a result  the proportion of the home equity portfolio secured by a first lien has increased significantly over the past three years  positively impacting the portfolio s performance 
the portfolio s credit risk profile is substantially reduced when we hold a first lien position 
during  of our home equity portfolio originations were secured by a first lien 
the first lien position combined with continued high average fico scores significantly reduces the pd associated with these loans 
the combination provides a strong base when assessing the expected future performance of this portfolio 
real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended and  in the event of default  subsequent changes in these values impact the severity of losses 
we actively manage the extension of credit and the amount of credit extended through a combination of criteria including financial position  debt to income policies  and ltv policy limits 
residential mortgages residential mortgages represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence 
these loans are generally financed over a year to year term  and in most cases  are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence 
generally  our practice is to sell a significant portion of our fixed rate originations in the secondary market 
as such  at december   of our total residential mortgage portfolio were arms 
these arms primarily consist of a fixed rate of interest for the first to years  and then adjust annually 
we are subject to repurchase risk associated with residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market 
an appropriate level of accounting reserve for representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans sold has been established to address this repurchase risk inherent in the portfolio see operational risk discussion 
other consumer loans leases primarily consists of consumer loans not secured by real estate  including personal unsecured loans 

table of contents the table below provides the composition of our total loan and lease portfolio table loan and lease portfolio composition at december  dollar amounts in millions commercial commercial and industrial commercial real estate construction commercial total commercial real estate total commercial consumer automobile home equity residential mortgage other consumer total consumer total loans and leases there were no commercial loans outstanding that would be considered a concentration of lending to a particular industry or group of industries 
included a decrease of billion resulting from the transfer of automobile loans to loans held for a sale reflecting an automobile securitization transaction planned for the first half of included an increase of billion resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard to consolidate a previously off balance sheet automobile loan securitization transaction

while these are the primary factors considered  there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process 
for all loans exceeding million  we utilize a centralized senior loan committee  led by our chief credit officer 
for loans less than million  with the exception of small business loans  credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority 
for small business loans  we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures 
in this centralized decision environment  certain individuals who understand each local region may make credit extension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities we operate in 
in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors  a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process 
in commercial lending  on going credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan 
we monitor all significant exposures on an on going basis 
all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrower s pd and lgd severity of loss 
this two dimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process 
the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level 
the lgd is rated and applied based on the type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral 
the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event 
there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an on going basis 
we continually review and adjust our risk rating criteria based on actual experience  which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance amount for the commercial portfolio 
to provide consistent oversight  a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio  including small business loans 

table of contents in addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process  our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and or risk of new loan originations 
this group is part of our risk management area  and conducts portfolio reviews on a risk based cycle to evaluate individual loans  validate risk ratings  as well as test the consistency of the credit processes 
our standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate loan quality and likelihood of repayment  one of which is guarantor support 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if warranted  we consider  among other things  the guarantor s reputation and credit worthiness  along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth  assuming such information is available 
our assessment of the guarantor s credit strength  or lack thereof  is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans  which is directly tied to  and an integral component of  our alll methodology 
when a loan goes to impaired status  viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of the recognition of loan loss 
if our assessment of the guarantor s credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform  we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully 
however  we do not formally track the repayment success from guarantors 
substantially all commercial loans categorized as classified see note of notes to consolidated financial statements are managed by our sad 
the sad is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the day to day management of workouts  commercial recoveries  and problem loan sales 
its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans  assessing risk ratings  and determining the appropriateness of the allowance  the accrual status  and the ultimate collectability of the classified loan portfolio 
our commercial loan portfolio  including cre loans  is diversified by product type  customer size  and geography throughout our footprint 
no outstanding commercial loans and leases comprised an industry or geographic concentration of lending 
certain segments of our commercial loan portfolio are discussed in further detail below 
c i portfolio the c i portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the on going operations of the business 
generally  the loans are secured with the financing of the borrower s assets  such as equipment  accounts receivable  or inventory 
in many cases  the loans are secured by real estate  although the operation  sale  or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan 
for loans secured by real estate  appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements 
there were no commercial loan segments considered an industry or geographic concentration of lending 
currently  higher risk segments of the c i portfolio include loans to borrowers supporting the home building industry  contractors  and automotive suppliers 
we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio through origination policies  a defined loan concentration policy with established limits  on going loan level reviews and portfolio level reviews  recourse requirements  and continuous portfolio risk management activities 
our origination policies for this portfolio include loan product type specific policies such as ltv and debt service coverage ratios  as applicable 
while c i borrowers have been challenged by the weak economy  problem loans have trended downward  reflecting a combination of proactive risk identification as well as some relative improvement in economic conditions 
nevertheless  some borrowers may no longer have sufficient capital to withstand the extended stress 
as a result  these borrowers may not be able to comply with the original terms of their credit agreements 
we continue to focus attention on the portfolio management process to proactively identify borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty to assess all potential solutions 
the impact of the economic environment is further evidenced by the level of line of credit activity  as borrowers continued to maintain relatively low utilization percentages 

table of contents cre portfolio we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to cre lending  focusing on the quality of the developer  and the specifics associated with each project 
generally  we limit our loans to of the appraised value of the commercial real estate  require net operating cash flows to be of required interest and principal payments  and if the commercial real estate is nonowner occupied  require that at least of the space of the project be preleased 
additionally  we established a limit to our cre exposure of no more than our amount of tier risk based capital plus the acl 
we have been actively reducing our cre exposure during the past three years  and our cre exposure met this established limit at december  we actively monitor both geographic and project type concentrations and performance metrics of all cre loan types  with a focus on higher risk classes 
both macro level and loan level stress test scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the on going portfolio management process for the cre portfolio 
dedicated real estate professionals originated the majority of the portfolio  with the remainder obtained from prior bank acquisitions 
appraisals are obtained from approved vendors  and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process 
the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size  and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio 
subsequent to the origination of the loan  the credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and or risk of new loan originations 
appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals  and on an as needed basis  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
we continue to perform on going portfolio level reviews within the cre portfolio 
these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed 
property values are updated using appraisals on a regular basis to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the on going management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions 
this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers  as well as an in depth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environment 
each cre loan is classified as either core or noncore 
we separated the cre portfolio into these categories in order to provide more clarity around our portfolio management strategies and to provide additional clarity for us and our investors 
we believe segregating the noncore cre from core cre improves our ability to understand the nature  performance prospects  and problem resolution opportunities of these segments  thus allowing us to continue to deal proactively with any emerging credit issues 
a cre loan is generally considered core when the borrower is an experienced  well capitalized developer in our midwest footprint  and has either an established meaningful relationship with us that generates an acceptable return on capital or demonstrates the prospect of becoming one 
the core cre portfolio was billion at december   representing of total cre loans 
the performance of the core portfolio met our expectations based on the consistency of the asset quality metrics within the portfolio 
based on our extensive project level assessment process  including forward looking collateral valuations  we continue to believe the credit quality of the core portfolio is stable 
loans are not reclassified between the core and noncore segments based on performance  and as such  we do not anticipate an elevated level of problem loans in the core portfolio 
a cre loan is generally considered noncore based on the lack of a substantive relationship outside of the loan product  with no immediate prospects for meeting the core relationship criteria 
the noncore cre portfolio declined from billion at december   to billion at december   and represented of total cre loans 
of the loans in the noncore portfolio at december   were classified as pass  had guarantors  nearly were secured  and were located within our geographic footprint 
however  it is within the noncore portfolio where most of the credit quality challenges exist 
for example  billion  or  of related outstanding balances  are classified as nals 
we expect to exit the majority of noncore cre relationships over time through normal repayments and refinancings  possible sales should economically attractive opportunities arise  or the reclassification to a core cre relationship if it expands to meet the core criteria 

table of contents credit quality data regarding the acl and nals  segregated by core cre loans and noncore cre loans  is presented in the following table table commercial real estate core vs 
noncore portfolios december  ending balance prior ncos acl acl credit mark nonaccrual loans dollar amounts in millions total core noncore sad noncore other total noncore total commercial real estate december  ending balance prior ncos acl acl credit mark nonaccrual loans total core noncore sad noncore other total noncore total commercial real estate calculated as prior ncos acl ending balance prior ncos noncore loans managed by sad  the area responsible for managing loans and relationships designated as classified loans 
as shown in the above table  the ending balance of the cre portfolio at december   declined billion  or  compared with december  of this decline  occurred in the noncore segment of the portfolio administered by sad  and was a result of payoffs and ncos as we actively focused on the noncore portfolio to reduce our overall cre exposure 
this reduction demonstrates our continued commitment to achieving a materially lower risk profile in the cre portfolio  consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk profile 
we anticipate further noncore cre declines  consistent with our strategy to continue to reduce our overall cre exposure 
the reduction in the core segment is a result of normal portfolio attrition combined with limited origination activity 
we will continue to support our core developer customers as appropriate  however  we do not believe that significant additional cre activity is appropriate given our current exposure in cre lending and the current economic conditions 
also as shown above  substantial reserves for the noncore portfolio have been established 
at december   the acl related to the noncore portfolio was 
the combination of the existing acl and prior ncos represents the total credit actions taken on each segment of the portfolio 
from this data  we calculate a credit mark that provides a consistent measurement of the cumulative credit actions taken against a specific portfolio segment 
the credit mark associated with the sad managed noncore portfolio is an indicator of the aggressive portfolio management strategy employed for this portfolio 
consumer credit consumer credit approvals are based on  among other factors  the financial strength and payment history of the borrower  type of exposure  and the transaction structure 
consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models 
importantly  certain individuals who understand each local 
table of contents region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities we operate in 
each credit extension is assigned a specific pd and lgd 
the pd is generally based on the borrower s most recent credit bureau score fico  which we update quarterly  while the lgd is related to the type of collateral and the ltv ratio associated with the credit extension 
in consumer lending  credit risk is managed from a segment ie  loan type  collateral position  geography  etc 
and vintage performance analysis 
all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators 
we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio  which may result in changes to future origination strategies 
the on going analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll amount for our consumer loan portfolio 
the independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes 
collection action is initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function 
the collection group employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing efficiency 
in addition to the consumer loan portfolio  the collection group is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases 
collection practices include a single contact point for the majority of the residential real estate secured portfolios 
automobile loans and leases portfolio our strategy in the automobile loan and lease portfolio continued to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both fico and internal custom scores  combined with appropriate ltv s  terms  and a reasonable level of profitability 
our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio  including our newer markets 
although increased origination volume and the entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels  we believe our strategy and operational capabilities significantly mitigate these risks 
we continued to consistently execute our value proposition and took advantage of market opportunities that allowed us to grow our automobile loan portfolio 
the significant growth in the portfolio was accomplished while maintaining high credit quality metrics 
as we further execute our strategies and take advantage of these opportunities  we have developed and implemented a loan securitization strategy to maintain any growth within our established portfolio concentration limits 
we have continued to expand our origination markets by entering minnesota and wisconsin in late  after entering pennsylvania and five new england states in our market expansion strategy is based on hiring new colleagues with direct experience and established relationships with automobile dealers in the specific market 
in the third quarter  we transferred billion of automobile loans to a trust in a securitization transaction 
the securitization qualified for sale accounting 
as a result of this transaction  we recognized a million gain on sale  which is reflected in noninterest income and recorded a million servicing asset  which is reflected in accrued income and other assets 
additionally  in the fourth quarter  billion of automobile loans were transferred to loans held for sale  reflecting an automobile loan securitization planned for the first half of residential real estate secured portfolios the properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located throughout our geographic footprint 
the continued stress on home prices has caused the performance in these portfolios to remain weaker than historical levels 
we continue to evaluate all of our policies and processes associated with managing these portfolios 
in  we accelerated the timing of charge off recognition in our residential mortgage portfolio 
in addition  we established a writedown policy for loans in short sale situations 
both of these policy changes 
table of contents resulted in accelerated recognition of residential mortgage charge offs totaling million in further  also in  we implemented a policy change regarding the placement of loans on nonaccrual status in both the home equity and residential mortgage portfolios 
this policy change resulted in accelerated placement of loans on nonaccrual status totaling million in the home equity portfolio and million in the residential mortgage portfolio

represents only owned portfolio originations 
home equity portfolio our home equity portfolio loans and lines of credit consists of both first lien and second lien mortgage loans with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores  debt to income ratios  and ltv ratios 
we offer closed end home equity loans which are generally fixed rate with principal and interest payments  and variable rate interest only home equity lines of credit which do not require payment of principal during the year revolving period of the line of credit 
applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system 
at december   of our home equity portfolio was secured by first lien mortgages 
the credit risk profile is substantially reduced when we hold a first lien position 
during  of our home equity portfolio originations were secured by a first mortgage lien 
we focus on high quality borrowers primarily located within our footprint 
the majority of our home equity line of credit borrowers consistently pay more than the minimum payment required in any given month 
additionally  since we focus on developing complete relationships with our customers  many of our home equity borrowers are utilizing our other products and services 
the combination of high quality borrowers as measured by financial condition  fico score  and the lien position status provide a high degree of confidence regarding the performance of the originations 
within the home equity line of credit portfolio  the standard product is a year interest only draw period with a balloon payment and represented a majority of the line of credit portfolio at december  as 
table of contents previously discussed  a significant portion of recent originations are secured by first liens on the underlying property as high quality borrowers take advantage of the current low variable rates available with a line of credit 
if the current year fixed rate declines substantially from its already low level  we would anticipate some portion of these first lien line of credit borrowers to refinance to a more traditional residential mortgage at a fixed rate 
we believe we have underwritten credit conservatively within this portfolio 
we have not originated home equity loans or lines of credit with an ltv at origination greater than  except for infrequent situations with high quality borrowers 
however  continued declines in housing prices have likely decreased the value of the collateral for this portfolio and have caused a portion of the portfolio to have an ltv ratio greater than 
these higher ltv ratios are directly correlated with borrower payment patterns and are a particular focus of our loss mitigation and home saver groups 
we obtain a property valuation for every loan or line of credit at origination 
the type of property valuation obtained is based on a series of credit parameters  and ranges from an avm to a complete walkthrough appraisal 
while we believe an avm estimate is an appropriate valuation source for a portion of our home equity lending activities  we continue to re evaluate all of our policies on an on going basis with the intent of ensuring complete independence in the requesting and reviewing of real estate valuations associated with loan decisions 
we are committed to appropriate valuations for all of our real estate lending  and do not anticipate significant impacts to our loan decision process as a result of these guidelines 
we update values as appropriate  and in compliance with applicable regulations  for loans identified as higher risk 
loans are identified as higher risk based on performance indicators and the updated values are utilized to facilitate our portfolio management processes  as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions 
we continue to make origination policy adjustments based on our assessment of an appropriate risk profile  as well as industry actions 
in addition to origination policy adjustments  we take actions  as necessary  to manage the risk profile of this portfolio 
residential mortgages portfolio we focus on higher quality borrowers and underwrite all applications centrally 
we do not originate residential mortgage loans that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options 
all residential mortgage loans are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process 
we update values on a regular basis in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management  as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions 
at december   of our total residential mortgage loans have adjustable rates 
at december   arm loans that were expected to have rates reset totaled billion through these loans scheduled to reset are primarily associated with loans originated subsequent to  and as such  are not subject to the most significant declines in underlying property value 
given the quality of our borrowers and the relatively low current interest rates  we believe that we have a relatively limited exposure to arm reset risk 
nonetheless  we have taken actions to mitigate our risk exposure 
we initiate borrower contact at least six months prior to the interest rate resetting  and have been successful in converting many arms to fixed rate loans through this process 
several government programs continued to impact the residential mortgage portfolio  including various refinance programs such as hamp and harp  which positively affected the availability of credit for the industry 
during the year ended december   we closed million in harp residential mortgages and million in hamp residential mortgages that are either in our residential mortgage portfolio or serviced for others 
we utilize these programs to enhance our existing strategies of working closely with our customers 

table of contents european sovereign debt and counterparty exposure in the normal course of business  we engage with other financial institutions for a variety of purposes resulting from ordinary banking activities such as payment processing  transactions entered into for risk management purposes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and for investment diversification 
as a result  we are exposed to credit risk  or risk of loss  if the other financial institution fails to perform according to the terms of our contract or agreement 
current european credit pressures have increased concerns about correlated adverse effects upon financial institutions 
specifically  there has been heightened emphasis on direct credit exposure to certain sovereigns  in particular  greece  ireland  portugal  spain and italy  as well as to financial institutions headquartered in those countries 
we analyze and assess each financial institution prior to approval as a counterparty 
our treasury credit risk group within credit administration is responsible for the initial risk assessment as well as on going monitoring 
we actively manage the level of exposure to each financial institution  with regular assessment of the exposure limits by our credit policy and strategy committee 
we believe our overall exposure to financial institutions on a gross basis  including direct credit exposure to any of these named sovereigns and their banks  is not significant in the aggregate 
nonetheless  we minimize this risk through active monitoring and management of each contract or agreement 
credit quality we believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance for is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios 
this approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following npas and nals  tdrs  acl  and ncos 
in addition  we utilize delinquency rates  risk distribution and migration patterns  and product segmentation in the analysis of our credit quality performance 
credit quality performance in improved significantly throughout the year as evidenced by the improvement of every key asset quality metric 
npas declined from december   to december   along with declines in both commercial criticized and classified assets levels over the same period 
delinquent loan levels declined across all loan portfolios 
we anticipate these positive trends will continue in  although at a slower rate compared to npas  nals  and tdrs this section should be read in conjunction with significant item and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents acl this section should be read in conjunction with significant item  and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we maintain two reserves  both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc 
combined  these reserves comprise the total acl 
our credit administration group is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation  as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl 
the alll represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date 
additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan risk rating downgrades  while reductions reflect charge offs  recoveries  decreased risk levels resulting from loan risk rating upgrades  or the sale of loans 
the aulc is determined by applying the transaction reserve process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation 
a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the acl to the level we have determined to be appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
the provision for credit losses in was million  compared with million in while the total acl balance declined in  and the resulting acl to loan coverage ratio declined to from  all of the acl coverage benchmarks improved as a result of the improvement in the underlying quality of the portfolio

the reduction in the acl compared with december   reflected declines in the alll in both the commercial and consumer portfolios 
the decline in the commercial portfolio alll reflected ncos on loans with specific reserves  and an overall reduction in the level of commercial criticized loans 
commercial criticized loans are commercial loans rated as olem  substandard  doubtful  or loss see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding loan risk ratings

table of contents compared with december   the aulc increased million primarily resulting from the downgrade of a commercial letter of credit associated with one relationship 
credit quality trends within the entire loan and lease portfolio steadily improved throughout and the acl to total loans ratio declined to at december   compared to at december  we believe the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio 
further  we believe that early identification of problem loans and aggressive action plans for these problem loans  combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to continued improvement in our key credit quality metrics 
however  the continued weakness in the residential real estate market and the overall economic conditions remained stressed  and additional risks emerged throughout these additional risks included the european banking sector stress  the continued budget issues in local governments  flat domestic economic growth  and the variety of policy proposals regarding job growth  debt management  and domestic tax policy 
continued high unemployment  among other factors  has slowed any significant recovery 
in the near term  we anticipate modest improvement in the unemployment rate  however we remain concerned that the us and local government budget issues will continue to negatively impact the financial condition of some of our retail and commercial borrowers 
the pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market that began in early has resulted in significantly lower residential real estate values 
we have significant exposure to loans secured by residential real estate and continue to be an active lender in our communities 
the impact of the downturn in real estate values has had a significant impact on some of our borrowers as evidenced by the higher delinquencies and ncos since late although there was improvement in  we believe the impact of reduced property values and the continued weak economic conditions will continue to negatively impact us 
given the combination of these noted factors  we believe that our acl is appropriate and its coverage level is reflective of the quality of our portfolio and the current operating environment 
ncos this section should be read in conjunction with significant item  and franklin related impacts located within the additional disclosures section 
any loan in any portfolio may be charged off prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred 
loss confirming events include  but are not limited to  bankruptcy unsecured  continued delinquency  foreclosure  or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment 
c i and cre loans are either charged off or written down to net realizable value at days past due 
automobile loans and other consumer loans are charged off at days past due 
first lien and second lien home equity loans are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral  less anticipated selling costs  at days past due and days past due  respectively 
residential mortgages are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral at days past due 

table of contents the following table reflects nco detail for each of the last five years

in assessing nco trends  it is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time 
the alll established at origination is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting 
as part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans  the loan is periodically reviewed and the risk rating is adjusted based on a current assessment of the borrower s financial position 
the alll is increased or decreased based on the revised risk rating 
in certain cases  the alll is determined to not be sufficient  and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow and collateral value of the specific loan 
charge offs  if necessary  are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established 
if the previously established alll exceeds that needed to satisfactorily resolve 
table of contents the problem loan  a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized 
consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans  although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans 
in summary  if loan quality deteriorates  the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building  followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized 
additionally  an increase in the alll typically either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals 
when a loan is classified as nal  it is evaluated for a specific alll or charge off 
as a result  an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncos 
home equity nco annualized percentages generally are greater than those of the residential mortgage portfolio primarily as a result of its second lien position 
this relationship changed substantially in and as the residential mortgage nco ratio significantly exceeded the home equity nco ratio in both years 
the nco annualized percentage in the home equity portfolio is the result of a higher quality borrower base as measured by fico distribution and a substantial portion of the growth representing first lien positions 
we believe that higher quality borrowers were attracted to the heloc product as a result of the relatively low interest rates associated with this variable rate product 
additionally  we accelerated the charge off policy associated with the residential mortgage portfolio in which shortened the maximum timeframe to charge off and  also during  we executed two npl sales in the residential mortgage portfolio with resulting charge offs 
we anticipate a return to the historical pattern of residential mortgage portfolio ncos being lower than the home equity portfolio ncos as exhibited in the second half of as we have focused on originating high quality home equity loans  we believe the pd risk is lower in the home equity portfolio 
however  the lgd component is significantly higher than the residential mortgage portfolio  which results in our projection for lower ncos in the residential mortgage portfolio relative to the home equity portfolio going forward 
therefore  we believe the residential mortgage nco rate will remain lower compared to the home equity portfolio as a result of the entire first lien composition of the residential mortgage portfolio  as well as the result of previous credit actions improving the underlying quality of these portfolios 
the home equity portfolio nco levels are not anticipated to increase compared to levels as a more significant portion of the portfolio is in a first lien position as described in table however  the home equity portfolio will continue to be impacted by borrowers that are seeking to refinance but are in a negative equity position because of the second lien loan 
right sizing and debt forgiveness associated with these situations are becoming more frequent as borrowers realize the impact to their credit is minor  and that a default on a second lien loan is not likely to cause them to lose their home 
from a delinquency standpoint  all residential mortgage loans greater than days past due are charged down to the estimated value of the collateral  less anticipated selling costs 
the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed  or the loan goes through the foreclosure process 
for the home equity portfolio  virtually all of the defaults represent full charge offs as there is no remaining equity  creating a lower delinquency rate but a higher charge off impact 
versus the million  or  decrease in c i ncos and the million  or  decrease in cre ncos primarily reflected significant credit quality improvement in the underlying portfolio as well as our on going proactive credit management practices 
there was not any concentration in either geography or project type 
based on asset quality trends  we anticipate lower levels of cre ncos in the future 
the million  or  decline in the automobile portfolio reflected our consistent high quality origination profile  as well as a stronger market for used automobiles 
home equity ncos declined million  or 
included million of franklin related ncos compared with no franklin related ncos in the current period 
excluding the franklin related impacts  home 
table of contents equity ncos decreased compared with although the performance of this portfolio continued to be impacted by the overall weak economic conditions and the continued decline of residential real estate property values  the performance was consistent with our expectations for the portfolio and we anticipate continued improvement 
residential mortgage ncos declined million  or 
included million of franklin related net charge offs  and included franklin related net recoveries of million 
excluding the franklin impacts  residential mortgage ncos decreased million compared with additionally  included million of ncos related to a change in charge off recognition policy see consumer credit section 
excluding these impacts  performance was consistent with our expectations for a continued downward trend in this portfolio 
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities 
we incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  credit spreads  and expected lease residual values 
we have identified two primary sources of market risk interest rate risk and price risk 
interest rate risk overview interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricing and maturities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities reprice risk  changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options  such as borrowers ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity option risk  changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a non parallel fashion yield curve risk  and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves  such as us treasuries and libor basis risk 
income simulation and economic value analysis interest rate risk measurement is performed monthly 
two broad approaches to modeling interest rate risk are employed income simulation and economic value analysis 
an income simulation analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of forecasted ise to changes in market rates over a one year time period 
although bank owned life insurance  automobile operating lease assets  and excess cash balances held at the federal reserve bank are classified as noninterest earning assets  and the net revenue from these assets is recorded in noninterest income and noninterest expense  these portfolios are included in the interest sensitivity analysis because they have attributes similar to interest earning assets 
eve analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of the values of period end assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
eve analysis serves as a complement to ise analysis as it provides risk exposure estimates for time periods beyond the one year simulation period 
the models used for these measurements take into account prepayment speeds on mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  and consumer installment loans  as well as cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
balance sheet growth assumptions are also considered in the ise analysis 
the models include the effects of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors  and other types of interest rate options 
the fomc s announcement of operation twist had the initial impact of lowering long term rates eg  rates with maturities greater than five years while slightly increasing intermediate term rates eg  rates with maturities of two to three years 
however  over time  both intermediate term and long term rates declined 
short term rates eg  rates with maturities of overnight through one year were not materially impacted by operation twist 
the impact to ise at risk was not material because short term rates were not materially 
table of contents impacted  and the impact of changes in intermediate term and long term rates takes a longer amount of time to be reflected in financial results 
the impact to eve at risk was meaningful because the impact of lower long term rates is reflected in higher mortgage asset prepayments 
higher mortgage asset prepayments has the effect of lowering eve at risk because the duration of assets declines while the duration of liabilities is not impacted 
the baseline scenario for ise analysis  with which all other scenarios are compared  is based on market interest rates implied by the prevailing yield curve as of the period end 
alternative interest rate scenarios are then compared with the baseline scenario 
these alternative interest rate scenarios include parallel rate shifts on both a gradual and an immediate basis  movements in interest rates that alter the shape of the yield curve eg  flatter or steeper yield curve  and no changes in current interest rates for the entire measurement period 
scenarios are also developed to measure short term repricing risks  such as the impact of libor based interest rates rising or falling faster than the prime rate 
the simulations for evaluating short term interest rate risk exposure are scenarios that model gradual and basis points parallel shifts in market interest rates over the next one year period beyond the interest rate change implied by the current yield curve 
we assumed market interest rates would not fall below over the next one year period for the scenarios that used the and basis points parallel shift in market interest rates 
the table below shows the results of the scenarios as of december   and december  all of the positions were within the board of directors policy limits as of december   except for the gradual basis point scenario 
ise at risk for the basis point scenario was compared to the policy limit of 
the board of directors approved an exception to the policy limit given that the likelihood of rates declining  or even  basis points has a low probability of occurrence as a mitigating factor for being outside the policy limit 
table net interest income at risk net interest income at risk basis point change scenario board policy limits december  december  the ise at risk reported as of december  for the and basis points scenario shows a significant change to a near term asset sensitive interest rate risk position compared with december  the alco s strategy is to be near term asset sensitive to a rising rate scenario 
the primary factors contributing to this change are the first quarter termination of billion of interest rate swaps maturing through june  offset slightly by billion of interest rate swaps executed in the second and third quarters  the impact of lower interest rates on mortgage asset prepayments  and low cost deposit growth 
the following table shows the income sensitivity of select portfolios to changes in market interest rates 
a portfolio with sensitivity would indicate that interest income and expense will change with the same magnitude and direction as interest rates 
a portfolio with sensitivity is insensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the basis points scenario  total interest sensitive income is sensitive to changes in market interest rates  while total interest sensitive expense is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
ise at risk for the basis points scenario has a near term asset sensitive interest rate risk position because of the larger base of total interest sensitive income relative to total interest sensitive expense

table of contents the following table shows the economic value sensitivity of select portfolios to changes in market interest rates 
the change in economic value for each portfolio is measured as the percent change from the base economic value for that portfolio 
for the basis points scenario  total net tangible assets decrease in value to changes in market interest rates  while total net tangible liabilities increase in value to changes in market interest rates 
eve at risk for the basis points scenario is liability sensitive because of the decrease in economic value of total net tangible assets  which reduces the eve  and the increase in economic value of total net tangible liabilities  which also reduces the eve

msr this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service billion in mortgage loans 
of this million  million was recorded using the fair value method  and million was recorded using the amortization method 
msr fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans  which can be greatly reduced by prepayments 
prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise 
we have employed strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment 
in addition  we engage a third party to provide valuation tools and assistance with our strategies with the objective to decrease the volatility from msr fair value changes 
however  volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these hedges 
we typically report msr fair value adjustments net of hedge related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income 
changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income 
msrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates  resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and  ultimately  impairment 
msr assets are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
price risk price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and subject to fair value accounting 
we have price risk from trading securities  
table of contents securities owned by our broker dealer subsidiaries  foreign exchange positions  equity investments  investments in mortgage backed securities  and marketable equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries 
we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio  the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained  and the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held by the insurance subsidiaries 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues  investor and customer perception of financial strength  and events unrelated to us  such as war  terrorism  or financial institution market specific issues 
in addition  the mix and maturity structure of huntington s balance sheet  amount of on hand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding  can have an impact on huntington s ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments 
we manage liquidity risk at both the bank and the parent company 
the overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations  and can maintain sufficient levels of on hand liquidity  under both normal business as usual and unanticipated stressed circumstances 
the alco was appointed by our board risk oversight committee to oversee liquidity risk management and establish policies and limits based upon analyses of the ratio of loans to deposits  liquid asset coverage ratios  the percentage of assets funded with noncore or wholesale funding  net cash capital  liquid assets  and emergency borrowing capacity 
in addition  operating guidelines are established to ensure that bank loans included in the business segments are funded with core deposits 
these operating guidelines also ensure diversification of noncore funding by type  source  and maturity and provide sufficient liquidity to cover of wholesale funds maturing within a six month period 
a contingency funding plan is in place  which includes forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages  including the implications of any credit rating changes and or other trigger events related to financial ratios  deposit fluctuations  debt issuance capacity  stock performance  or negative news related to us or the banking industry 
liquidity risk is reviewed monthly for the bank and the parent company  as well as its subsidiaries 
in addition  liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions  provide policy guidance  review funding strategies  and oversee the adherence to  and maintenance of  the contingency funding plans 
a contingency funding working group monitors daily cash flow trends  branch activity  unfunded commitments  significant transactions  and parent company subsidiary sources and uses of funds in order to identify areas of concern and establish specific funding strategies 
this group works closely with the alco and our communication team in order to identify issues that may require a more proactive communication plan to shareholders  employees  and customers regarding specific events or issues that could have an impact on our liquidity position 
in the normal course of business  in order to better manage liquidity risk  we perform stress tests to determine the effect that a potential downgrade in our credit ratings or other market disruptions could have on liquidity over various time periods 
these credit ratings have a direct impact on our cost of funds and ability to raise funds under normal  as well as adverse  circumstances 
the results of these stress tests indicate that at december   sufficient sources of funds were available to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations for the stress test scenarios include testing to determine the impact of an interruption to our access to the national markets for funding  a significant run off in core deposits and liquidity triggers inherent in other financial agreements 
to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures  we consider alternative sources of liquidity over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 
the specific alternatives for enhancing liquidity include generating client deposits  securitizing or selling loans  selling or maturing of securities  and extending the level or maturity of wholesale borrowings 
liquidity stress testing was also an important component of the fourth quarter annual capital planning process

at december   total wholesale funding was billion  a decrease from billion at december  the billion portfolio at december   had a weighted average maturity of years 
the bank has access to the federal reserve bank s discount window 
these borrowings are secured by commercial loans and home equity lines of credit 
the bank is also a member of the fhlb  and as such  has access to advances from this facility 
these advances are generally secured by residential mortgages  other mortgage related loans  and available for sale securities

table of contents upon receipt of the aforementioned trust preferred securities  huntington exchanged million of the trust preferred securities with the applicable trust for a like amount of debentures issued by us 
the debentures were surrendered to the applicable trustee for cancellation 
huntington anticipates exchanging the remaining million of trust preferred securities and retiring the related subordinated debt obligation in the first quarter of in addition  during the fourth quarter the parent company received million in funding from the bank based on the payment of intercompany subordinated debt 
the parent company also received million in dividends from the huntington investment company 
at december   the parent company had billion in cash and cash equivalents  compared with billion at december  appropriate limits and guidelines are in place to ensure the parent company has sufficient cash to meet operating expenses and other commitments over the next months without relying on subsidiaries or capital markets for funding 
on january   we announced that the board of directors had declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of per common share 
the dividend is payable on april   to shareholders of record on march  based on the current quarterly dividend of per common share  cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately million per quarter 
based on the current dividend  cash demands required for series a preferred stock are estimated to be approximately million per quarter 
cash demands required for series b preferred stock are expected to be approximately million per quarter 
based on a regulatory dividend limitation  the bank could not have declared and paid a dividend to the parent company at december   without regulatory approval 
we do not anticipate that the bank will request regulatory approval to pay dividends in the near future as we continue to build bank regulatory capital above its already well capitalized level 
to help meet any additional liquidity needs  we have an open ended  automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the sec  which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities 
with the exception of the common and preferred dividends previously discussed  the parent company does not have any significant cash demands 
there are no maturities of parent company obligations until  when a debt maturity of million is payable 
it is our policy to keep operating cash on hand at the parent company to satisfy any cash demands for the next months 
we sponsor a non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired or rehired prior to january  the plan provides benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels 
our policy is to contribute an annual amount that is at least equal to the minimum funding requirements 
the bank and other subsidiaries fund approximately of pension contributions 
although we contributed a total of million in  there was no required minimum contribution for funding requirements are calculated annually as of the end of the year and are heavily dependent on the value of our pension plan assets and the interest rate used to discount plan obligations 
to the extent that the low interest rate environment continues  including as a result of the federal reserve maturity extension program  or the pension plan does not earn the expected asset return rates  annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase and such increases could be significant 
any additional pension contributions are not expected to significantly impact liquidity 
see the contractual obligations table for our pension minimum funding requirement 
considering the factors discussed above  and other analyses that we have performed  we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we enter into various off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include financial guarantees contained in standby letters of credit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk based capital that the parent company and the bank are required to hold 
through our credit process  we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters of credit 
when it is probable that a standby letter of credit will be drawn and not repaid in full  losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses 
at december   we had billion of standby letters of credit outstanding  of which were collateralized 
included in this billion total are letters of credit issued by the bank that support securities that were issued by our customers and remarketed by the huntington investment company  our broker dealer subsidiary 
we enter into forward contracts relating to the mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from our mortgage loans held for sale 
at december   and december   we had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of million and million  respectively 
these contracts mature in less than one year 
we do not believe that off balance sheet arrangements will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources

table of contents operational risk as with all companies  we are subject to operational risk 
operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error  inadequate or failed internal systems and controls  violations of  or noncompliance with  laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  or ethical standards  and external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  and security risks 
we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws  rules  and regulations  and to improve the oversight of our operational risk 
for example  we actively and continuously monitor cyber attacks such as attempts related to efraud and loss of sensitive customer data 
we constantly evaluate internal systems  processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyber attacks and  to date  have not experienced any material losses 
to mitigate operational risks  we have established a senior management operational risk committee and a senior management legal  regulatory  and compliance committee 
the responsibilities of these committees  among other duties  include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns  risks  or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues 
both of these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee 
additionally  potential concerns may be escalated to our board risk oversight committee  as appropriate 
the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies  minimize operational and fraud losses  and enhance our overall performance 
representation and warranty reserve we primarily conduct our loan sale and securitization activity with fnma and fhlmc 
in connection with these and other securitization transactions  we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria  such as collateral type and underwriting standards 
we may be required to repurchase individual loans and or indemnify these organizations against losses due to a loan not meeting the established criteria 
we have a reserve for such losses  which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the reserves are estimated based on historical and expected repurchase activity  average loss rates  and current economic trends 
the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors  investor demand strategies and other external conditions containing a level of uncertainty and risk that may change over the life of the underlying loans 
we do not have sufficient information to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss related to representation and warranty exposure 
the tables below reflect activity in the representations and warranties reserve table summary of reserve for representations and warranties on mortgage loans serviced for others year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands reserve for representations and warranties  beginning of year assumed reserve for representations and warranties reserve charges provision for representations and warranties reserve for representations and warranties  end of year

successful disputes are a percent of close out requests 
make whole payments are payments to reimburse for losses on foreclosed properties 
foreclosure documentation compared to the high volume servicers  we service a relatively low volume of residential mortgage foreclosures  with approximately  foreclosure cases as of december   in states that require foreclosures to proceed through the courts 
we have reviewed our residential foreclosure process 
we have not found any evidence suggesting that any foreclosure by the bank should not have proceeded 
we have and are strengthening our processes and controls to ensure that our foreclosure processes do not have the deficiencies identified in the interagency review of foreclosure policies and procedures dated april  of federally regulated mortgage servicers 
compliance risk financial institutions are subject to a multitude of laws  rules  and regulations emanating at both the federal and state levels 
these broad based mandates include  but are not limited to  expectations on anti money laundering  lending limits  client privacy  fair lending  community reinvestment  and other important areas 
recently  the volume and complexity of regulatory changes have added to the overall compliance risk 
we have invested in various resources to help ensure we meet expectations  and we have a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance 
we require training for our colleagues for several broad based laws and regulations 
for example  all of our colleagues are expected to pass courses on anti money laundering and customer privacy 
those colleagues who are engaged in lending activities must also take training related to flood disaster protection  equal credit opportunity  fair lending  and or a variety of other courses related to the extension of credit 
we set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance 
capital this section should be read in conjunction with significant items and  and notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital is managed both at the bank and on a consolidated basis 
capital levels are maintained based on regulatory capital requirements and the economic capital required to support credit  market  liquidity  and operational risks inherent in our business  and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and new business opportunities

see non regulatory and capital ratios located in the additional disclosure section 
capital continued to strengthen as period end capital ratios improved compared to december  our tier common risk based ratio improved basis points to at december  this increase primarily reflected the combination of an increase in retained earnings and a reduction in the disallowed tax deferred asset  partially offset by an increase in risk weighted assets and the impacts related to the payments of dividends and the repurchase of the tarp warrants 
although not a regulatory capital ratio  the tier common risk based ratio has gained prominence with our regulators and investors 
the dodd frank act requires that any bank with assets over billion would be subject to additional scrutiny 
us regulators have identified such qualifying banks as sifis 
with billion in assets at december   we are at the lower range of the sifi group 
although we do not have sufficient 
table of contents information to know what the impacts will be to us  we believe that our current period end capital ratios are well positioned 
in december  the federal reserve issued a proposal to implement sections and of the dodd frank act that would enhance prudential standards on sifis 
the proposal uses or enhances requirements already imposed  or to be imposed  on sifis 
regulatory capital regulatory capital ratios are the primary metrics used by regulators in assessing the safety and soundness of banks 
we intend to maintain both our and the bank s risk based capital ratios at levels at which both would be considered well capitalized by regulators 
the bank is primarily supervised and regulated by the occ  which establishes regulatory capital guidelines for banks similar to those established for bank holding companies by the federal reserve board 
regulatory capital primarily consists of tier risk based capital and tier risk based capital 
the sum of tier risk based capital and tier risk based capital equals our total risk based capital

the bank had tier and total risk based capital in excess of the minimum levels required to be considered well capitalized of billion and billion  respectively  at december  
table of contents other capital matters beginning with the cash dividend declared on july   our quarterly cash dividend increased to per common share from per common share 
we consider disciplined capital management as a key objective  with dividends representing one component 
our strong capital ratios and expectations for continued earnings growth positions us to continue to actively explore additional capital management opportunities 
we are participating in the federal reserve s cappr stress test process and made our capital plan submission in january the federal reserve will evaluate our capital plan based on our risk profile and the strength of our internal capital assessment process under regulatory capital standards currently applicable and in accordance with our plans to address proposed revisions to the regulatory capital framework as set forth in basel iii and relevant provisions of the dodd frank act 
the federal reserve s evaluation will take into consideration any capital distribution plans  such as plans to increase common stock dividends or to reinstate common stock repurchase programs and we expect to receive the results of their evaluation by the end of the first quarter 
while we can give no assurances as to the outcome or specific interactions with the regulators  we believe we have a strong capital position 
business segment discussion overview we have four major business segments retail and business banking  regional and commercial banking  automobile finance and commercial real estate  and wealth advisors  government finance  and home lending 
a treasury other function also includes our insurance business and other unallocated assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
while this section reviews financial performance from a business segment perspective  it should be read in conjunction with the discussion of results of operations  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and other sections for a full understanding of our consolidated financial performance 
business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system  which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments 
the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and  accordingly  the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions 
optimal customer relationship ocr our ocr initiative is a cross business segment strategy designed to increase overall customer profitability and retention by deepening product and service penetration to consumer and commercial customers 
we believe this can be accomplished by taking our broad array of services and products and delivering them through a rigorous and disciplined sales management process that is consistent across all business segments and regions 
it is also supported by robust sales and cross referral technology 
ocr was introduced in late through  much of the effort was spent on defining processes  sales training  and systems development to fully capture and measure ocr performance metrics 
this year  we introduced ocr related metrics for commercial relationships  which complements the previously disclosed consumer ocr related metrics 
consumer ocr performance for consumer ocr performance there are three key performance metrics the number of checking account households  the number of product penetration per consumer checking account household  and the revenue generated 

table of contents the growth in consumer checking account number of households is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing checking account households 
the overall objective is to grow the number of households  along with an increase in product penetration 
we use the checking account since it typically represents the primary banking relationship product 
further  in our definition of a checking account household  we only count a product or service once 
we believe this is a better metric in that consumer behavior and loyalty are driven more by the variety of products used rather than just the number of products 
for example  a household that has one checking account and one mortgage  we count as having two services 
a household with four checking accounts  we count as having one service 
the household relationship utilizing two services is viewed to be more profitable and loyal  even though it has a smaller number of accounts 
the overall objective  therefore  is to decrease the percentage of services per consumer checking account household  while increasing the percentage of those with or more services 
the following table presents consumer checking account household ocr metrics table consumer checking household ocr cross sell report fourth third second first fourth number of households product penetration by number of services service services services total revenue in millions our emphasis on cross sell  coupled with customers increasingly being attracted by benefits such as hour grace on overdrafts and more recently the launch of asterisk free checking  are having a positive effect 
the percent of consumer households utilizing over four products at the end of the fourth quarter was  up from at the end of last year 
in  consumer checking account households grew at 
total consumer checking account household revenue in the fourth quarter was million  down million  or  from the third quarter  and down million  or  from the year ago quarter 
these declines were primarily driven by a decline in interchange revenue related to the implementation of the durbin amendment for the fourth quarter and the decline in the ftp related net interest income on core certificates of deposit 
commercial ocr performance for commercial ocr performance there are three key performance metrics the number of commercial relationships  the number of product penetration per commercial relationship  and the revenue generated 
the growth in the number of commercial relationships is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing commercial accounts 
the overall objective is to grow the number of relationships  along with an increase in product service distribution 
the commercial relationship is defined as a business banking or commercial banking customer with a checking account relationship 
we use this metric because we believe that the checking account anchors a business relationship and creates the opportunity to increase our cross sell 

table of contents the following table presents commercial relationship ocr metrics table commercial relationship ocr cross sell report fourth third second first fourth commercial relationships product penetration by number of services service services services total revenue in millions by focusing on targeted relationships we are able to achieve higher product service distribution among our commercial relationships 
our expanded product offerings allow us to focus not only on the credit driven relationship  but leverage these relationships to generate a deeper share of wallet 
the percent of commercial relationships utilizing over four products at the end of the fourth quarter was  up from at the end of in  commercial relationships grew at 
total commercial relationship revenue in the fourth quarter was million  down million  or less than  from the third quarter  and was up million  or  higher than the year ago quarter 
this was primarily driven by capital markets activities 
revenue sharing revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service 
fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to  or providing service to  customers 
results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations 
expense allocation the management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments 
expenses are allocated to business segments using a two phase approach 
the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activity based costs to activities related to product origination and servicing 
these activity based costs are then extended  based on volumes  with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products 
the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from treasury other 
we utilize a full allocation methodology  where all treasury other expenses  except those related to our insurance business  reported significant items except for the goodwill impairment  and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses  are allocated to the four business segments 
funds transfer pricing ftp we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments 
the intent of the ftp methodology is to eliminate all interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities 
the result is to centralize the financial impact  management  and reporting of interest rate and liquidity risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed 
the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment 
the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities  and includes an estimate for the cost of liquidity liquidity premium 
deposits of an indeterminate maturity receive an ftp credit based on a combination of vintage based average lives and replicating portfolio pool rates 
other assets  liabilities  and capital are charged credited with a four year moving average ftp rate 
the denominator in the net interest margin calculation has been modified to add the amount of net funds provided by each business segment for all periods presented 

table of contents treasury other the treasury other function includes revenue and expense related to our insurance business  and assets  liabilities  and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments 
assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance 
the financial impact associated with our ftp methodology  as described above  is also included 
net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity 
noninterest income includes insurance income  miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments  such as bank owned life insurance income and any investment security and trading asset gains or losses

this financial measure has been included as it is considered to be an important metric with which to analyze and evaluate our results of operations and financial strength 
other companies may calculate this financial measure differently 
going forward we do not intend to report a ptpp metric with our credit costs now returning to more normal levels 
risk factors more information on risk is set forth under the heading risk factors included in item a and incorporated by reference into this md a 
additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the risk management and capital discussion  as well as the regulatory matters section included in item and incorporated by reference into the md a 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference into this md a  describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time  and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below 
total allowance for credit losses our acl of billion at december   represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing on going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio 
in doing so  we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category  the financial condition of specific borrowers  the level of delinquent loans  the value of any collateral and  where applicable  the existence of any guarantees or other documented support 
we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date 
there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy  market conditions  or events adversely affecting specific customers  industries  or markets 
if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates  the risk profile of a market  industry  or group of customers changes materially  or if the acl is not appropriate  our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which  in turn  could have a material negative adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan charge offs 
any increase in our acl or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
huntington follows the fair value accounting guidance under asc and asc fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
a three level valuation hierarchy was established for disclosure of fair value measurements 
the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the three levels are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 

table of contents assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility 
assets measured at fair value include mortgage loans held for sale  available for sale and other certain securities  certain securitized automobile loans  derivatives  certain msrs  trading account securities  and certain securitization trust notes payable 
at december   approximately billion of our assets and billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value 
in addition to the above mentioned on going fair value measurements  fair value is also the unit of measure for recording business combinations 
at the end of each quarter  we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured 
as necessary  assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date 
the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy  as well as additional discussion regarding fair value measurements  can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
investment securities this section should be read in conjunction with the investment securities portfolio discussion and note and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
level analysis on certain securities portfolios our alt a  private label cmo  and pooled trust preferred securities portfolios are classified as level  and as such  the significant estimates used to determine the fair value of these securities have greater subjectivity 
the alt a and private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows  while the cash flows of our pooled trust preferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly 
these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties  and are used as a basis for impairment analysis 
these three portfolios  and the results of our impairment analysis for each portfolio  are discussed in further detail below alt a mortgage backed private label collateralized mortgage obligation cmo securities are collateralized by first lien residential mortgage loans 
the securities are valued by a third party specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and proprietary pricing model 
the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds  losses  recoveries  default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures  discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities  collateral structure types  and house price depreciation appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts 
pooled trust preferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions 
the collateral generally consists of trust preferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks  bank holding companies  and insurance companies 
a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio 
we engaged a third party specialist with direct industry experience in pooled trust preferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio 
relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 
table of contents certain other assets and liabilities which are not financial instruments also involve fair value measurements 
a description of these assets and liabilities  and the methodologies utilized to determine fair value are discussed below goodwill goodwill is an intangible asset representing the difference between the purchase price of an asset and its fair market value and is created when a company pays a premium to acquire the assets of another company 
we test goodwill for impairment annually  as of october  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
goodwill impairment exists when a reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis  using the same two step process as the annual testing  if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the first step step of impairment testing requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill to its carrying value to identify potential impairment 
for our annual impairment testing conducted during  we identified four reporting units with goodwill retail and business banking  regional and commercial banking  wealth advisors  government finance  and home lending wgh  and insurance 
auto finance and commercial real estate was not subject to impairment testing as it had no goodwill associated with the unit 
in addition  although insurance is included within treasury other for business segment reporting  it was evaluated as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing because it had its own separately allocated goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions 
for all four reporting units identified in the above paragraph  we utilized both income and market approaches to determine the fair value for each reporting unit 
the income approach was based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of balance sheet and income statement activity 
an internal forecast was developed by considering several long term key business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth  net interest margins  and efficiency ratios 
long term growth rates were estimated to assist in determining the terminal values 
the discount rates were estimated based on the capital asset pricing model  which considered the risk free interest rate year treasury bonds  market risk premium  equity risk premium  and a company specific risk factor 
the company specific risk factor was used to address the uncertainty of growth estimates and earnings projections of management 
for the market approach  revenue  earnings and market capitalization multiples of comparable public companies were selected and applied to each reporting unit s applicable metrics such as book and tangible book values 
the results of the income and market approaches are combined to arrive at the final calculation of fair value 
the aggregate fair market value of the reporting units compared with market capitalization indicated an implied premium of at september  a control premium analysis indicated that the implied premium was within range of overall premiums observed in the market place 
all four of the reporting units tested passed step the second step step of impairment testing is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass step step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
as none of the reporting units failed step  step was not applicable during testing 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions  and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 

table of contents due to the current economic environment and other uncertainties  it is possible that our estimates and assumptions may adversely change in the future 
if our market capitalization decreases  we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or prior to that time  if any changes constitute a triggering event 
the and interim and annual assessments discussed below were performed in a manner consistent with the process described above 
the assessments were based on our reporting units at that time 
annual impairment testing and interim evaluations in  we performed an annual assessment at october and interim evaluations of our goodwill balances at march and june no impairment was recorded in other interim and annual impairment testing during the first quarter  our stock price declined  from per common share at december   to per common share at march  many peer banks also experienced similar significant declines in market capitalization during this same period 
this decline primarily reflected the continuing economic slowdown and increased market concern surrounding financial institutions credit risks and capital positions  as well as uncertainty related to increased regulatory supervision and intervention 
we determined that these changes would more likely than not reduce the fair value of certain reporting units below their carrying amounts 
therefore  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the first quarter 
our first quarter interim testing determined that the regional banking and insurance reporting units goodwill carrying values exceeded their implied fair values of goodwill by  million and million  respectively 
as a result  we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of  million in the first quarter 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the second quarter related to the sale of a small payments related business completed in july no other goodwill impairment was required during the remainder of pension pension plan assets consist of mutual funds and our common stock 
investments are accounted for at cost on the trade date and are reported at fair value 
mutual funds are valued at quoted net asset value 
our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and is valued at the last reported sales price 
the discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to determine the benefit obligation and pension expense are both assumptions 
actual results may be materially different 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other real estate owned oreo property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at its estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the property s appraised value at the date of transfer  with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan charged to the alll 
subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are charged to noninterest expense 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of oreo are recognized in noninterest expense on the date of sale 
at december   oreo totaled million  representing a decrease compared with million at december  
table of contents income taxes and deferred tax assets income taxes the calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments 
we have two accruals for income taxes our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal  state  and local taxing jurisdictions  net of any reserve for potential audit issues  and is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet  our deferred federal income tax asset  reported as a component of accrued income and other assets  represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap  and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under the federal tax code 
in the ordinary course of business  we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and non income taxes 
the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws 
we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions 
in addition  we rely on various tax opinions  recent tax audits  and historical experience 
from time to time  we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities 
where appropriate  we have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position 
however  changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates  implementation of new business strategies  resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions  and newly enacted statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance 
such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and or results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets at december   we had a net federal deferred tax asset of million and a net state deferred tax liability of million 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  was considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  impairment should be recognized 
our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change 
if our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets  such assets may be impaired 
based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income  there was no impairment of the deferred tax assets at december  recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affect financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this md a and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions sky financial the merger with sky financial was completed on july  at the time of acquisition  sky financial had assets of billion  including billion of loans  and total deposits of billion
