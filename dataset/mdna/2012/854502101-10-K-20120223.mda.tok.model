segment profit amounted to million  or of sales  aside from these costs 
this segment profit rate reflects basis points of dilution from black decker and acquired companies  such that legacy stanley achieved a segment profit rate excluding merger and acquisition related charges 
the increase in the total segment profit amount is attributable to black decker and acquisitions which more than offset lower profits in the legacy stanley business 
the legacy stanley performance pertained to lower absorption from reduced sales volume  due to weak construction markets and the previously mentioned customer inventory correction  along with inflation that pressured the segment profit rate

the pro forma black decker sales were comprised of unit volume  negative price  favorable foreign currency translation and from an acquisition 
merger and acquisition related charges  primarily inventory step up amortization from the initial turn of the black decker and crc evans inventories  amounted to million in excluding the merger and acquisition related charges  segment profit was million  or of net sales  representing a robust basis point expansion of the segment profit rate 
this strong performance was enabled by the accretive impact of black decker and crc evans  along with favorable operating leverage and a reduced cost structure in the legacy stanley businesses 
over one third of the segment profit rate improvement pertains to the legacy stanley business and the remainder to the inclusion of black decker and crc evans 
restructuring activities at december  restructuring reserves totaled million 
a summary of the restructuring reserve activity from january  to december  is as follows in millions acquisitions net additions usage currency actions severance and related costs asset impairments facility closure other subtotal actions pre actions severance and related costs facility closure other subtotal pre actions total actions during  the company recognized million of restructuring charges associated with the merger  niscayah  and other acquisitions  relating to activities initiated in the current year

as a result of the niscayah acquisition  the company has assumed million of restructuring reserves recorded by niscayah prior to the acquisition as part of legacy cost reduction initiatives in in addition  the company continued to initiate cost reduction actions in that were not associated with the merger or other acquisitions  resulting in severance and related charges of million pertaining to the reduction of employees  and facility closure costs of million 
of the million recognized for actions  million has been utilized to date  with million of reserves remaining as of december  the company expects the vast majority to be utilized in pre actions for the year ended january  the company initiated restructuring activities associated with the merger and acquisition of stanley solutions de s curit ssds 
charges recognized in associated with these prior year initiatives amounted to million  offset by million of releases of reserves related to residual liabilities  which included million of reserve releases not associated with the merger and other acquisitions 
as of january   the reserve balance related to these pre actions totaled million 
utilization of the reserve balance related to pre actions was million in the vast majority of the remaining reserve balance of million is expected to be utilized in segments the million of charges recognized in includes million pertaining to cdiy  million pertaining to security  and million pertaining to industrial 
in addition to the restructuring charges described in the preceding paragraphs  the company recognized million and million of restructuring related costs in and  respectively  pertaining to the merger and other acquisition related activity 
all of these charges impact gross profit or selling  general and administrate expenses  and include accelerated depreciation and other charges associated with facility closures as well as certain integration related administration and consulting costs 
financial condition liquidity  sources and uses of capital the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available lines of credit under various credit facilities 
operating activities cash flow from operations was million in compared to million in  representing a million increase 
cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by merger and acquisition related charges and payments of million and million for and  respectively 
after adjusting for the impact of the decrease in merger and acquisition related charges and payments  cash flows from operations improved in by a net amount of million due to increases in earnings 
cash flow from operations reflects a continued focus on working capital receivables  inventories and accounts payable  resulting in million of inflows in and million of inflows in working capital turns improved to times excluding niscayah at december   as compared to times for  which reflects improvements in both days outstanding of accounts receivable and accounts payable  while inventory turns remained consistent 
the improvement in overall working capital turns reflects the process driven improvements from sfs 
sfs principles continue to be deployed across all businesses and regions to improve working capital efficiency over time 
in  cash flow from operations was million  a million increase compared to million in cash flows from operations improved in primarily due to an increase in various non cash expenses associated with the merger and the other acquisitions 
such expenses include  among other items  million of inventory step up amortization  a million increase in intangible asset amortization  and a million increase in other depreciation and amortization 
inflows from working capital receivables  inventories and accounts payable were million in  compared with inflows of million in the change from is driven by higher receivables and inventory associated with improved sales volume 
working capital turns improved to times at january  as compared to times for pro forma with black decker due to improvements in days outstanding accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
cash flow from operations in was also negatively impacted by approximately million in payments for merger and acquisition related items including million in discretionary cash contributions to improve the funded status of legacy black decker pension plans 
free cash flow management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity  as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners 
as previously discussed  operating cash flow was affected by million and million of merger and integration related charges and payments in and  respectively 
additionally  capitalized expenditures include million of merger and integration spending in free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service  other borrowing activity  discretionary dividends on the company s common stock and business acquisitions  among other items 
millions of dollars net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow when merger and acquisition related charges and payments  along with capital expenditures related to merger and acquisition activity  are added back to the company s free cash flow  the resulting amounts are  million in and million in based on its demonstrated ability to generate cash flow from operations as well as its strong balance sheet and credit position at december   the company believes over the long term it has the financial flexibility to deploy capital to its shareowners advantage through a combination of acquisitions  dividends  and potential future share repurchases 
investing activities cash flow used by investing activities was billion in compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of million in and cash flow used by investing activities of million in the majority of the increase in cash outflows is from business acquisitions in which totaled billion largely due to the company s acquisition of niscayah  as previously discussed 
aside from niscayah  the company completed nine other acquisitions in  the largest of which were infologix and microtec  which were purchased for million and million  respectively 
in the company expended million for ten acquisitions  mainly for crc evans within the industrial segment  and ssds and gmt within the security segment 
the cash flow provided by investing activities in also includes million of cash acquired as part of the merger 
during the company completed six acquisitions for million 
capital and software expenditures were million in  million in  and million in the increase in capital expenditures in was due to the previously mentioned million of merger and integration related capital expenditures  while the increase in is primarily due to nine and a half months of black decker purchasing activity 
proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses were million in  million in and million in the increase in reflects million of proceeds from the sale of three businesses 
the remaining activity relates to assets sold in the normal course of business 
net financial instrument investing outflows were million in compared with inflows of million in  pertaining to net investment hedge activity and million of interest rate swap terminations in following the merger 
financing activities cash flow used by financing activities was million in compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million in and cash flows used in financing activities of million in payments on long term debt amounted to million in  million in  and million in the repayments pertain to million of term notes that matured in june the repayments primarily relate to the maturing of the million term notes and the million of payments associated with the remarketing of the convertible notes 
net repayments of short term borrowings totaled million in  million in and million in in november  the company received million in proceeds from the million issuance of senior unsecured term notes with a fixed coupon rate 
the company used the proceeds from this offering to pay down commercial paper 
in  the company received debt proceeds of million relating to the million in senior unsecured term bonds with a fixed coupon rate 
in connection with this debt offering the company paid million for the termination of two forward starting floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
in  the company also completed a security offering of convertible preferred units the convertible preferred units which consisted of million of eight year junior subordinated notes the notes bearing interest at an initial fixed rate of per annum and million of five year forward purchase contracts the purchase contracts that obligate investors to purchase  shares of the company s series b convertible preferred stock the convertible preferred stock for a price of per share on november  the notes initially rank equal in right of payment with all of the company s other junior subordinated debt

simultaneous with the offering of the convertible preferred units  the company entered into capped call transactions equity options with counterparties 
the total premium paid in for the capped call transactions was million 
each of the capped call transactions has a term of approximately five years and in aggregate the transactions cover  subject to anti dilution adjustments  the maximum number of the company s common shares issuable upon settlement of the convertible preferred stock 
these transactions provide the company the right to buy shares of its own common stock from the counterparties at a strike price of per share  which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the convertible preferred stock  and also obligate the company to sell shares of its own common stock to the counterparties at a strike price of 
the capped call transactions may be settled by net share settlement or  at the company s option and subject to certain conditions  cash settlement  or physical settlement 
the value received by the company  if the capped call transactions are exercised when the company s common stock price is above subject to anti dilution provisions  will be utilized to offset the dilution that may occur should holders of the convertible preferred stock elect to convert 
refer to note h  long term debt and financing arrangements  for further detail 
cash payments for dividends were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash dividends in was primarily attributable to the increase in dividends per common share to per share  as announced in february which represents the th consecutive year of dividend increases 
the increase in cash dividend payments versus is due to higher shares outstanding stemming from the merger 
the company repurchased million of common stock in  million in  and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaled million in  million in and million in the company received million of cash proceeds in from the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts element of the equity units 
the remaining amounts in each year mainly relate to the exercise of stock options 
credit ratings and liquidity the company maintains strong investment grade credit ratings from the major us rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt average a  as well as its short term commercial paper borrowings 
there have been no changes to any of the ratings during failure to maintain strong investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the company s cost of funds  liquidity and access to capital markets  but would not have an adverse effect on the company s ability to access committed credit facilities 
in march  the company entered into a new four year billion committed credit facility the credit agreement 
in connection with entering into the credit agreement the company terminated the existing million amended and restated credit agreement 
additionally  the million day credit agreement dated as of march  expired in accordance with its terms on march  borrowings under the credit agreement may include us dollars up to the billion commitment or in euro or pounds sterling subject to a foreign currency sublimit of million and bear interest at a floating rate dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing 
repayments must be made on march  or upon an earlier termination date of the credit agreement  at the election of the company 
the company has not drawn on the commitments provided by the credit agreement 
in july  in connection with the niscayah acquisition  the company entered into a billion day credit facility facility 
borrowings under the facility may include us dollars or euros up to the commitment and bear interest at a floating rate dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing 
the facility decreased to million as per the terms of the agreement in december where it will remain until it expires in july  or upon an earlier termination date at the election of the company 
the company has not drawn on the commitments provided by the facility 
these credit facilities are designated to be liquidity back stops for the company s commercial paper program 
finally  in august  the company increased its commercial paper program from billion to billion 
as discussed in note j  capital stock  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item  in the third quarter of the company entered into a forward share purchase contract on its common stock which obligates the company to pay million to the financial institution counterparty not later than august  or earlier at the company s option  for the  shares purchased 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of december   comprised of million in the us and million in foreign jurisdictions 
as of january  cash and cash equivalents totaled billion  comprised of million in the us and billion in foreign jurisdictions 
concurrent with the merger  the company made a determination to repatriate certain legacy black decker foreign earnings  on which us income taxes had not previously been provided 
as a result of this repatriation decision  the company has recorded approximately million of associated deferred tax liabilities at december  current plans and liquidity requirements do not demonstrate a need to repatriate other foreign earnings 
accordingly  all other undistributed foreign earnings of the company are considered to be permanently reinvested  consistent with the company s overall growth strategy internationally  including acquisitions and long term financial objectives as demonstrated by the recent acquisition of niscayah 
no provision has been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of these undistributed foreign earnings 
however  should management determine at a later point to repatriate additional foreign earnings  the company would be required to accrue and pay taxes at that time 
contractual obligations the following summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity payments due by period millions of dollars total thereafter long term debt a interest payments on long term debt b operating leases inventory purchase commitments c deferred compensation marketing obligations derivatives d forward stock purchase contract e pension funding obligations f total contractual cash obligations a future payments on long term debt encompass all payments related to aggregate debt maturities  excluding certain fair value adjustments included in long term debt  as discussed further in note h  long term debt and financing arrangements 
b future interest payments on long term debt reflect the applicable fixed interest rate or the variable rate in effect at december  for floating rate debt 
c inventory purchase commitments primarily consist of open purchase orders to purchase raw materials  components  and sourced products 
d future cash flows on derivative instruments reflect the fair value as of december  the ultimate cash flows on these instruments will differ  perhaps significantly  based on applicable market interest and foreign currency rates at their maturity 
e the company is obligated to pay million to the financial institution counterparty to the forward stock purchase contract in august  and may elect to do so earlier 
see note j  capital stock  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
f this amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or  with respect to unfunded plans  necessary to fund current benefits 
the company has not presented estimated pension and post retirement funding in the table above beyond as funding can vary significantly from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets  actuarial assumptions  and curtailment settlement actions 
to the extent the company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities  the related amount will be included in the table above 
however  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the million of such liabilities at december   the company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when if at all amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities 
while there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of debt principal  tax obligations  the forward stock purchase contract and the equity purchase contract fees  payment of the other contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts indicated 
other significant commercial commitments amount of commitment expirations per period millions of dollars total thereafter us lines of credit short term borrowings  long term debt and lines of credit are explained in detail within note h  long term debt and financing arrangements  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
market risk market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments  currencies  commodities and other items traded in global markets 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  stock prices  and commodity prices 
exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company  through its global businesses  enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies 
the company s predominant exposures are in european  canadian  british  australian  and asian currencies  including the chinese renminbi rmb and the taiwan dollar 
certain cross currency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate cross border activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options  purchased options  collars  cross currency swaps and currency forwards 
the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection 
at times  the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables  predominately for affiliate transactions 
gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures  assets and liabilities being hedged 
management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities  and in certain cases  may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain un hedged 
the company has also entered into cross currency swaps and forward contracts  to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements 
management estimates the foreign currency impact from these financial instruments at the end of would have been approximately a million pre tax loss based on a hypothetical adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions  this effect would occur from depreciation of the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions  and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes 
the company does not hedge the translation of its non us dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries 
as mentioned above  the company routinely has cross border trade and affiliate flows that cause a transactional impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements 
the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars 
it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects 
aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure  transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take  for example  if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier 
management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact of a overall movement in exchange rates is approximately million  or per diluted share 
the effect of foreign currency translation on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was approximately favorable in  favorable in  and unfavorable in the company s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations  short term investments  and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio 
the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt  is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps  and cross currency swaps 
the company s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt and derivatives in the us and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates 
at december   the impact of a hypothetical increase in the interest rates associated with the company s floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses  particularly brass  nickel  resin  aluminum  copper  zinc  steel  and energy used in the production of finished goods 
generally  commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments  but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions  procurement driven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects 
the company experienced inflation  primarily commodity related  of approximately million and million in and respectively  while it experienced mild deflation in price erosion has also occurred in and  in addition to inflation  with the cumulative unfavorable impact exceeding million 
the impact of inflation is expected to continue in  with cost and pricing actions being aggressively pursued to offset any adverse impact on operations 
fluctuations in the fair value of the company s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the esop section of md a 
additionally  the company has million of liabilities as of december  pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is mark to market exposure 
the assets held by the company s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities  primarily global stocks and fixed income securities 
the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values  although such funding would occur over a period of many years 
in  and  there were million  million and million in investment returns on pension plan assets  respectively 
the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately million in the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk 
management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 
the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world 
there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 
the company s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity  including operating cash flows  are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal 
accordingly  based on present conditions and past history  management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur 
the company believes that its strong financial position  operating cash flows  committed long term credit facilities and borrowing capacity  and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments  to invest in the routine needs of its businesses  to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 
other matters employee stock ownership plan as detailed in note l  employee benefit plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company has an esop under which the ongoing us cornerstone and k defined contribution plans are funded 
overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released  among other factors 
the company s net esop activity resulted in expense of million in  expense of million in and income of million in the esop expense increased in compared to due to the merger of black decker us defined contribution plan into the esop in the esop income in stems from the suspension of the cornerstone benefits and the reduction of the k match  as a percentage of employee contributions  as part of cost saving actions 
esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company s common stock declines 
critical accounting estimates preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a  significant accounting policies 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty 
the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations 
in these cases  management uses its judgment  based on the surrounding facts and circumstances  to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
second  a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change  for example  due to the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company  estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 
inventories lower of cost or market  slow moving and obsolete inventories in the us are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market  while non us inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market 
the calculation of lifo reserves  and therefore the net inventory valuation  is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components 
the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stock keeping units skus to determine that these items are properly valued 
the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete and or slow moving inventories 
inventory items identified as obsolete and or slow moving are evaluated to determine if write downs are required 
the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost 
if it is determined that cost is less than market value  cost is used for inventory valuation 
if market value is less than cost  the company writes down the related inventory to that value 
if a write down to the current market value is necessary  the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value  or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose  and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin  also called the floor 
if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value  further write downs would be recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets 
the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc goodwill acquired goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
the company reported billion of goodwill  billion of indefinite lived trade names and billion of definite lived intangibles at december  management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc  segment reporting  or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of a reportable operating segment having similar economic characteristics 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its fair value  an impairment may exist 
an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 
the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model 
the key assumptions used are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections 
also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation are near term revenue growth rates over the next five years 
these assumptions contemplate business  market and overall economic conditions 
the fair value of indefinite lived trade names is also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model 
the key assumptions used include discount rates  royalty rates  and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales 
as required by the company s policy  goodwill and indefinite lived trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of based on this testing  the company determined that the fair value of its reporting units and indefinite lived trade names exceeded their carrying values 
the discount rates used in testing goodwill ranged from to 
the near term growth rates and perpetual growth rates  which varied for each reporting unit  ranged from approximately to and to  respectively 
management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flows valuation utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate in all reporting units 
the discount rate was decreased by basis points with no impairment indicated 
the perpetual growth rates were decreased by basis points with no impairment indicated 
based upon the company s annual impairment testing analysis  including the consideration of reasonably likely adverse changes in assumptions described above  management believes it is not reasonably likely that an impairment will occur in any of the reporting units over the next twelve months 
in the event that the company s operating results in the future do not meet current expectations  management  based upon conditions at the time  would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize profitability 
accordingly  the above sensitivity analysis  while a useful tool  should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment 
a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate 
defined benefit obligations the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions 
these assumptions  which are updated annually  include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  future salary increase rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the company considers current market conditions  including interest rates  to establish these assumptions 
discount rates are developed considering the yields available on high quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations 
the company s weighted average discount rates for the united states and international pension plans were and  respectively at december  the company s weighted average discount rate for both the united states and international pension plans was at january  as discussed further in note l  employee benefit plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors  which include its targeted asset allocation percentages  historic returns  and expected future returns 
for net periodic benefit cost the company s expected rate of return assumption was for both united states and international plans 
the company will use a expected rate of return assumption for net periodic benefit cost reflecting a relatively higher proportion of fixed income plan assets 
a basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase net periodic benefit cost by approximately million  pre tax 
the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  however  differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions  the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  and  if in excess of a specified corridor  amortized over future periods 
the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets 
accordingly  market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year 
the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million at december  a basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately million at december  the primary black decker u 
s pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late  as well as the only material black decker international plan  and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans 
as of december   of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen  the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions 
the company recognized million of defined benefit plan expense in  which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 
environmental the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites 
future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company s expenditures related to routine environmental matters 
the company s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 
as of december   the company had reserves of million for remediation activities associated with company owned properties as well as for superfund sites  for losses that are probable and estimable 
the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is million to million which is subject to change in the near term 
the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns 
liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized  using enacted tax rates  for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers all positive and negative evidence including  estimates of future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies  the reliability of tax loss carry forwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 
by contrast  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 
the company is subject to tax in a number of locations  including many state and foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required when calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next months 
these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters 
the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based on the most current available information  which involves inherent uncertainty 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
the company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note q  income taxes  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
risk insurance to manage its insurance costs efficiently  the company self insures for certain us business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally 
for domestic workers compensation  automobile and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company s products  the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses stop loss insurance and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates 
while different stop loss deductibles exist for each of these lines of insurance  the maximum stop loss deductible is set at no more than million per occurrence and million in the aggregate per annum 
the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company s specific loss history  actual claims reported  and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required 
risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims  as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value 
the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a maximum of years 
the company believes the liabilities recorded for these us risk insurance reserves  totaling million and million as of december  and january   respectively  are adequate 
due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 
warranty the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses 
the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime  while certain products carry no warranty 
further  the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues 
historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized 
adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available 
the company believes the million reserve for expected warranty claims as of december  is adequate  but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process  including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims  the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability 
the company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a product specific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both company initiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies

the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes  such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are off balance sheet 
these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility 
the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the million of rent expense recognized in fiscal as of december  the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were million and million  respectively
