item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  which should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
executive overview the following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in item a of this annual report 
product costs and supply the level of profitability in the retail propane  fuel oil  natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost 
the unit cost of our products  particularly propane  fuel oil and natural gas  is subject to volatility as a result of supply and demand dynamics or other market conditions  including  but not limited to  economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing 
we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and also purchase product on the open market 
we attempt to reduce price risk by pricing product on a short term basis 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to assure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
therefore  average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate with propane  fuel oil  crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions 
in addition  periods of sustained higher commodity prices can lead to customer conservation  resulting in reduced demand for our product 
seasonality the retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses  as well as the natural gas marketing business  are seasonal because these fuels are primarily used for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season from october through march 
the fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and approximately three fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between october and march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season 
we expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
to the extent necessary  we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to holders of our common units in the fourth quarter and following fiscal year first quarter 
weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products  in particular propane  fuel oil and natural gas  for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many of our customers rely heavily on propane  fuel oil or natural gas as a heating source 
accordingly  the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas  which can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures  as was the case with the fiscal heating season  will tend to result in reduced propane  fuel oil and natural gas consumption  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater consumption 

table of contents hedging and risk management activities we engage in hedging and risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply 
we enter into propane forward  options and swap agreements with third parties  and use futures and options contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex to purchase and sell propane  fuel oil and crude oil at fixed prices in the future 
the majority of the futures  forward and options agreements are used to hedge price risk associated with propane and fuel oil physical inventory  as well as  in certain instances  forecasted purchases of propane or fuel oil 
in addition  we sell propane and fuel oil to customers at fixed prices  and enter into swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices as a result of selling the fixed price contracts 
forward contracts are generally settled physically at the expiration of the contract whereas futures  options and swap contracts are generally settled in cash at the expiration of the contract 
although we use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of price volatility associated with priced physical inventory and forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
risk management activities are monitored by an internal commodity risk management committee  made up of five members of management and reporting to our audit committee  through enforcement of our hedging and risk management policy 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note summary of significant accounting policies included within the notes to consolidated financial statements section elsewhere in this annual report 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  employee benefit plans  self insurance and litigation reserves  environmental reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  asset valuation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of supervisors 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting estimates allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate our allowances for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts  as well as an estimated reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write offs 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
as a result of our large customer base  which is comprised of more than million customers  no individual customer account is material 
therefore  while some variation to actual results occurs  historically such variability has not been material 
schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts  provides a summary of the changes in our allowances for doubtful accounts during the period 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits 
we estimate the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate used to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the expected cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our future expense 
with other assumptions held constant  an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have an immaterial impact on net pension and postretirement benefit costs 
see liquidity and capital resources pension plan assets and obligations below for additional disclosure regarding pension benefits 
self insurance reserves 
our accrued self insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product  workers compensation and automobile insurance policies 
accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data 
for each unasserted claim  we record a self insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data 
our self insurance provisions are susceptible to change to the extent that actual claims development differs from historical claims development 
we maintain insurance coverage wherein our net exposure for insured claims is limited to the insurance deductible  claims above which are paid by our insurance carriers 
for the portion of our estimated self insurance liability that exceeds our deductibles  we record an asset related to the amount of the liability expected to be paid by the insurance companies 
historically  we have not experienced significant variability in our actuarial estimates for claims incurred but not reported 
accrued insurance provisions for reported claims are reviewed at least quarterly  and our assessment of whether a loss is probable and or reasonably estimable is updated as necessary 
due to the inherently uncertain nature of  in particular  product liability claims  the ultimate loss may differ materially from our estimates 
however  because of the nature of our insurance arrangements  those material variations historically have not  nor are they expected in the future to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
loss contingencies 
in the normal course of business  we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we record a liability for such matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
the liability includes probable and estimable legal costs to the point in the legal matter where we believe a conclusion to the matter will be reached 
when only a range of possible loss can be established  the most probable amount in the range is accrued 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
fair values of acquired assets and liabilities 
from time to time  we enter into material business combinations 
in accordance with accounting guidance associated with business combinations  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date 
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal 
estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment 
estimates most commonly impact property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  including goodwill 
generally  we have  if necessary  up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize our estimates of acquisition date fair values 
results of operations and financial condition record warm temperatures across much of the country had a significant negative affect on volumes sold and overall profitability during fiscal nonetheless  we had several notable achievements during fiscal  including i the completion of the inergy propane acquisition for approximately billion on august   including the subsequent issuance of approximately million common units in a secondary public offering  the net proceeds of which were used to fund a portion of the acquisition  ii the amendment and restatement of our revolving credit facility to a new five year facility at lower interest rates  as well as to increase the capacity under the facility by million  and iii for the sixth consecutive year  we funded all cash needs from cash on hand without the need to borrow under our revolving credit facility and ended the year with million of cash 
fiscal includes weeks of operations  compared to weeks in the prior year  and includes the results of operations for inergy propane for two months since the date of acquisition 
net income for fiscal amounted to million  or per common unit  compared to million  or per common unit  in fiscal earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for fiscal amounted to million  compared to million for fiscal adjusted ebitda as defined and reconciled below amounted to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal 
table of contents net income and ebitda for fiscal were negatively affected by several significant items  including i million in acquisition related costs associated with the inergy propane acquisition  ii a charge of million associated with a legal settlement reached during the fourth quarter of fiscal included within general and administrative expenses  iii a loss on debt extinguishment of million associated with the refinancing of our credit agreement  and iv a million non cash charge from a loss on disposal of an asset in our natural gas and electricity business 
net income and ebitda for fiscal included a million charge for severance costs associated with the realignment of our field operations 
retail propane gallons sold for fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in fiscal sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons compared to million gallons in the prior year 
as reported throughout fiscal  the most significant factor impacting volumes in both segments was the record warm weather experienced throughout most of the country  particularly during the critical heating months from october through march according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa  average temperatures as measured by heating degree days across our service territories during fiscal were warmer than normal and warmer than fiscal the impact of record warm temperatures on volumes sold was offset to an extent by the addition of propane and refined fuels volumes sold from inergy propane since august   which contributed million gallons of propane and million gallons of fuel oil and other refined fuels sold in fiscal revenues for fiscal year of  million decreased million  or  compared to the prior year  primarily due to the lower volumes sold and lower average propane selling prices 
cost of products sold for fiscal of million decreased million  or  compared to million in the prior year as a result of lower volumes sold and lower wholesale product costs 
cost of products sold in fiscal and included a million and million  respectively  unrealized non cash gain attributable to the mark to market adjustment for derivative instruments used in risk management activities which are excluded from adjusted ebitda in both periods 
average posted prices for propane during fiscal were lower than the prior year  while average posted prices for fuel oil were higher than the prior year 
combined operating and general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal year were million  or  higher than the prior year  primarily as a result of the inergy propane acquisition and the legal settlement referred to above  offset to an extent by lower variable compensation attributable to lower earnings and continued savings in payroll and benefit related expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense of million increased million  or  primarily due to the impact of the inergy propane acquisition 
net interest expense of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to the prior year as a result of higher debt levels associated with the financing for the inergy propane acquisition 
as we look ahead to fiscal  our anticipated cash requirements will increase compared to historical trends as a result of the inergy propane acquisition  and include i maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million  ii approximately million of interest and income tax payments  and iii approximately million of distributions to unitholders  assuming distributions at an annualized rate of per common unit paid in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal  and at an annualized rate of per common unit beginning with the distribution to be paid in respect of the first quarter of fiscal the expected increase in the annualized distribution rate to per common unit was previously announced by us on april  based on our current cash position  availability under the revolving credit facility unused borrowing capacity of million at september  and expected cash flow from operating activities  we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations

retail propane gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
the volume decline was more pronounced within our residential customer base as the impact of weather has a greater effect on our residential customers propane consumption  which  during the winter  is primarily for space heating 
the impact of record warm temperatures on volumes sold was offset to an extent by the addition of propane volumes sold from inergy propane since august   which contributed million gallons of propane gallons sold in fiscal average propane selling prices for fiscal decreased compared to the prior year due to lower wholesale product costs 
included within the propane segment are revenues from other propane activities of million for fiscal  which decreased million compared to the prior year 
revenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of million for fiscal decreased million  or  from million in the prior year  primarily due to lower volumes sold  partially offset by higher average selling prices associated with higher wholesale product costs

credit agreement our operating partnership has a credit agreement  as amended on january  and august  the amended credit agreement that provides for a five year million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility of which  million was outstanding as of september  and september  borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our operating partnership has the right to prepay any borrowings under the revolving credit facility  in whole or in part  without penalty at any time prior to maturity 

table of contents the amendment to the credit agreement on january  amended the previous credit agreement to  among other things  extend the maturity date from june  to january   reduce the borrowing rate and commitment fees  and amend certain affirmative and negative covenants 
on the date of the january  amendment  our operating partnership had borrowings of million outstanding under the revolving credit facility of the previous credit agreement  and rolled those borrowings into the revolving credit facility of the amended credit agreement 
in addition  at the time the january  amendment was entered into  our operating partnership had letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility of the previous credit agreement primarily in support of retention levels under its self insurance programs  all of which have been rolled into the revolving credit facility of the amended credit agreement 
on april   we received consents from the requisite lenders under the amended credit agreement to enable us to incur additional indebtedness  make amendments to the amended credit agreement to adjust certain covenants  and otherwise perform our obligations as contemplated by the inergy propane acquisition 
on august   our operating partnership executed an amendment to the amended credit agreement to  among other things  provide for i a million senior secured day facility and ii an increase in our revolving credit facility under the amended credit agreement from million to million 
on the acquisition date  our operating partnership drew million on the day facility  which was used to fund a portion of the inergy propane acquisition  including costs and expenses related to the acquisition 
we repaid the million of borrowings under the day facility on august  with the net proceeds from the public issuance of common units on august  the amendment to the amended credit agreement on august  also amended certain restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to our operating partnership and us  as well as certain financial covenants  including a requiring our consolidated interest coverage ratio  as defined in the amendment  to be not less than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter  b prohibiting the total consolidated leverage ratio  as defined in the amendment  of the partnership from being greater than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter 
the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio increases over time  and commencing with the second quarter of fiscal  such minimum ratio will be to the maximum consolidated leverage ratio decreases over time  and commencing with the first quarter of fiscal  such maximum ratio will be to as of september  the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and maximum consolidated leverage ratio was to and to  respectively 
we act as a guarantor with respect to the obligations of our operating partnership under the credit agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth therein 
the obligations under the amended credit agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of the personal property of the partnership  the operating partnership and their subsidiaries  as well as mortgages on certain real property 
in connection with the previous revolving credit facility  our operating partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million and an effective date of march  and termination date of june  under the interest rate swap agreement  our operating partnership will pay a fixed interest rate of to the issuing lender on the notional principal amount outstanding  effectively fixing the libor portion of the interest rate at 
in return  the issuing lender will pay our operating partnership a floating rate  namely libor  on the same notional principal amount 
the interest rate swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
in connection with the amended credit agreement  our operating partnership entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a june  effective date  which is commensurate with the maturity of the existing interest rate swap agreement  and a maturity date of january  under this forward starting interest rate swap agreement  our operating partnership will pay a fixed interest rate of to the issuing lender on the notional principal amount outstanding  and the issuing lender will pay our operating partnership a floating rate  namely libor  on the same notional principal amount 
the forward starting interest rate swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
as of september   our operating partnership had standby letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of million which expire periodically through september  therefore  as of september  we had available borrowing capacity of million under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents the amended credit agreement and the senior notes both contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to the operating partnership and the partnership  respectively  including i restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and ii restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
under the indentures governing the senior notes  the partnership is generally permitted to make cash distributions equal to available cash  as defined  as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter  if no event of default exists or would exist upon making such distributions  and the partnership s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  is greater than to we and our operating partnership were in compliance with all covenants and terms of the senior notes and the amended credit agreement as of september  debt origination costs representing the costs incurred in connection with the placement of  and the subsequent amendment to  long term borrowings are capitalized within other assets and amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective debt agreements 
during fiscal  we capitalized million and million for costs incurred in connection with issuance of new senior notes and the amendments to our amended credit agreement  respectively 
we recognized charges of million to write off unamortized debt origination costs associated with the amendment to our amended credit agreement on january  and the repayment of borrowings under our day facility 
other assets at september  and september  include debt origination costs with a net carrying amount of million and million  respectively 
the aggregate amounts of long term debt maturities subsequent to september  are as follows fiscal through fiscal  fiscal million  and thereafter billion 
partnership distributions we are required to make distributions in an amount equal to all of our available cash  as defined in the partnership agreement  as amended  no more than days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
available cash  as defined in the partnership agreement  generally means all cash on hand at the end of the respective fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the board of supervisors in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements 
these reserves are retained for the proper conduct of our business  the payment of debt principal and interest and for distributions during the next four quarters 
the board of supervisors reviews the level of available cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management 
on october   we announced a quarterly distribution of per common unit  or on an annualized basis  in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal payable on november  to holders of record on november  on april   we announced that our board of supervisors approved an increase in the annualized distribution rate to per common unit which represents an increase of per common unit  or  compared to our current annualized distribution rate 
the distribution at the increased rate will be effective for the quarterly distribution paid in respect of the first quarter of fiscal ending december  pension plan assets and obligations we have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which was originally designed to cover all eligible employees of the partnership who met certain requirements as to age and length of service 
effective january   we amended the defined benefit pension plan to provide benefits under a cash balance formula as compared to a final average pay formula which was in effect prior to january  our defined benefit pension plan was frozen to new participants effective january  and  in furtherance of our effort to minimize future increases in our benefit obligations  effective january   all future service credits were eliminated 
therefore  eligible participants will receive interest credits only toward their ultimate defined benefit under the defined benefit pension plan 
there were no minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal  or as of september  and september  the plan s projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million and million  respectively 
as a result  the net liability recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the defined benefit pension plan increased by million during fiscal  which was primarily attributable to an increase in the present value of the benefit obligation due to a general decrease in market interest rates  partially offset by the growth in the value of plan assets from investment earnings during fiscal 
table of contents our investment policies and strategies  as set forth in the investment management policy and guidelines  are monitored by a benefits committee comprised of five members of management 
the benefits committee employs a liability driven investment strategy  which seeks to increase the correlation of the plan s assets and liabilities to reduce the volatility of the plan s funded status 
the execution of this strategy has resulted in an asset allocation that is largely comprised of fixed income securities 
a liability driven investment strategy is intended to reduce investment risk and  over the long term  generate returns on plan assets that largely fund the annual interest on the accumulated benefit obligation 
however  as we experienced in fiscal and fiscal  significant declines in interest rates relevant to our benefit obligations  or poor performance in the broader capital markets in which our plan assets are invested  could have an adverse impact on the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan 
for purposes of measuring the projected benefit obligation as of september  and september   we used a discount rate of and  respectively  reflecting current market rates for debt obligations of a similar duration to our pension obligations 
during fiscal and fiscal  the amount of the pension benefit obligation settled through lump sum payments did not exceed the settlement threshold combined service and interest costs of net periodic pension cost  therefore  a settlement charge was not required to be recognized in either of those fiscal years 
during fiscal  lump sum pension settlement payments to either terminated or retired individuals amounted to million  which exceeded the settlement threshold of million for fiscal  and as a result  the partnership was required to recognize a non cash settlement charge of million during fiscal the non cash charge was required to accelerate recognition of a portion of cumulative unamortized losses in the defined benefit pension plan 
additional pension settlement charges may be required in future periods depending on the level of lump sum benefit payments made in future periods 
we also provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees 
partnership employees who were hired prior to july and retired prior to march are eligible for health care benefits if they reached a specified retirement age while working for the partnership 
partnership employees hired prior to july are eligible for postretirement life insurance benefits if they reach a specified retirement age while working for the partnership 
effective january   we terminated our postretirement health care benefit plan for all eligible employees retiring after march  all active and eligible employees who were to receive health care benefits under the postretirement plan subsequent to march  were provided an increase to their accumulated benefits under the defined benefit pension plan 
our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans are unfunded 
effective january   we changed our postretirement health care plan from a self insured program to one that is fully insured under which we pay a portion of the insurance premium on behalf of the eligible participants 
long term debt obligations and operating lease obligations contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due under our known contractual obligations as of september  dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and thereafter long term debt obligations interest payments operating lease obligations a self insurance obligations b other contractual obligations c total a payments exclude costs associated with insurance  taxes and maintenance  which are not material to the operating lease obligations 

table of contents b the timing of when payments are due for our self insurance obligations is based on estimates that may differ from when actual payments are made 
in addition  the payments do not reflect amounts to be recovered from our insurance providers  which amount to million  million  million  million  million and million for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter  respectively  and are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
c these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet and primarily include payments for postretirement and long term incentive benefits as well as periodic settlements of our interest rate swap agreement 
additionally  we have standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  in support of retention levels under our casualty insurance programs and certain lease obligations  which expire periodically through september  operating leases we lease certain property  plant and equipment for various periods under noncancelable operating leases  including of our vehicle fleet  approximately of our customer service centers and portions of our information systems equipment 
rental expense under operating leases was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are presented in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees certain of our operating leases  primarily those for transportation equipment with remaining lease periods scheduled to expire periodically through fiscal  contain residual value guarantee provisions 
under those provisions  we guarantee that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount upon completion of the lease period  or we will pay the lessor the difference between fair value and the guaranteed amount 
although the fair value of equipment at the end of its lease term has historically exceeded the guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is deemed worthless at the end of the lease term  is approximately million 
the fair value of residual value guarantees for outstanding operating leases was de minimis as of september  and september  recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued an accounting standard update to provide guidance on increasing the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
this update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of partners capital and requires that the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
early adoption of this updated guidance is permitted  and it becomes effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after december   which will be the first quarter of our fiscal year 
this update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income but will require the partnership to change its historical practice of showing comprehensive income within the statement of partners capital 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update allowing companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  as a result of the qualitative assessment  it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  a more detailed two step goodwill impairment test would be performed to identify a potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of loss to be recognized  if any 
the standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   which will be the partnership s fiscal year 
early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact the partnership s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and also purchase product on the open market 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
in addition  to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to ensure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
in certain instances  and when market conditions are favorable  we are able to purchase product under our supply arrangements at a discount to the market 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
we attempt to reduce commodity price risk by pricing product on a short term basis 
the level of priced  physical product maintained in storage facilities and at our customer service centers for immediate sale to our customers will vary depending on several factors  including  but not limited to  price  supply and demand dynamics for a given time of the year 
typically  our on hand priced position does not exceed more than four to eight weeks of our supply needs  depending on the time of the year 
in the course of normal operations  we routinely enter into contracts such as forward priced physical contracts for the purchase or sale of propane and fuel oil that  under accounting rules for derivative instruments and hedging activities  qualify for and are designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts 
such contracts are exempted from fair value accounting and are accounted for at the time product is purchased or sold under the related contract 
under our hedging and risk management strategies  we enter into a combination of exchange traded futures and options contracts and  in certain instances  over the counter options and swap contracts collectively  derivative instruments to manage the price risk associated with physical product and with future purchases of the commodities used in our operations  principally propane and fuel oil  as well as to ensure the availability of product during periods of high demand 
in addition  the partnership sells propane and fuel oil to customers at fixed prices  and enters into swap agreements to hedge a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices as a result of selling the fixed price contracts 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
futures and swap contracts require that we sell or acquire propane or fuel oil at a fixed price for delivery at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require  its holder to buy or sell propane or fuel oil at a specified price during a specified time period 
however  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of the product to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then market price and the fixed contract price or option exercise price 
to the extent that we utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risk and commodity prices move adversely in relation to the contracts  we could suffer losses on those derivative instruments when settled 
conversely  if prices move favorably  we could realize gains 
under our hedging and risk management strategy  realized gains or losses on derivative instruments will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold to customers at market prices  or delivered to customers as it pertains to fixed price contracts 
futures are traded with brokers of the nymex and require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term by physical delivery  and swap and options contracts are generally settled at expiration through a net settlement mechanism 
market risks associated with our derivative instruments are monitored daily for compliance with our hedging and risk management policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 

table of contents credit risk exchange traded futures and options contracts are guaranteed by the nymex and  as a result  have minimal credit risk 
we are subject to credit risk with over the counter forward  swap and options contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
we evaluate the financial condition of each counterparty with which we conduct business and establish credit limits to reduce exposure to the risk of non performance by our counterparties 
interest rate risk a portion of our borrowings bear interest at prevailing interest rates based upon  at the operating partnership s option  libor  plus an applicable margin or the base rate  defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus of or the agent bank s prime rate  or libor plus  plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is dependent on the level of the partnership s total leverage the total ratio of debt to ebitda 
therefore  we are subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate 
we manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swaps have been designated as a cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recognized in other comprehensive income oci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
at september   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a net liability of million  which is included within other current liabilities and other liabilities  as applicable  with a corresponding unrealized loss reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
derivative instruments and hedging activities all of our derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet at their fair values 
on the date that derivative instruments are entered into  we make a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current period earnings or oci  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we formally assess  both at the hedge contract s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in oci to the extent effective and reclassified into earnings during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings 
the mark to market gains or losses on ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges  and that do not meet the normal purchase and normal sale exemption  are recorded in earnings as they occur 
cash flows associated with derivative instruments are reported as operating activities within the consolidated statement of cash flows 
sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate our exposure to unfavorable market price changes in commodities related to our open positions under derivative instruments  we developed a model that incorporates the following data and assumptions a 
the fair value of open positions as of september  b 
the market prices for the underlying commodities used to determine a 
above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change and compared to the fair value amounts in a 
above to project the potential negative impact on earnings that would be recognized for the respective scenario 
based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for open futures and option contracts as of september  indicates an increase in potential future net losses of million as of september  the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio
