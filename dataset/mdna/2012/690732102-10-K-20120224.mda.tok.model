exit and realignment charges 
with the continuing consolidation of healthcare providers as well as their aggregation for the purpose of purchasing services  we are experiencing a trend of increasingly larger healthcare systems and integrated healthcare networks converting to our distribution and supply chain services 
these customers have a relatively lower gross margin profile because of their significant revenue and scale 
in response to this change in customer mix  we are making adjustments to our infrastructure to better align our service model for these customers  including the closure of two distribution centers in our actions resulted in total charges of million in  associated with exit activities and our organizational realignment

these expenditures included investments in leasehold improvements and warehouse equipment both for our distribution centers and third party logistics facilities  as well as investments in operational software improvements and certain customer facing technologies 
capital expenditures were million for  primarily related to relocating or expanding distribution centers for new distribution and third party logistics business  as well as continued investment in operational efficiency initiatives 
capital expenditures in also included investments in software for the continued implementation of voice pick and customer facing technologies and other technology infrastructure enhancements 
these capital expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of properties acquired from the burrows company burrows 
in  capital expenditures were million  primarily related to our strategic initiatives  including leasehold improvements and information technology systems for our third party logistics operations 
during  we also invested in infrastructure initiatives designed to improve operational efficiency in our operating units 
we installed automation equipment in certain large distribution centers where the high volume of low unit of measure business benefits the most from the use of such equipment through productivity improvements  such as an increase in the number of lines picked per hour 
in addition  we installed voice pick technology in distribution centers in these capital expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of properties acquired from burrows and the receipt of a million purchase price adjustment 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  million in  and million in in  we paid dividends of million  repurchased common stock under a share repurchase program for million of cash  and received proceeds of million as a result of the termination of interest rate swaps 
in  we paid dividends of million and financing costs of million 
in  proceeds of million from the sale of the dtc business  as well as cash from operating activities of continuing operations and discontinued operations  were used primarily to reduce our revolving credit facility by million  net of borrowings  and to pay dividends of million 
we received proceeds from exercises of stock options of million  million and million in  and although our stock options generally have an exercise period of years  we believe that this trend may not continue as we have not issued stock options since 
table of contents cash used by operating activities of discontinued operations was million for  associated with administrative costs  compared with million in  primarily associated with leased facilities of the discontinued dtc business 
planned capital expenditures 
in late  we initiated a multi year transformation of our information technology infrastructure to improve operational and data management efficiencies and customer service and to reduce future operating expense increases 
as part of this initiative  we have extended and amended our contract for outsourced information technology operations  which expires in december we anticipate that our capital expenditures will increase million to million for  as compared with  with resulting increases in depreciation and amortization targeted to begin in the second half of in addition  we are targeting expenses for it outsourcing and maintenance to decrease over the same timeframe  thereby offsetting the negative financial impact of these operational initiatives on our results of operations 
capital resources 
our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents and a revolving credit facility 
we have a million credit agreement with bank of america  na  wells fargo bank  na and a syndicate of banks which expires on june  the revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on the revolving credit facility  which is subject to adjustment quarterly  is based on  at our discretion  the london interbank offered rate libor  the federal funds rate or the prime rate  plus an adjustment based on our leverage ratio credit spread 
we are charged a commitment fee of between and basis points on the unused portion of the facility 
the terms of the agreement limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and require us to maintain ratios for leverage and interest coverage 
at december   the following financial institutions had commitments under the facility bank of america  na  wells fargo bank  na  suntrust bank  na  na bank national association  jpmorgan chase bank na  branch banking trust company  citibank na  comerica bank  fifth third bank  and pnc bank na we may utilize the revolving credit facility for long term strategic growth  capital expenditures  working capital and general corporate purposes 
if we were unable to access the revolving credit facility  it could impact our ability to fund these needs 
during  we had no borrowings or repayments under the revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million of letters of credit and no borrowings outstanding under the facility  leaving million available for borrowing 
based on our leverage ratio at december   the interest rate under the facility will remain unchanged at libor plus basis points at the next adjustment date 
we have million of senior notes outstanding  which mature in and bear interest at  payable semi annually on april and october the revolving credit facility and senior notes contain cross default provisions which could result in the acceleration of payments due in the event of default of either agreement 
we believe we were in compliance with our debt covenants at december  we paid quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding common stock at the rate of per share during  per share during  and per share during our annual dividend payout ratio for the three years ended december   was in the range of to 
in february  the board of directors approved a increase in the amount of our quarterly dividend to per common share 
we anticipate continuing to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future 
however  the payment of future dividends remains within the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors 
in february  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our outstanding common stock to be executed at the discretion of management over a three year period  expiring in february the program is intended to offset shares issued in conjunction with our stock incentive plan and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
during  we repurchased approximately  shares at million under this program 
we believe available financing sources  including cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures

while we believe that we will have the ability to meet our financing needs in the foreseeable future  changes in economic conditions may impact i the ability of financial institutions to meet their contractual commitments to us  ii the ability of our customers and suppliers to meet their obligations to us or iii our cost of borrowing 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements  including variable interest entities  which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity

other long term liabilities include estimated minimum required payments for our unfunded retirement plan for certain officers 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain long term liabilities  including deferred tax liabilities and post retirement benefit obligations  are excluded as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of payments for these items 
excludes certain contingent contractual obligations that are required to be paid in the event that performance targets specified by customer contracts are not achieved 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that relate to estimates that require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on our results due to changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions that could reasonably have been used 
our estimates are generally based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are judged to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
because of the uncertainty inherent 
table of contents in such estimates  actual results may differ 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates include allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable  inventory valuation  accounting for goodwill and long lived assets  self insurance liabilities  and supplier incentives 
allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable 
we maintain valuation allowances based upon the expected collectability of accounts and notes receivable 
the allowances include specific amounts for accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as customer bankruptcies and disputed amounts  and general allowances for accounts that may become uncollectible 
these allowances are estimated based on a number of factors  including industry trends  current economic conditions  creditworthiness of customers  age of the receivables  changes in customer payment patterns  and historical experience 
at december   accounts and notes receivable were million  net of allowances of million 
an unexpected bankruptcy or other adverse change in the financial condition of a customer could result in increases in these allowances  which could have a material effect on the results of operations 
inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made only at the end of the year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time 
lifo calculations are required for interim reporting purposes and are based on estimates of the expected mix of products in year end inventory 
in addition  inventory valuation includes estimates of allowances for obsolescence and variances between actual inventory on hand and perpetual inventory records that can arise between physical inventory dates 
these estimates are based on factors such as the age of inventory and historical trends 
at december   the carrying value of inventory was million  which is million less than the value of inventory accounted for on a current cost or first in  first out fifo basis 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
long lived assets  which are a component of identifiable net assets  include intangible assets with finite useful lives  property and equipment  and computer software costs 
intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of customer relationships and non compete agreements acquired through business combinations 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events occur or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in performing the impairment test  we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using valuation techniques which can include comparable multiples of the reporting unit s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and discounted cash flows 
the ebitda multiples are based on an analysis of current enterprise valuations and recent acquisition prices of similar companies  if available 
the carrying value of the reporting unit is then compared to its fair value to determine potential impairment 
goodwill totaled million at december  long lived assets  which exclude goodwill  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we assess long lived assets for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of an asset  or group of related assets  to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
at december   long lived assets included property and equipment of million  net of accumulated depreciation  intangible assets of million  net of accumulated amortization  and computer software costs of million  net of accumulated amortization 
we did not record any material impairment losses related to goodwill or long lived assets in however  the impairment review of goodwill and long lived assets requires the extensive use of accounting judgment  estimates and assumptions 
the application of alternative assumptions could produce materially different results 
self insurance liabilities 
we are self insured for most employee healthcare  workers compensation and automobile liability costs  however  we maintain insurance for individual losses exceeding certain limits 
liabilities are estimated for healthcare costs using current and historical claims data 
liabilities for workers 
table of contents compensation and automobile liability claims are estimated using historical claims data and loss development factors 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of existing claims change or historical trends are not indicative of future trends  then we may be required to record additional expense that could have a material effect on the results of operations 
self insurance liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for employee healthcare  workers compensation and automobile liability costs totaled million at december  supplier incentives 
we have contractual arrangements with certain suppliers that provide incentives  including operational efficiency and performance based incentives  on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
these incentives are recognized as a reduction in cost of goods sold as targets become probable of achievement 
supplier incentives receivable are recorded for interim and annual reporting purposes and are based on our estimate of the amounts which are expected to be realized 
if we do not achieve required targets under certain programs as estimated  it could have a material effect on our results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide credit in the normal course of business to our customers and are exposed to losses resulting from nonpayment or delinquent payment by customers 
we perform initial and ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for estimated credit losses 
we measure our performance in collecting customer accounts receivable in terms of days sales outstanding dso 
accounts receivable from continuing operations at december   were million  and dso at december   was  based on three months sales 
a hypothetical increase decrease in dso of one day would result in a decrease increase in our cash balances  an increase decrease in borrowings against our revolving credit facility  or a combination thereof of approximately million 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to our revolving credit facility 
we had no outstanding borrowings and million in letters of credit under the facility at december  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would result in a potential reduction in future pre tax earnings of approximately million per year for every million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
due to the nature of our distribution services  which generally include delivery of product to specified locations  we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices 
the price and availability of fuel fluctuates due to market conditions generally outside of our control 
increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations by increasing the costs we incur to deliver product  either through utilizing our own fleet or third party carriers 
fuel costs related to deliveries  excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges and activity based transportation fees  increased by approximately million in from we estimate that approximately million of this increase was related to increases in diesel prices 
we benchmark our diesel fuel purchase prices against the us weekly retail on highway diesel prices the diesel benchmark price as quoted on the website of the us energy information administration 
the diesel benchmark price averaged per gallon in  up from per gallon in accordingly  in we estimate that every cents per gallon increase in the diesel benchmark price reduced our operating earnings by approximately  our strategies for helping to mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices include the use of fuel surcharges  activity based pricing and hedging alternatives
