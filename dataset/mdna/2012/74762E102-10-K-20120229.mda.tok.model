item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting polices for a detailed discussion 

table of contents management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  cost of capital and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
fair value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow  market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches 
absent any impairment indicators  we perform our impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter 
if there is a decrease in market capitalization below book value in the future  this may be considered an impairment indicator 
in addition  we enter into various types of investment arrangements in the normal course of business  each having unique terms and conditions 
these investments may include equity interests we hold in business entities  including general or limited partnerships  contractual joint ventures or other forms of equity participation 
these investments may also include our participation in different finance structures such as the extension of loans to project specific entities  the acquisition of convertible notes issued by project specific entities or other strategic financing arrangements 
our equity method investments are carried at original cost and are included in other assets  net in our consolidated balance sheet and are adjusted for our proportionate share of the investees income  losses and distributions 
equity investments are reviewed for impairment by assessing whether any decline in the fair value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary 
in making this determination  factors such as the ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment and the inability of the investee to sustain future earnings capacity are evaluated in determining whether an impairment should be recognized 
any future impairments  including impairments of goodwill or intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions or impairments of any investments  would negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized 
our profitability and financial operations may be negatively affected by changes in  or interpretations of  existing state or federal telecommunications regulations or new regulations that could adversely affect our fiber optic licensing segment 
many of our fiber optic licensing segment customers benefit from the universal service e rate program  which was established by congress in the telecommunications act and is administered by the universal service administrative company usac under the oversight of the federal communications commission fcc 
under the e rate program  schools  libraries and certain healthcare facilities may receive subsidies for certain approved telecommunications services  internet access and internal connections 
from time to time  bills have been introduced in congress that would eliminate or curtail the e rate program 
passage of such actions by the fcc or usac to further limit e rate subsidies could decrease the demand by certain customers for the services offered by our fiber optic licensing segment 
the telecommunications services we provide through our fiber optic licensing segment are subject to regulation by the fcc  to the extent that they are interstate telecommunications services  and by state regulatory agencies  when wholly within a particular state 
to remain eligible to provide services under the e rate program  we must maintain telecommunications authorizations in every state where we operate  and we must obtain such authorizations in any new state where we plan to operate 
changes in federal or state regulations could reduce the profitability of our fiber optic licensing segment  and delays in obtaining new authorizations could inhibit our ability to grow our fiber optic licensing segment in new geographic areas 
we could be subject to fines if the fcc or a state regulatory agency were to determine that any of our activities or positions are not in compliance with certain regulations 
if the profitability of our fiber optic licensing segment were to decline  or if the business of this segment were to become subject to fines  our overall results of operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected 

table of contents the business of our fiber optic licensing segment is capital intensive and requires substantial investments  and returns on investments may be less than expected for various reasons 
the business of our fiber optic licensing segment requires substantial amounts of capital investment to build out new fiber networks 
in  our proposed capital expenditures for our fiber optic licensing business are approximately million to million  million of which is related to committed licensing arrangements as of december  although we generally do not commit capital to new networks until we have a committed license arrangement in place with at least one customer  we may not be able to recoup our initial investment in the network if that customer defaults on its commitment 
even if the customer does not default or we add additional customers to the network  we still may not realize a return on the capital investment for an extended period of time 
furthermore  the amount of capital that we invest in our fiber optic network may exceed planned expenditures as a result of various factors  including difficulty in obtaining permits or rights of way or unexpected increases in costs due to labor  materials or project productivity  which would result in a decrease in the returns on our capital investments if licensing fees for the network were committed and could not be renegotiated 
new or developing technologies or significant competition in any of our markets could also negatively impact the business of our fiber optic licensing segment 
if any of the above events occur  it could adversely affect our results of operations or result in an impairment of our fiber optic network 
we extend credit to customers for purchases of our services and may enter into longer term deferred payment arrangements or provide other financing or investment arrangements with certain of our customers  which subjects us to potential credit or investment risk that could  if realized  adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we grant credit  generally without collateral  to our customers  which include electric power utilities  natural gas and oil companies  telecommunications service providers  governmental entities  general contractors  and builders  owners and managers of renewable energy facilities and commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the united states and canada 
we may also agree to allow our customers to defer payment on projects until certain milestones have been met or until the projects are substantially completed  and customers typically withhold some portion of amounts due to us as retainage 
in addition  we may provide other forms of financing to our customers or make investments in our customers projects  typically in situations where we also provide services in connection with the projects 
our payment arrangements with our customers subject us to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors affecting our customers  including material changes in our customers revenues or cash flows 
these changes may also reduce the value of any financing or equity investment arrangements we have with our customers 
many of our customers have been negatively impacted by the recent economic downturn  and some may experience financial difficulties including bankruptcies that could impact our ability to collect amounts owed to us or impair the value of our investments in them 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us  our cash flows would be reduced and we could experience losses if the uncollectible amounts exceeded current allowances 
we would also recognize losses with respect to any investments that are impaired as a result of our customers financial difficulties 
losses experienced could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 
the risks of collectability and impairment losses may increase for projects where we provide services as well as make a financing or equity investment 
the loss of key personnel could disrupt our business 
we depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and on senior management of our operating units  including the businesses we acquire 
although we have entered into employment agreements with terms of one to three years with most of our executive officers and certain other key employees  we cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees  could negatively impact our ability to manage our business 
we do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees 

table of contents we may be required to contribute cash to meet our underfunded obligations in certain multi employer pension plans 
our collective bargaining agreements generally require us to participate with other companies in multi employer pension plans 
to the extent those plans are underfunded  the employee retirement income security act of  as amended by the multi employer pension plan amendments act of  may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated or experience a mass withdrawal 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a million liability when certain of our subsidiaries withdrew from an underfunded multi employer pension plan 
the amount of this liability is estimated based on information received from the multi employer plan in and the actual amount assessed by the plan for the withdrawal  which we do not expect the plan to provide us before  and the amount that we ultimately pay for the withdrawal liability may be materially different than the amount currently recorded 
in addition  the pension protection act of added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after for multi employer plans that are classified as endangered  seriously endangered  or critical status 
plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan  which may require additional contributions from employers which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions and or modifications to retiree benefits 
a number of multi employer plans to which we contribute or may contribute in the future are in endangered  seriously endangered or critical status 
the amount of additional funds we may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated  as such amounts will likely be based on future work that requires the specific use of union employees covered by these plans  and the amount of that future work and the number of employees that may be affected cannot reasonably be estimated 
should we provide in the future a significant amount of services in areas that require us to utilize unionized employees covered by these affected plans  causing us to make substantial contributions  or should a determination be made that additional plans to which any of our operating units contribute are in a classification that requires additional contributions  it could detrimentally affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows if we are not able to adequately mitigate these costs 
our unionized workforce and related obligations could adversely affect our operations 
as of december   approximately of our hourly employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although the majority of the collective bargaining agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages  certain of our unionized employees participated in a strike and work stoppage during january  and we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future 
strikes or work stoppages can adversely impact our relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue 
our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons 
for instance  our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire and some businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union based company 
additionally  we may increase our exposure to withdrawal liabilities for underfunded multi employer pension plans to which an acquired company contributes 
approximately of our hourly employees are not unionized 
under the current presidential administration  certain administrative and regulatory actions have been taken and are being considered that could create more flexibility and opportunity for labor unions to organize non union workers and could result in a greater percentage of our workforce being subject to collective bargaining agreements  heightening the risks described above 
in addition  certain of our customers require or prefer a non union workforce  and they may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our non union labor crews were to become unionized  which could negatively affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents we may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational impacts relating to occupational health and safety matters 
our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace 
while we have invested  and will continue to invest  substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs  our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure 
although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions  we have suffered fatalities in the past and may suffer additional fatalities in the future 
serious accidents  including fatalities  may subject us to substantial penalties  civil litigation or criminal prosecution 
claims for damages to persons  including claims for bodily injury or loss of life  could result in substantial costs and liabilities  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or we were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations  our customers could cancel our contracts and not award us future business 
risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects 
our international operations are presently conducted primarily in canada and australia  but we have performed work in various other foreign countries  and we expect that the number of countries in which we operate could expand significantly over the next few years 
economic conditions  including those resulting from wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts or volatility in the global markets  may adversely affect our customers  their demand for our services and their ability to pay for our services 
in addition  there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally  including  but not limited to  potential instability in international markets  changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international operations  currency fluctuations in foreign countries  political  economic and social conditions in foreign countries and complex us and foreign laws and treaties  including tax laws 
these risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers or to operate our international business profitably  and our overall business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by our foreign activities 
we could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities  including the us foreign corrupt practices act and other similar worldwide anti bribery laws 
the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit us based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption  and in certain circumstances  compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti bribery laws 
further  we require our partners  subcontractors  agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with the fcpa and other anti bribery laws 
although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we  our employees  our agents and others who work with us in foreign countries comply with the fcpa and other anti bribery laws  there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our agents  employees and intermediaries 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  detecting  investigating and resolving actual or alleged fcpa violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management 
we may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth and operations 
if we cannot secure funds in the future  including financing on acceptable terms  we may be unable to support our growth strategy or future operations 
we cannot readily predict the ability of certain customers to pay for past services  and unfavorable economic conditions  such as those experienced over recent years  may 
table of contents negatively impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us 
we may also use cash for acquisitions  as well as for investments  both of which are elements of our growth strategy  but we cannot readily predict the timing  size and success of our acquisition or investment efforts 
using cash for acquisitions and investments limits our financial flexibility and makes us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings 
our existing credit facility contains significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility  including our ability to incur additional debt or conduct certain types of preferred equity financings  and if we seek more debt  we may have to agree to additional covenants that limit our operational and financial flexibility 
if we seek additional debt or equity financings  we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all 
furthermore  our credit facility is based upon existing commitments from several banks 
banks have become more restrictive in their lending practices following the difficulties in the credit markets  and some may be unable or unwilling to fund their commitments  which may limit our access to the capital needed to fund our growth and operations 
in addition  we rely on financing companies to fund the leasing of certain of our trucks and trailers  support vehicles and specialty construction equipment 
credit market conditions may cause certain of these financing companies to restrict or withhold access to capital to fund the leasing of additional equipment 
although we are not dependent on any single equipment lessor  a widespread lack of available capital to fund the leasing of equipment could negatively impact our future operations 
additionally  the market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control  which will impact our ability to use equity to obtain funds 
a variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  including overall market conditions or volatility  a shortfall in our operating results from those anticipated  negative results or other unfavorable information relating to our market peers or the other risks described in this annual report on form k 
our participation in joint ventures exposes us to liability and or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners 
as part of our business  we have entered into joint venture arrangements and may enter into additional joint venture arrangements in the future 
the purpose of these joint ventures is typically to combine skills and resources to allow for the performance of particular projects 
success on these jointly performed projects depends in large part on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations 
we and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of our joint ventures 
if a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations  including liabilities stemming from claims or lawsuits  we could be required to make additional investments  provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner s shortfall 
further  if we are unable to adequately address our partner s performance issues  the customer may terminate the project  which could result in legal liability to us  harm our reputation and reduce our profit on a project 
we are in the process of implementing an information technology it solution  which could temporarily disrupt day to day operations at certain operating units 
we continue to implement a comprehensive it solution that we believe will allow for the interface between functions such as accounting and finance  human resources  operations  and fleet management 
continued development and implementation of the it solution will require substantial financial and personnel resources 
while the it solution is intended to improve and enhance our information systems  implementation of new information systems at each operating unit exposes us to the risks of start up of the new system and integration of that system with our existing systems and processes  including possible disruption of our financial reporting 
there is no guarantee that we will realize economic or other intended benefits from continued development and implementation of the it solution 
additionally  the it solution may not be developed or implemented as timely or as accurately as planned 
failure to properly implement the it solution could result in substantial disruptions to our business  including coordinating and processing our normal business activities  testing and recording of certain data necessary to provide oversight over our disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal controls over our financial reporting  and other unforeseen problems 

table of contents failure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations 
it solution failures  network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders  impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results  resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or our information  or damage to our reputation 
while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures  there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach particularly in light of our ongoing implementation of the it solution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
our dependence on suppliers  subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could expose us to the risk of loss in our operations 
on certain projects  we rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of our services 
we also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide us with the equipment required to conduct our operations 
although we are not dependent on any single supplier  subcontractor or equipment manufacturer  any substantial limitation on the availability of required suppliers  subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively impact our operations 
the risk of a lack of available suppliers  subcontractors or equipment manufacturers may be heightened as a result of recent market and economic conditions 
to the extent we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  we could experience losses in the performance of our operations 
fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our financial results as we expand into international markets 
for the year ended december   we derived million  or  of our consolidated revenues from foreign operations  the substantial majority of which was earned in canada 
we intend to expand the volume of services that we provide internationally 
as a result  our reported financial condition and results of operations may be more significantly exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations  which are denominated in local currencies  into the us dollar 
our business growth could outpace the capability of our decentralized management infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that our management infrastructure will be adequate to support our operations as they expand 
for example  the ability to internally communicate  coordinate and execute business strategies  plans and tactics may be negatively impacted by our increasing size and complexity 
a decentralized structure places significant control and decision making powers in the hands of local management 
this contributes to the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting key business matters than we would in a more centralized environment 
the lack of timely access to information may impact the quality of decision making by management 
our decentralized organization creates the possibility that our operating subsidiaries assume excessive risk without appropriate guidance from our centralized legal  accounting  tax  and treasury functions as to the potential overall impact 
future growth also could impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management  including the need to recruit and integrate new senior level managers and executives 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional managers and executives 
to the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively  or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management  we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan 
we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain surety bonds 
a portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds or other financial assurances 
current or future market conditions  including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies  as well as changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk  could 
table of contents cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew  or substantially reduce the amount of  bid and or performance bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs 
these actions could be taken on short notice 
if our surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding  our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other sureties  finding more business that does not require bonds or posting other forms of collateral for project performance  such as letters of credit or cash 
we may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all  which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances 
we have also granted security interests in various of our assets to collateralize our obligations to our sureties 
furthermore  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue or continue bonds on a project by project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds 
if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons  we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products  pcbs  fuel storage and air quality 
we perform work in many different types of underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil  some of which may contain pollutants 
these objects may also rupture  resulting in the discharge of pollutants 
in such circumstances  we may be liable for fines and damages  and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information 
we perform work in and around environmentally sensitive areas such as rivers  lakes and wetlands 
in addition  we perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture  resulting in the release of subsurface materials 
these subsurface materials may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
we also own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks that are above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in certain instances  we have obtained indemnification or covenants from third parties including predecessors or lessors for such clean up and other obligations and liabilities that we believe are adequate to cover such obligations and liabilities 
however  such third party indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs and the indemnitors may not pay amounts owed to us  and such unanticipated obligations or liabilities  or future obligations and liabilities  may have a material adverse effect on our business operations  financial condition or cash flows 
further  we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business 
there are also other legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions 
these proposals  if enacted  could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations  additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities  or other regulatory actions 
any of these actions could result in increased costs associated with our operations and impact the prices we charge our customers 
for example  if new regulations are adopted regulating greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks  we could experience a significant increase in environmental compliance costs in light of our large rolling stock fleet 
in addition  if our operations are perceived to result in high greenhouse gas emissions  our reputation could suffer 

table of contents opportunities within the government arena could subject us to increased governmental regulation and costs 
most government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process 
as we pursue increased opportunities in the government arena  management s focus associated with the start up and bidding process may be diverted away from other opportunities 
involvement with government contracts could require a significant amount of costs to be incurred before any revenues are realized from these contracts 
in addition  as a government contractor  we are subject to a number of procurement rules and other public sector regulations  any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties or a loss of business 
government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors 
government agencies may review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if government agencies determine through these audits or reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts  they will not reimburse the contractor for those costs or may require the contractor to refund previously reimbursed costs 
if government agencies determine that we engaged in improper activity  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  if a government agency were to even allege improper activity  we also could experience serious harm to our reputation 
many government contracts must be appropriated each year 
if appropriations are not made in subsequent years  we would not realize all of the potential revenues from any awarded contracts 
we may not be successful in continuing to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of has many requirements applicable to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting  including the requirements for management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion over the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
during  we continued actions to ensure our ability to comply with these requirements 
as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was effective  however  there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in future years 
failure to maintain effective internal controls or the identification of significant internal control deficiencies in acquisitions already made or made in the future could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock and our other publicly traded securities  the reduced ability to obtain financing  the loss of customers  penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements 
if we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights become obsolete  our competitive position could be adversely impacted 
we utilize a variety of intellectual property rights in our services 
we view our portfolio of proprietary energized services tools and techniques as well as our other process and design technologies as one of our competitive strengths  which we believe differentiates our service offerings 
we may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we also license certain technologies from third parties  and there is a risk that our relationships with licensors may terminate or expire or may be interrupted or harmed 
if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights  or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us  our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced 
in addition  if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete  we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings  and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers 
as a result  our business and revenue could be materially and adversely affected 
we may incur additional healthcare costs arising from federal healthcare reform legislation 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of were signed into law in the us this legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured 
the changes required by this legislation could cause us to incur additional healthcare and other costs  although we do not expect any material short term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation 
we are currently assessing the extent of any long term impact from the legislation  including any potential changes to this legislation 

table of contents certain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult 
the following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as currently in effect  as well as delaware law  could discourage potential proposals to acquire us  delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws  our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent  and we are subject to provisions of delaware law which prohibit us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder

item properties facilities we lease our corporate headquarters in houston  texas and maintain other facilities throughout north america and in various foreign locations where we conduct business 
our facilities are used for offices  equipment yards  warehouses  storage and vehicle shops 
as of december   we owned of the facilities we occupy  many of which are encumbered by a security interest under our credit facility  and we leased the remainder 
we believe that our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs 
equipment we operate a fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers  support vehicles and specialty construction equipment  such as backhoes  excavators  trenchers  generators  boring machines  cranes  robotic arms  wire pullers  tensioners  and helicopters 
our owned equipment and the leasehold interest in our leased equipment is encumbered by a security interest under our credit facility 
as of december   the total size of the rolling stock fleet was approximately  units 
most of our fleet is serviced by our own mechanics who work at various maintenance sites and facilities 
we believe that our equipment is generally well maintained and adequate for our present operations 
item legal proceedings we are from time to time party to various lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these actions typically seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  breach of contract and or property damages  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
with respect to all such lawsuits  claims and proceedings  we record a reserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  we disclose matters for which management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible
