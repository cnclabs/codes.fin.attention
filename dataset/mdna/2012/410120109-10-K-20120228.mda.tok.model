executive overview on june   hancock acquired all of the outstanding common stock of whitney holding corporation whitney  the parent company of whitney national bank based in new orleans  louisiana  in a stock and cash transaction 
whitney common shareholders received shares of hancock common stock in exchange for each share of whitney stock  resulting in hancock issuing million common shares at a fair value of billion 
whitney s preferred stock and common stock warrant issued under tarp were purchased by the company for million and retired as part of the merger transaction 
in total  the purchase price was approximately billion 
the fair value of the assets acquired  excluding goodwill  totaled billion  including billion in loans  billion of investment securities  and million of identifiable intangibles 
the fair value of the liabilities assumed was billion  including billion of deposits 
in september  seven whitney bank branches located on the mississippi gulf coast with approximately million in loans and million in deposits were divested in order to resolve branch concentration concerns of the us department of justice relating to the merger 
net income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from s net income of million 
this increase was primarily due to the addition of the whitney operations since the acquisition date  partially offset by merger related expenses 
diluted earnings per share for was  a decrease from s diluted earnings per share 
diluted earnings per share on operating income  which excludes tax effected merger related expenses and securities gains and losses  was for compared to for hancock s return on average assets roa for was compared to for  while the operating roa increased to in from in the provision for loan losses was million in compared to a provision of million in the prior year

net charge offs on non covered loans was percent of average loans 
this compares to the net charge off ratio of in the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december  from million recorded at december  substantially all of the million increase came from additions to the allowance for covered loans 
the determination of allowances for covered loans and other loans acquired with existing credit impairment is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents with the whitney acquisition  total assets increased billion during to billion at december  this included a billion increase in total loans to billion at december  in general  loan demand from the company s customer base continued to be restrained by economic conditions during  although some improvement was noted toward the end of the year 
loan trends will continue to be impacted as expected by declines in the fdic covered portfolio acquired with people s first at the end of excluding the impact of the whitney s deposit base  total deposits at december  were down slightly from december   reflecting in part the anticipated runoff of higher rate time deposits acquired in the people s first transaction 
including whitney  noninterest bearing demand deposits totaled billion  or of total deposits  at december   compared to billion  or of deposits  at the end of the increase reflects both the composition of the acquired whitney deposit base as well as customers response to the continued low market rate environment 
total stockholders equity increased billion during to billion at december   reflecting mainly both the value of the stock issued in the whitney transaction as well as the capital that was raised in the company s public stock offering in march hancock s regulatory capital ratios and those of its subsidiary banks remain above levels required to be considered well capitalized for various regulatory purposes 
results of operations net interest income net interest income te is the primary component of our earnings and represents the difference  or spread  between revenue generated from interest earning assets and the interest expense related to funding those assets 
for internal analytical purposes  management adjusts net interest income to a taxable equivalent basis using a federal tax rate on tax exempt items primarily interest on municipal securities and loans 
net interest income te for totaled million  almost double the million earned in earning assets in were up over  reflecting mainly the whitney acquisition  and the net interest margin improved by basis points to in the net interest margin  which is the ratio of net interest income te to average earnings assets  is an important metric used by hancock to manage net interest income 
the overall yield on earning assets decreased basis points to in loan yields increased basis points to in  while the yield on the investment portfolio declined basis points from positive adjustments to the yield earned on the acquired whitney portfolio based on post merger portfolio performance benefited the overall loan yield in both the lower yields available on the reinvestment of repayments and maturities from the company s mainly fixed rate investment portfolio  as well as the market yield on whitney s acquired investment portfolio at the acquisition date  contributed to the decrease in investment portfolio yield in the overall mix of average earning assets was relatively stable between and  with loans comprising approximately of the total in each year 
the overall cost of funding earning assets decreased basis points to in the overall rate paid on interest bearing deposits was down basis points from to in  reflecting mainly the impact of the sustained low rate environment on deposit rates and the expected runoff or re pricing of higher rate time deposits from people s first 
there was a favorable shift in the mix of funding sources during  related mainly to the composition of the acquired whitney deposit base 
interest free sources  including non interest bearing demand deposits  funded of average earnings assets in compared to in the impact of purchase accounting adjustments and the acquired deposit base should favorably affect the net interest margin in however  various factors could challenge our ability to increase net interest income and net interest margin 
for example  continued weak loan demand will make it difficult to grow earning assets and maintain or increase the proportion of loans in the earning asset mix 
the rates on many variable rate loans with rate floors currently exceed the underlying indexed market rates 
this will limit the benefit to loan yields from any rise in market rates 

table of contents net interest income te of million in represented an increase of million  or  from average earning assets increased between these years  related mainly to the peoples first acquisition in december the net interest margin increased basis points between these periods  as a basis point reduction in the overall cost of funds more than offset a basis decline in the yield on earning assets 
the decline in funding costs reflected mainly the impact of the low market rate environment on deposit rates  which declined basis points between these periods 
loan yields were relatively stable in compared to  but the re pricing of investment securities in the low rate environment reduced the yield on the investment portfolio by basis points 
the mix of earnings assets and funding sources were both relatively stable between and the factors contributing to the changes in net interest income te for   and are presented in tables and below

net charge offs on non covered loans in was of average loans 
this compares to a net charge off ratio of in the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december  from million recorded at december  substantially all of the million increase came from additions to the allowance for covered loans  although the impact on provision expense was only million net of the related increase in the loss share indemnification asset 
the covered loan provision in was negligible 
the determination of allowances for covered loans and other loans acquired with existing credit impairment is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses in was driven by a million reduction in net charge offs on originated loans as well as a slowdown in the identification of new problem loans due to the stabilization of the national and local economies 
the provision for loan losses reflects management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the amount of provision for each period is dependent on many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  identified loan impairment  management s assessment of the loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral  as well as  overall economic factors 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses as a percent of period end loans was at december  compared to at december  the allowance calculated on the loan portfolio that excludes covered loans and loans acquired at fair value in the whitney merger totaled million  or of this portfolio at december  these results compare to million and  respectively  for december  the provision for loan losses in increased million  or over major drivers of this increase were continued weakness in the local and national economies and increases in nonperforming loans 
net charge offs were million in  up slightly from the allowance for loan losses as a percent of period end loans was in compared to at december  noninterest income noninterest income for totaled million  or higher than in excluding the estimated impact of the acquired whitney operations  noninterest income was up million  or 
an million increase in on the accretion of the fdic indemnification asset related to the peoples first loss sharing agreements was the most significant factor 
changes in accretion on the indemnification asset will occur as projected losses on the related covered loan portfolio are reforecast periodically

the following discussion of changes in noninterest income for compared to excludes the estimated impact of acquired whitney operations in

the hancock segment coincides generally with the company s hancock bank subsidiary and the whitney segment with its whitney bank subsidiary 
each bank segment offers commercial  consumer and mortgage loans and deposit services 
although the bank segments offer the same products and services  they are managed separately due to different pricing  product demand  and consumer markets

note to the consolidated financial statements provide comparative financial information for the operating segments for  and net income in for the hancock segment increased million over net interest income increased million driven mainly by a lower cost of funds associated in part with the run off or re pricing of higher cost time deposits in the florida deposit base acquired with peoples first 
the provision for loan losses for the hancock segment declined million in  reflecting the improvement in certain credit quality metrics and general economic conditions  as discussed earlier 
the addition of whitney national bank s operations drove the significant changes in the whitney segment s operating results and financial position in compared to after deducting merger related expenses in excess of million  however  net income for for the whitney segment increased only million over balance sheet analysis securities available for sale our investment in securities was billion at december   compared to billion at december  at december   all securities were classified as available for sale

covered loans are those purchased in the december acquisition of peoples first  which are covered by loss share agreements between the fdic and the company that afford significant loss protection 
purchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date without carryover of any allowance for loan losses 
certain differences in the accounting for originated loans and for acquired performing and acquired impaired loans which include all peoples first covered loans are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total originated loans increased million from december  through year end associated mainly with customers of legacy whitney locations 
originated commercial loans were up million  reflecting in part some improvement in overall loan demand across the company s market areas toward the end of  seasonal demand from certain whitney customers and new customer development 
the whitney acquisition brought with it a relatively large base of commercial customers and a team of experienced commercial lending officers 

table of contents the company s commercial base is diversified over a range of industries  including oil and gas o g  wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products and the manufacture of such products  marine transportation and maritime construction  financial and professional services  and agricultural production 
loans outstanding to o g industry customers totaled approximately million at december   the majority of which are with customers who provide transportation and other services and products to support exploration and production activities 
the banks lend mainly to middle market and smaller commercial entities  although they do occasionally participate in larger shared credit loan facilities with familiar businesses operating in the company s market areas 
shared credits funded at december  totaled million  of which million was with o g customers 
originated construction loans  which include land development loans  and originated commercial real estate loans  which include loans on both income producing and owner occupied properties  increased a combined million in although the banks seek and are funding new loans on construction and commercial real estate projects  the availability of creditworthy projects continues to be limited following the weak economic conditions in recent years and a severe downturn in parts of the real estate market 
these conditions and the anticipated payoffs and scheduled payments on existing construction and commercial mortgage loans will limit the rate of growth in these portfolios 
approximately billion of the total billion in commercial real estate loans at december  is secured by properties used in the borrower s business 
the million increase in originated residential mortgage loans reflected mainly the incremental impact of whitney lending operations since the acquisition date 
the banks originate both fixed rate and adjustable rate home loans  although most fixed rate production is sold in the secondary mortgage market on a best efforts basis 
the portfolio of acquired whitney loans has decreased approximately million since the acquisition date  with million in the commercial category  million in the construction and commercial real estate categories  and million in the residential mortgage and consumer loan categories 
the required divestiture of certain whitney branches included approximately million of loans 
there were no significant trends underlying the reduction in the commercial category  although approximately million of commercial relationships with identified credit issues prior to the acquisition date were successfully resolved post acquisition 
reductions in the acquired construction and commercial real estate categories as well as the residential mortgage and consumer categories reflected mainly normal repayment and refinancing activity 
approximately million of loans with pre acquisition credit issues were paid off by the end of the covered loan portfolio decreased million reflecting normal repayments  charge offs and foreclosures

loans are placed on a non accrual status when payment in full  of principal or interest is not expected or the principal or interest has been in default for a period of days  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
all accrued but uncollected interest related to the loan is deducted from income in the period the loan is assigned a non accrual status 
for such period as a loan is in nonaccrual status  any cash receipts are applied first to principal  second to expenses incurred to cause payment to be made and lastly to the recovery of any reversed interest income and interest that would be due and owing subsequent to the loan being placed on non accrual status

non accrual loans were million at december   a decrease of million from december  covered and acquired loans accounted for in accordance with asc are considered to be performing due to the application of the accretion method 
these loans are excluded from the above table due to their performing status 
certain covered loans accounted for using the cost recovery method or acquired loans accounted for in accordance with asc are disclosed as non accrual loans 
covered loans accounted for using the cost recovery method totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
non accrual acquired loans accounted for in accordance with asc totaled million at december  included in non accrual loans is million in restructured commercial loans 
total troubled debt restructurings for the period were million 
loan restructurings occur when a borrower is experiencing  or is expected to experience  financial difficulties in the near term and  consequently  a modification that would otherwise not be considered is granted to the borrower 
the concessions involve paying interest only for a period of to months or extensions of maturity date 
we do not typically lower the interest rate or forgive principal or interest as part of the loan modification 
there have been no commitments to lend additional funds to any borrowers whose loans have been restructured 
troubled debt restructurings can involve loans remaining on non accrual  moving to non accrual  or continuing to accrue  depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower 
in accordance with accounting guidance  modified acquired credit impaired loans are not removed from a pool even if the loans would otherwise be deemed troubled debt restructurings 

table of contents the evaluation of the borrower s financial condition and prospects include consideration of the borrower s sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable period prior to the date on which the loan is returned to accrual status 
a sustained period of repayment performance generally would be a minimum of six months and would involve payments of cash or cash equivalents 
if the borrower s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured  the loan remains classified as a non accrual loan 
the amount of interest that would have been recorded on non accrual loans had the loans not been classified as non accrual was million  million  million  million and million for the years ended december     and  respectively

allowance for loan and lease losses management  with audit committee oversight  is responsible for maintaining an effective loan review system  and internal controls  which include an effective risk rating system that identifies  monitors  and addresses asset quality problems in an accurate and timely manner 
the allowance is evaluated for adequacy on at least a quarterly basis 
for a discussion of this process  see note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
we utilize quantitative methodologies to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and are of the opinion that the allowance at december  is adequate 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase in the allowance for loan losses during is primarily attributed to a million allowance on covered loans 
the increase was offset by a million increase in the fdic loss share indemnification asset 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses as a percent of period end loans was at december  compared to at december  the decrease in the allowance ratio is related to the addition of whitney s loan portfolio 
whitney s allowance was not carried forward at acquisition

average time deposits decreased million due mainly to the expected runoff of high priced deposits in the peoples first deposit base 
the banks have also adjusted the pricing of time deposits in light of low market rates  strong liquidity in the deposit base  and weak to moderate loan demand  particularly following the whitney acquisition

such instruments are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements until they are funded  although they expose the banks to varying degrees of credit risk and interest rate risk in much the same way as funded loans 
commitments to extend credit include revolving commercial credit lines  nonrevolving loan commitments issued mainly to finance the acquisition and development of construction of real property or equipment  and credit card and personal credit lines 
the availability of funds under commercial credit lines and loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract and has not violated other contractual conditions 
loan commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower 
credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower s credit quality deteriorates 
a number of commercial and personal credit lines are used only partially or  in some cases  not at all before they expire  and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the company 

table of contents a substantial majority of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the banks to fulfill a customer s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform 
the banks issue standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to their customers other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors of essential goods and services 
the contract amounts of these instruments reflect the company s exposure to credit risk 
the banks undertake the same credit evaluation in making loan commitments and assuming conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments and may require collateral or other credit support

diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of reducing the risks associated with economic fluctuations 
the banks have no significant concentrations of loans to particular borrowers or industries or any foreign entities 
the banks monitor real estate lending concentrations throughout the year  and do not have any commercial real estate concentrations  as defined by interagency guidelines 
the banks have actively decreased their exposure to residential construction development lending over the course of the last three years 
considering national housing trends  local market demand for housing  price softness in some markets  population migration trends  as well as general economic conditions  the company will continue to closely monitor this type of lending in the near future 
third party property valuations are obtained at the time of origination for real estate secured loans 
when a determination is made that a loan has deteriorated to the point of becoming a problem loan  updated valuations may be ordered to help determine if there is impairment  leading to a recommendation for partial charge off or appropriate allowance allocation 
the impairment on collateral dependent loans is measured against the property valuation less estimated selling costs 
selling costs are estimated based on the bank s actual experience with the disposition of similar properties 
loans that are risk graded as substandard or doubtful and are  and greater in size are required to have third party valuations performed annually to determine the extent of impairment and the need for loss allowances or charge offs 
property valuations are ordered through  and reviewed by  the bank s appraisal department consistent with regulatory requirements 
the bank typically orders an as is valuation for collateral property if the loan is in a criticized loan classification 

table of contents for loans under  but over  we use current loss statistics from sales of other real estate to discount prior property valuations as part of the ongoing assessment of the level of impairment in these real estate secured loans 
if  in the opinion of management  the value is still in question  it may be necessary to obtain a recertification of the appraisal on hand or obtain an updated or completely new appraisal 
new appraisals that indicate impairment are discussed monthly with management and appropriate provisions or charge offs are recognized promptly 
the bank maintains an active loan review function to help ensure that developing credit problems are captured and recognized in a timely manner 
further  an active watch list review routine is in place as part of the bank s problem loan management strategy and a list of loans days past due and still accruing is reviewed with management  including the chief credit officer  at least monthly 
recommendations flow from all of the above activities to recognize non performing loans and determine accrual status 
asset liability management asset liability management consists of quantifying  analyzing and controlling interest rate risk irr to maintain stability in net interest income nii under varying interest rate environments 
the principal objective of alm is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable risk limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of liquidity 
our net earnings are materially dependent on our net interest income 
irr on the company s balance sheets consists of reprice  option  yield curve  and basis risks 
reprice risk results from differences in the maturity  or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
option risk arises from embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options and interest rate options 
these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the company 
yield curve risk refers to the risk resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates and indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of the profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities  such as savings accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal accounts  and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates 
the asset liability committee alco manages our irr exposures through pro active measurement  monitoring  and management actions 
alco strives to maintain levels of irr within limits approved by the board of directors through a risk management policy that is designed to produce a stable net interest margin nim in periods of interest rate fluctuation 
accordingly  the company s interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by its alco  which oversees market risk management and establishes risk measures  limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
a variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk  the distribution of risk  the level of risk over time and the exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 

table of contents the company utilizes an asset liability model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates 
the model is used to perform net interest income nii  economic value of equity eve  and gap analysis 
the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next months and month periods 
the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates over the next months 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix  pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet 
the impact of interest rate derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  caps and floors  is also included in the model 
other interest rate related risks such as prepayment  basis and option risk are also considered 
the static gap report shown in table measures the net amounts of assets and liabilities that re price within a given time period over the remaining lives of those instruments 
at december   our cumulative re pricing gap in the one year interval was 
the asset sensitive position results from a deposit funding mix with significant balances in non interest bearing and core interest bearing transaction deposits along with a large asset position short term interest bearing investments and fed funds sold 
the earning asset position is strategically managed with a balance in our loan growth fixed versus floating and duration targets and securities portfolio cash flows 
we believe we are adequately positioned for the current rate environment 
the assumed prepayment of investments and loans was based on our assessment of current market conditions on such dates 
estimates have been made for the re pricing of savings  now and money market accounts 
actual prepayments and deposit withdrawals will differ from the following analysis due to variable economic circumstances and consumer behavior 
although assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or re pricing periods  reactions will vary as to timing and degree of interest rate change

table of contents net interest income at risk net interest income at risk measures the risk of a change in earnings due to changes in interest rates 
table presents an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in net interest income resulting from an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in the yield curve at december  shifts are measured in basis point increments in a range of as much as basis points through basis points presented in table from base case 
base case encompasses key assumptions for asset liability mix  loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds  deposit decay rates  securities portfolio cash flows and reinvestment strategy  and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios 
the base case scenario assumes that the current interest rate environment is held constant throughout the forecast period  the instantaneous shocks are performed against that yield curve 
table net interest income te at risk change in interest rates estimated increase decrease in nii december  basis points stable note decrease in interest rates discontinued in current rate environment these scenarios are instantaneous shocks that assume balance sheet management will mirror base case 
should the yield curve begin to rise or fall  management has strategies available to maximize earnings opportunities or offset the negative impact to earnings 
for example  in a rising rate environment  deposit pricing strategies could be adjusted to offer more competitive rates on long and medium term cds and less competitive rates on short term cds 
another opportunity at the start of such a cycle would be reinvesting the securities portfolio cash flows into short term or floating rate securities 
on the loan side the company can make more floating rate loans that tie to indices that re price more frequently  such as libor london interbank offered rate and make fewer fixed rate loans 
finally  there are a number of hedge strategies by which management could use derivatives  including swaps and purchased ceilings  to lock in net interest margin protection 
even if interest rates change in the designated amounts  there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as anticipated 
additionally  a change in the us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the us treasury yield curve would cause significantly different changes to nii than indicated above 
strategic management of our balance sheet and earnings is fluid and would be adjusted to accommodate these movements 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented above 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re pricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets such as adjustable rate loans have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
also  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
we consider all of these factors in monitoring exposure to interest rate risk 

table of contents liquidity liquidity management encompasses our ability to ensure that funds are available to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while also ensuring that we have adequate cash flow to meet our various needs  including operating  strategic and capital 
without proper liquidity management  we would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would not be able to meet the needs of the communities in which we have a presence and serve 
in addition  the parent holding company s principal source of liquidity is dividends from its subsidiary banks 
liquidity is required at the parent holding company level for the purpose of paying dividends to stockholders  servicing of any debt we may have  business combinations as well as general corporate expenses 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments  maturities of investment securities and occasional sales of various assets 
short term investments such as federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks are additional sources of liquidity funding

the following discussion highlights recent factors impacting hancock s results of operations and financial position 
total loans at december  were billion  an increase of million  or from september  the linked quarter increase reflected growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio and in the residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios 
linked quarter declines in both construction and commercial real estate loans reflected in part anticipated payoffs and scheduled payments in excess of new loans funded 
after adjusting for the million decline in the fdic covered peoples first portfolio during the fourth quarter  total loans increased million 
total deposits at december  were billion  up million  or from september  the linked quarter increase reflected year end seasonality of both commercial and public fund customers 
historically  both legacy hancock and legacy whitney customers have built deposits at year end  with some of those deposits leaving in the first quarter  particularly in demand deposits 
demand deposits comprised of total deposits at year end compared to at september  interest bearing public fund deposits totaled billion at year end  up million  or  from september  the increase was mainly related to seasonal tax collections toward year end 
time deposits decreased million during the fourth quarter of with approximately million from the anticipated runoff in the peoples first deposit base 
in the current low rate environment management continues to expect customers will be motivated to hold funds in no or low cost transaction accounts until rates begin to rise

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting principles we follow and the methods for applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and with general practices followed by the banking industry 
the significant accounting principles and practices we follow are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these principles and practices requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate the estimates and assumptions we make on an ongoing basis to help ensure that the resulting reported amounts reflect management s best estimates and judgments given current facts and circumstances dictate 
the following discusses certain critical accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in producing estimates that may significantly affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes 
acquisition accounting acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
purchased assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and assumed liabilities are recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values 
management applies various valuation methodologies to these assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued 
examples of such items include loans  deposits  identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in business combinations 
management uses significant estimates and assumption to value such items  including  among others  projected cash flows  repayment rates  default rates and losses assuming default  discount rates  and realizable collateral values 
the purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments also determine the amount of goodwill or bargain purchase gain recognized in connection with the business combination 
certain assumptions and estimates must be updated regularly in connection with the ongoing accounting for purchased loans 
valuation assumptions and estimates may also have to be revisited in connection with periodic assessments of possible value impairment  including impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and certain other long lived assets 
the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results  which could have material positive or negative effects on the company s results of operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the amount which  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating inherent losses  management applies judgment and assumptions to project the amount and timing of future cash flows  collateral values and other factors used to assess the borrowers ability to repay their obligations 
historical loss trends are also considered  as are economic conditions  industry trends  portfolio trends and borrower specific financial information 
although we believe we have identified appropriate factors for review and designed and implemented adequate procedures to support our estimation process  the allowance remains an estimate about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
changes in the circumstances considered when management develops its judgments and assumptions can materially impact the allowance estimate  potentially subjecting the company to significant earnings volatility 

table of contents accounting for retirement benefits management makes a variety of assumptions in applying principles that govern the accounting for benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
these assumptions are essential to the actuarial valuation that determines the amounts recognized and certain disclosures it makes in the consolidated financial statements related to the operation of these plans 
two of the more significant assumptions concern the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate needed to discount projected benefits to their present value 
changes in these assumptions impact the cost of retirement benefits recognized in net income and comprehensive income 
certain assumptions are closely tied to current conditions and are generally revised at each measurement date 
for example  the discount rate is reset annually with reference to market yields on high quality fixed income investments 
other assumptions  such as the rate of return on assets  are determined  in part  with reference to historical and expected conditions over time and are not as susceptible to frequent revision 
holding other factors constant  the cost of retirement benefits will move opposite to changes in either the discount rate or the rate of return on assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides further discussion on the accounting for hancock s retirement and employee benefit plans and the estimates used in determining the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit expense
