item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risk to kcs 
interest rate sensitivity 
floating rate indebtedness totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company s revolving credit facilities and term loan facilities contain variable rate debt that accrues interest based on target interest indexes london interbank offered rate libor or an alternative base rate plus an applicable spread 
given the balance of million of variable rate debt at december   kcs is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  a hypothetical basis points increase in each of the respective target interest indexes would result in additional interest expense of million on an annualized basis for the floating rate instruments issued by the company as of december  based upon the borrowing rates available to kcs and its subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average maturities  the fair value of debt was approximately  million and  million at december  and  respectively  compared with a carrying value of  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
commodity price sensitivity 
kcs periodically participates in diesel fuel purchase commitment and swap transactions 
at december  and  kcs did not have any outstanding fuel swap agreements 
the company also holds fuel inventories for use in operations 
these inventories are not material to kcs s overall financial position 
fuel costs are expected to reflect market conditions in  however  fuel costs are unpredictable and subject to a variety of factors outside the company s control 
assuming annual consumption of million gallons  a cent change in the price per gallon of fuel would cause a million change in operating expenses 
kcs is able to reduce the impact of increased fuel costs through fuel surcharge revenues from customers 
foreign exchange sensitivity 
while kcs s foreign subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency  a portion of the foreign subsidiaries revenues and expenses are denominated in mexican pesos 
based on the volume of revenue and expense transactions denominated in mexican pesos  revenue and expense fluctuations generally offset  with insignificant net impacts to operating income 
the company has exposure to fluctuations in the value of the mexican peso against the us dollar due to its net monetary assets that are denominated in mexican pesos 
for example  a hypothetical increase in the mexican peso to the us dollar exchange rate on net peso denominated monetary assets of ps 
million at december   would result in a foreign exchange loss of approximately million  and a decrease in the exchange rate would result in a foreign exchange gain of approximately million 
for income taxes paid in mexico  which are paid in mexican pesos  the revaluation of us denominated amounts primarily debt into mexican pesos is taxed currently under mexican tax law 
if the exchange rate used at the end of increased from ps 
per us dollar to ps 
per us dollar  income tax expense for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million
