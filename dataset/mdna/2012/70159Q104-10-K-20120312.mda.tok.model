fee based real estate services are offered through wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  which in total manage and or lease approximately million square feet for third party owners at march  unless otherwise indicated  all references to square feet represent net rentable area 
occupancy 
parkway s revenues are dependent on the occupancy of its office buildings 
at january   occupancy of parkway s office portfolio was compared to at october  and at january  adjusting january  occupancy to be reflective of core properties owned at march   occupancy of parkway s core portfolio would have been 
parkway currently projects an average annual occupancy range of to during for its office properties 
to combat rising vacancy  parkway utilizes innovative approaches to produce new leases 
these include the broker bill of rights  a short form service agreement and customer advocacy programs which are models in the industry and have historically helped the company maintain occupancy over time 
during the fourth quarter of  leases were renewed totaling  rentable square feet at an average rent per square foot of  representing a rate decrease  and at an average cost of per square foot per year of the lease term

rental rates 
an increase in vacancy rates in a market or at a specific property has the effect of reducing market rental rates and vice versa 
parkway s leases typically have three to seven year terms  though the company does enter into leases with terms that are either shorter or longer than that typical range 
as leases expire  the company seeks to replace the existing leases with new leases at the current market rental rate 
for parkway s core properties owned as of march   management estimates that it has approximately per square foot in rental rate embedded loss in its office property leases 
embedded loss is defined as the difference between the weighted average in place cash rents including operating expense reimbursements and the weighted average estimated market rental rate 
customer retention 
keeping existing customers is important as high customer retention leads to increased occupancy  less downtime between leases  and reduced leasing costs 
parkway estimates that it costs five to six times more to replace an existing customer with a new one than to retain the existing customer 
in making this estimate  parkway takes into account the sum of revenue lost during downtime on the space plus leasing costs  which typically rise as market vacancies increase 
therefore  parkway focuses a great amount of energy on customer retention 
parkway s operating philosophy is based on the premise that it is in the customer retention business 
parkway seeks to retain its customers by continually focusing on operations at its office properties 
the company believes in providing superior customer service  hiring  training  retaining and empowering each employee  and creating an environment of open communication both internally and externally with customers and stockholders 
over the past ten years  parkway maintained an average customer retention rate 
parkway s customer retention rate was for the quarter ended december   as compared to for the quarter ended september   and for the quarter ended december  customer retention for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the customer retention rate for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to the expiration of the  square foot autotrader 
com lease at peachtree dunwoody pavilion in atlanta  the expiration of the  square foot alta mesa lease at enclave in houston  and the early termination of the  square foot health care services corporation lease at east wacker drive in chicago

ebitda  as calculated by us  is not comparable to ebitda reported by other reits that do not define ebitda exactly as we do 
page of the company believes that ebitda helps investors and parkway s management analyze the company s ability to service debt and pay cash distributions 
however  the material limitations associated with using ebitda as a non gaap financial measure compared to cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities are that ebitda does not reflect the company s historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures or the cash required to make interest and principal payments on the company s outstanding debt 
although ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  the company compensates for the limitations by only using ebitda to supplement gaap financial measures 
additionally  the company believes that investors should consider ebitda in conjunction with net income and the other required gaap measures of its performance and liquidity to improve their understanding of parkway s operating results and liquidity

parkway s share of the mortgage loan is million 
in  the company has million in secured debt maturities 
of this amount million relates to debt secured by the renaissance center  a  square foot office property  located in memphis  tennessee  which was sold on march   with the buyer assuming the debt upon sale 
the remaining million debt maturity will be repaid using amounts available under the company s senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
the company presently has plans to make recurring capital expenditures to its office properties in of approximately to million on a consolidated basis  with approximately to million representing parkway s proportionate share of recurring capital improvements 
these costs include tenant improvements  leasing costs and recurring building improvements 
additionally  the company plans to make improvements related to upgrades on properties acquired in recent years that were anticipated at the time of purchase in of approximately to million with approximately to million representing parkway s proportionate share 
all such improvements are expected to be financed by cash flow from the properties  capital expenditure escrow accounts  advances from the company s senior unsecured revolving credit facility and contributions from joint venture partners 
the company anticipates that its current cash balance  operating cash flows  contributions from joint venture partners and borrowings including borrowing availability under the company s senior unsecured revolving credit facility will be adequate to pay the company s i operating and administrative expenses  ii debt service and debt maturity obligations  iii distributions to stockholders  iv capital improvements  and v normal repair and maintenance expenses at its properties  both in the short and long term 
in addition  the company may use proceeds from sales of assets and the possible sale of equity securities to fund these items

long term debt also includes principal and interest payments due under the company s credit facilities which expire on january  the amounts presented for purchase obligations represent the remaining tenant improvement allowances and lease inducement costs for leases in place and commitments for building improvements at december  critical accounting estimates general 
parkway s investments are generally made in office properties 
therefore  the company is generally subject to risks incidental to the ownership of real estate 
some of these risks include changes in supply or demand for office properties or customers for such properties in an area in which we have buildings  changes in real estate tax rates  and changes in federal income tax  real estate and zoning laws 
the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of parkway properties  inc  its majority owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which the company has a controlling interest 
parkway also consolidates subsidiaries where the entity is a variable interest entity and parkway is the primary beneficiary 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of the company s significant accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies due to the increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
parkway considers critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following revenue recognition  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate  initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
the cumulative difference between lease revenue recognized under this method and contractual lease payment terms is recorded as straight line rent receivable on the accompanying balance sheets 
page of when the company is the owner of the tenant improvements  the leased space is ready for its intended use when the tenant improvements are substantially completed 
in limited instances  when the customer is the owner of the tenant improvements  straight line rent is recognized when the tenant takes possession of the unimproved space 
the leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursement of a portion of common area maintenance and other operating expenses 
property operating cost recoveries from customers expense reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period in which the expenses are incurred 
the computation of expense reimbursements is dependent on the provisions of individual customer leases 
most customers make monthly fixed payments of estimated expense reimbursements 
the company makes adjustments  positive or negative  to expense reimbursement income quarterly to adjust the recorded amounts to the company s best estimate of the final property operating costs based on the most recent quarterly budget 
after the end of the calendar year  the company computes each customer s final expense reimbursements and issues a bill or credit for the difference between the actual amount and the amounts billed monthly during the year 
management company income represents market based fees earned from providing management  construction  leasing  brokerage and acquisition services to third parties 
management fee income is computed and recorded monthly in accordance with the terms set forth in the standalone management service agreements 
leasing and brokerage commissions are recognized pursuant to the terms of the standalone agreements at the time underlying leases are signed  which is the point at which the earnings process is complete and collection of the fees is reasonably assured 
fees relating to the purchase or sale of property are recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection of the fees is reasonably assured  which usually occurs at closing 
all fees on company owned properties and consolidated joint ventures are eliminated in consolidation 
the portion of fees earned on unconsolidated joint ventures attributable to parkway s ownership interest is eliminated in consolidation 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in the supply or demand of customers for our properties could impact our ability to fill available space 
should a significant amount of available space exist for an extended period  our investment in a particular office building may be impaired 
we evaluate our real estate assets upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the carrying amount 
we classify certain assets as held for sale based on management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions to close in the next twelve months 
we consider an office property as held for sale once we have executed a contract for sale  allowed the buyer to complete its due diligence review and received a substantial non refundable deposit 
until a buyer has completed its due diligence review of the asset  necessary approvals have been received and substantive conditions to the buyer s obligation to perform have been satisfied  we do not consider a sale to be probable 
when the company identifies an asset as held for sale  we estimate the net realizable value of such asset and discontinue recording depreciation on the asset 
the company records assets held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered 
a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
the cash flow and fair value estimates are based on assumptions about employing the asset for its remaining useful life 
factors considered in projecting future cash flows include but are not limited to existing leases  future leasing and terminations  market rental rates  capital improvements  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  inflation and other known variables 
upon impairment  the company would recognize an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to our estimate of its fair value 
the estimate of fair value and cash flows to be generated from properties requires us to make assumptions 
if one or more assumptions prove incorrect or if the assumptions change  the recognition of an impairment loss on one or more properties may be necessary in the future  which would result in a decrease to net income 
impairment loss on real estate 
during  management began a review of the company s strategy and in connection with this strategic review evaluated its operating properties in an attempt to determine the most effective way to maximize the value of its holdings over time 
the company defines non strategic assets as office and parking properties that management believes i are located in markets where the company cannot achieve adequate critical mass or that do not exhibit attractive long term growth characteristics  ii do not have compelling rent growth or cash flow potential  or iii additional capital investment would not produce acceptable returns 
as a result of this review  the company accelerated the sale of certain non strategic assets and recorded total impairment losses on real estate from continuing operations of million and discontinued operations of million for year ended december  parkway s proportionate share of total impairment losses on real estate from continuing operations was million and discontinued operations of million  for a total of million for the year ended december  impairment losses on real estate in continuing operations are comprised of a million loss in connection with two assets located in jackson  mississippi and memphis  tennessee  and a  loss on non depreciable land in new orleans  louisiana 
impairment losses on real estate in discontinued operations are comprised of the million loss parkway s share million in connection with the sale of parkway s interests in the fund i office portfolio  a million loss in connection with a parcel of land in jackson  mississippi and the sale of assets in jackson  mississippi  memphis  tennessee  and richmond  virginia  a million loss in connection with the proposed sale of east wacker in chicago  illinois  a million loss in connection with the wells fargo building office property in houston  texas  and a million loss in connection with the sale of tower at gervais in columbia  south carolina 
the company may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
changes that could cause these impairment losses include a decision by the company to sell the asset rather than hold for long term investment purposes  or changes in management s estimates of future cash flows from the assets that cause the future undiscounted cash flows to be less than the asset s carrying amount 
given the uncertainties with the economic environment  management cannot predict whether or not the company will incur impairment losses in the future  and if impairment losses are recorded  management cannot predict the magnitude of such losses 
page of depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate 
depreciation of buildings and parking garages is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
depreciation of building improvements is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
if our estimate of useful lives proves to be incorrect  the depreciation expense recognized would also be incorrect 
therefore  a change in the estimated useful lives assigned to buildings and improvements would result in either an increase or decrease in depreciation expense  which would result in a decrease or increase in earnings 
initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired 
parkway accounts for its acquisitions of real estate by allocating the fair value of real estate to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building  garage  building improvements and tenant improvements  identified intangible assets and liabilities  which consist of the value of above and below market losses  lease costs  the value of in place leases  customer relationships and any value attributable to above or below market debt assumed with the acquisition 
parkway allocates the purchase price of properties to tangible and intangible assets based on fair values 
the company determines the fair value of the tangible and intangible components using a variety of methods and assumptions all of which result in an approximation of fair value 
differing assumptions and methods could result in different estimates of fair value and thus  a different purchase price allocation and corresponding increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating expense recoveries due from customers 
change in the supply of or demand for office properties could impact our customers ability to honor their lease obligations  which could in turn affect our recorded revenues and estimates of the collectability of our receivables 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized and accrued as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as credit quality of our customers  delinquency of payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for customer balances that are over days past due and for specific customer receivables for which collection is considered doubtful 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which change the wording used to describe the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value  changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the fasb does not intend for asu to result in a change in the application of the requirements in asc the requirements of asu will be effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of asu on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income  which modifies reporting requirements for comprehensive income in order to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
asu requires presentation of either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements in which the first statement presents net income and its components followed by a second statement that presents total other comprehensive income  the components of other comprehensive income  and total comprehensive income 
the requirements of asu will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of asu on the company s consolidated financial statements 
page of in september  the fasb issued asu  which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors in determining when a two step quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary 
if an entity determines  based on qualitative factors  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the entity would then be required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit 
the requirements of asu will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   but early adoption is permitted 
at december   the company had implemented asu funds from operations ffo management believes that ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits and computes this measure in accordance with the nareit definition of ffo including any guidance that nareit releases with respect to the definition 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with gaap  reduced by preferred dividends  excluding gains or losses on depreciable real estate and extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments to derive the company s pro rata share of ffo of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures 
further  the company does not adjust ffo to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges 
on october   nareit issued updated guidance on reporting ffo such that impairment losses on depreciable real estate should be excluded from the computation of ffo for current and prior periods 
the company believes that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses 
however  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization  among other items  from net income  as defined by gaap 
the company believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required gaap presentations  has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful 
ffo as reported by parkway may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition 
funds from operations do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the company s net loss to ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december net loss for parkway properties  inc adjustments to derive funds from operations depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization discontinued operations noncontrolling interest depreciation and amortization noncontrolling interest unit holders adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures preferred dividends gain on sale of real estate impairment loss on depreciable real estate funds from operations attributable to common stockholders page of funds from operations attributable to common stockholders for the years ended december  and include the company s proportionate share of the following items in thousands year ended december gain on involuntary conversion gain loss on extinguishment of debt acquisition costs expenses related to litigation lease termination fee income change in fair value of contingent consideration non cash charge for interest rate swap realignment expenses personnel loss on non depreciable assets mortgage loan receivable loss on non depreciable assets land inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
additionally  most of the leases require the customers to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company s leases typically have three to seven year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at market base rent  which may be higher or lower than the existing lease rate
