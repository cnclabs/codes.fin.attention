item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
overview general our primary business is to provide bankcard payment processing services to merchants in the united states and canada 
this involves facilitating the exchange of information and funds between merchants and cardholders financial institutions  providing end to end electronic payment processing services to merchants  including merchant set up and training  transaction authorization and electronic draft capture  clearing and settlement  merchant accounting  merchant assistance and support  and risk management 
our merchant customers primarily fall into two categories our core small and mid sized merchants referred to as small and midsized enterprises  or sme merchants and network services large national and mid tier merchants  primarily in the petroleum industry referred to as network services merchants 
we also provide additional services to our merchants  such as payroll processing  gift and loyalty programs  paper check processing  and we sell and rent point of sale devices and supplies 
at december   we provided our bankcard payment processing services to approximately  active sme bankcard merchants located across the united states 
this represents a slight decrease over the  active sme bankcard merchants at december  at december   we provided bankcard payment processing services to approximately network services merchants with approximately  locations 
additionally  at december   we provided bankcard payment processing services to approximately  merchants in canada through our owned subsidiary collective pos solutions ltd 
cpos 
our total bankcard processing volume for the years ended december  was billion  an increase from the billion processed during the year ended december  our sme bankcard processing volume for the year ended december  was billion  a increase over billion in  and included increases for american express and discover card processing  which were initiated in our discover processing volume also continued to benefit from our purchase of an existing merchant portfolio from discover during the third quarter of we include american express volume in our sme bankcard processing volume only where we receive percentage based residual compensation for that volume 
our bankcard processing volume for also includes billion of settled volume for network services merchants  compared to billion for bankcard processing volume for the years ended december   and was as follows 
table of contents year ended december  in millions sme merchants network services merchants canada total bankcard processing volume a a bankcard processing volume includes volume for credit and signature debit transactions 
merchant attrition is expected in the card payment processing industry in the ordinary course of business 
we experience attrition in merchant bankcard processing volume resulting from several factors  including business closures  transfers of merchants accounts to our competitors and account closures that we initiate due to heightened credit risks relating to  or contract breaches by  merchants  and when applicable same store sales contraction 
we measure sme processing volume attrition against all sme merchants that were processing with us in the same month a year earlier 
during the year ended december   we experienced an improved average annualized attrition in our sme bankcard processing volume compared to an average attrition of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
historically  much of our attrition is related to business closures  which accelerated in and due to weak economic conditions  and in and our volume attrition was also significantly impacted by overall contraction in same store sales 
in our sme business  we measure same store sales growth  or contraction  as the change in bankcard processing volume for all bankcard merchants that were processing with us in the same month a year earlier 
in  same store sales grew on average  compared to a growth and a contraction in and  respectively 
same store sales growth or contraction results from the combination of the increasing or decreasing use by consumers of bankcards for the purchase of goods and services at the point of sale  and sales growth or contraction experienced by our retained sme bankcard merchants 
the following table compares our same store sales growth or contraction during   and same store sales growth contraction first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year our same store sales experience has tracked overall economic conditions  contracting from the second quarter of through the first quarter of as a result of the declining economic conditions during the recession  followed by growth beginning in the second quarter of as the general economy slowly improved 
management believes that the challenging economic conditions may continue to result in modest near term improvements in our existing sme merchants businesses 
we measure the overall production of our sales force by new gross margin installed  which reflects the expected annual gross profit from a merchant contract after deducting processing and servicing costs associated with that revenue 
our newly installed gross margin for the year ended december  increased from the gross margin we installed during the year ended december   this represents the first new margin installed growth since we attribute this increase in newly installed gross margin to the improved economy and refocusing our sales organization on improving individual salespersons productivity 
historically  we compensated our sales managers based on their success in growing the sales force and increasing the total sme merchant base in their regions 
prior to the economic downturn  increases in our direct sales force  including our relationship managers  had led to significant growth in the total sme merchants for which we process and the gross margin generated by those merchants 
however  during the third quarter of we refocused our sales organization toward improving individual sales persons productivity  and so we reduced our relationship manager count  but at the same time more fully engaged our territory managers in the sales process by requiring them to achieve individual minimum monthly gross margin install targets 
combining our relationship managers and territory managers gives us a count of at december   compared to at december  and  at december  we expect to drive improvement in year over year installed margin growth rates in future years principally by increasing our relationship manager and territory manager count 

table of contents the bankcard revenue we earn in our sme business is recurring in nature  as we typically enter into three year service contracts with our card processing sme merchants that  in order to qualify for the agreed upon pricing  require the merchant to achieve bankcard processing volume minimums 
most of our sme revenue is from payment processing fees  which are a combination of a fee equal to a percentage of the dollar amount of each transaction we process plus a flat fee per transaction 
we make mandatory payments of interchange fees to card issuing banks through the card networks and dues  assessments and other network fees to visa  mastercard and discover 
our sme gross bankcard processing revenue is largely driven by visa and mastercard volume processed by our merchants 
more recently  we have increased card processing revenues by processing transactions for sme merchants new to accepting american express and from processing discover transactions 
in contrast to sme card processing revenues  revenues from our network services merchants are largely driven by the number of transactions we process whether settled  or only authorized  not our processing volume  as the merchants which comprise network services customer base pay on a per transaction basis for processing services 
additionally  we provide authorization  settlement and account servicing services on our front and back end systems for american express transactions for larger merchants  and merchants signed to american express by other processors  for those services we receive compensation from american express on a per transaction basis 
the number of transactions we processed for network services merchants and american express for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands network services merchants settled authorized total network services american express sme total we have developed a number of proprietary payment processing systems to increase our operating efficiencies and distribute our processing and merchant data to our three main constituencies our merchant base  our sales force and our customer service staff 
we provide authorization and data capture services to our sme merchants through our internally developed front end processing system  hps exchange 
this system incorporates real time reporting tools through interactive point of sale database maintenance via the internet 
these tools enable merchants  and our employees  to change the messages on credit card receipts and to view sale and return transactions entered into the point of sale device with a few second delay on any computer linked to the internet 
during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our sme transactions were processed through hps exchange 
we provide clearing  settlement and merchant accounting services through our own internally developed back end processing system  passport 
passport enables us to customize these services to the needs of our relationship managers and merchants 
at both december  and  approximately of total sme bankcard merchants were processing on passport 
in the fourth quarter of  the clearing  settlement and merchant accounting services for network services settled transactions were converted onto passport  so that at december   our internal systems are providing all aspects of our network services merchants processing needs 
we also provide payroll processing services throughout the united states 
at december   we processed payroll for  customers  an increase of from  payroll customers at december  our nationwide direct sales force sells our payroll processing services solely on a commission basis 
in  and  we installed   and  new payroll processing customers  respectively 
we developed a new comprehensive payroll management system  which we refer to as plusone payroll  that streamlines all aspects of the payroll process to enable time and cost savings 
plusone payroll was made available to new and existing customers beginning in we fully converted all of our existing payroll customers to plusone payroll in the plusone payroll platform enables us to process payroll on a large scale and provide customizable solutions for businesses of all sizes 
processing system intrusion on january   we publicly announced the discovery of a criminal breach of our payment systems environment the processing system intrusion 
the processing system intrusion involved malicious software that appears to have been 
table of contents used to collect in transit  unencrypted payment card data while it was being processed by us during the transaction authorization process 
we believe the breach has been contained and did not extend beyond see legal and regulatory considerations for further detail and related events 
since our announcement of the processing system intrusion on january  and through december   we have expensed a total of million  before reducing those charges by million of total insurance recoveries 
the majority of the total charges  or approximately million  related to settlements of claims 
approximately million of the total charges were for legal fees and costs we incurred for investigations  defending various claims and actions  remedial actions and crisis management services 
the following table summarizes our provision for processing system intrusion  which we recorded for settlement accruals  legal fees and costs we incurred for defending various claims and actions associated with the processing system intrusion  and amounts we recovered from our insurance providers for the years ended december   and year ended december  in millions  except per share data charges for settlement accruals  legal fees and costs insurance recoveries provision for recovery of processing system intrusion costs per share in and  we had entered into settlements with the bankcard networks for various claims and disputes related to the processing system intrusion 
during the year ended december   we settled the following claims and disputes related to the processing system intrusion on january   we entered into a settlement agreement with heartland bank  keybank national association keybank  and  together with heartland bank  the sponsor banks  and visa usa inc  visa international service association and visa inc collectively  visa to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us  the sponsor banks and visa with respect to the potential rights and claims of visa and certain issuers of visa branded credit and debit cards related to the processing system intrusion the visa settlement agreement 
after including a  credit for fines previously collected by visa during  the amount we paid under the visa settlement agreement was million 
the costs of this settlement were included in our provision for processing system intrusion on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and in our reserve for processing system intrusion on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  financial institutions representing more than percent of eligible visa branded credit and debit cards have accepted the offers they received pursuant to the settlement entered into between and among us  visa  and our sponsoring acquirers 
on february   we entered into a bridge loan agreement the bridge loan agreement with keybank  as administrative agent  and keybank and heartland bank as bridge lenders 
on that date  keybank made a bridge loan to us in the amount of million and heartland bank made a bridge loan in the amount of million collectively  the bridge loan 
see note  credit facilities for additional terms of the bridge loan 
on february   we also entered into a commitment increase agreement pursuant to the amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may  the commitment increase agreement whereby keybank  as one of the lenders under the amended and restated credit agreement  agreed to increase our revolving credit commitment to us under the amended and restated credit agreement by million the increased credit commitment 
see note  credit facilities for additional terms of the commitment increase agreement 
the proceeds of the bridge loan and the increased credit commitment  together with a portion of our cash reserves  were used to fund the settlement with visa 
the visa settlement agreement was consummated on february   with a payment of million 
on may   we entered into a settlement agreement with mastercard worldwide mastercard to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us  the sponsor banks and mastercard related to the processing system intrusion the mastercard settlement agreement 
under the mastercard settlement agreement  alternative recovery offers totaling million were made to eligible mastercard issuers with respect to losses alleged to have been incurred by them as a result of the processing system intrusion 
the million included a million credit 
table of contents for fines previously collected by mastercard during  so the maximum amount payable under the settlement was million if all mastercard issuers had accepted the settlement 
on september  and september   we paid approximately million because certain issuers did not accept settlement 
those issuers  who represent less than of the accounts eligible for the settlement  have been preliminarily awarded  by mastercard  and we are contesting that award 
on august   we entered into an agreement of settlement and release with dfs services  llc discover to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us and discover and its affiliates and certain of its issuers with respect to the processing system intrusion the discover settlement agreement 
on september   we paid discover million in full and final satisfaction of any and all claims of discover  its affiliates and certain of its issuers arising from or relating to the processing system intrusion 
the discover settlement agreement contains mutual releases by and between us and discover on behalf of itself and its affiliates relating to the processing system intrusion 
during the year ended december   we settled the following claims and disputes related to the processing system intrusion on december   we entered into a settlement agreement and release with american express to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us and american express and its issuers with respect to the processing system intrusion  and subsequently we paid approximately million in full and final satisfaction of any and all claims of american express and its issuers arising from or relating to the processing system intrusion 
such settlement agreement and release contains mutual releases by and between us and american express on behalf of itself and its issuers relating to the processing system intrusion 
these settlement amounts were previously provided for in our provision for processing system intrusion and carried in our reserve for processing system intrusion 
we do not consider it a reasonable possibility that losses exceeding the amounts already recognized on the matters subject to the settlement agreements will be incurred 
with regard to the unsettled claims related to the processing system intrusion  which we describe in item legal proceedings  we determined material losses in addition to those previously accrued are not considered reasonably possible on any such claim disclosed 
we are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves against any unsettled claims relating to the processing system intrusion that have been asserted against us and our sponsor banks to date 
we feel we have strong defenses to all the claims that have been asserted against us and our sponsor banks relating to the processing system intrusion 
additional costs we expect to incur for legal fees and costs for defending the unsettled claims and actions associated with the processing system intrusion will be recognized as incurred 
such costs are not expected to be material to our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
financial highlights our financial results for the year ended december  benefited from an improved operating margin  reflecting year over year growth in net revenues and a decrease in processing and servicing costs compared to december  for  we recorded net income of million  or per share compared to a net income of million  or per share  in during the year ended december   we expensed million  or per share for accruals  legal fees and costs we incurred for defending various claims and actions associated with the processing system intrusion 
during the year ended december   we recovered from our insurance providers million of the costs previously incurred for the processing system intrusion and expensed million for legal fees and costs incurred for defending various claims and actions  resulting in net recovery of million  or about per share for the year 
see processing system intrusion for more detail 
the following is a summary of our financial results for the year ended december  net revenue  which we define as total revenues less interchange fees and dues  assessments and fees  increased to million during from million during the increase in net revenue was driven by the increase in sme merchant processing revenues and increases in card processing revenues at cpos  loyalty and gift processing revenues  recently acquired k to school solutions processing revenues  payroll processing revenues and equipment related revenues 
our sme bankcard processing volume increased to billion  compared to billion in this increase in sme bankcard processing volume was primarily attributable to same store sales growth and reduced merchant attrition in  and growth in american express and discover processing volume 
processing and servicing expense for decreased by million or  compared with the decrease in processing and servicing expense for the year ended december  was primarily due to reductions in transaction processing costs on network services front end transactions  lower sme residual commission expense  reduced 
table of contents merchant losses and reduced costs of support personnel  particularly account managers 
lower residual commissions were the result of exercising our right to buy out a substantial amount of portfolio equity owned by our relationship managers and sales managers during the third quarter of we continue to buy out portfolio equity 
partially offsetting these reductions were increased costs associated with servicing higher bankcard processing volume and increased costs of sales and servicing related to the higher payroll  loyalty and gift marketing  and equipment related revenues as well as cost of sales and service for the k to school solutions businesses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase reflects costs we incurred in consolidating our data centers  expenses related to acquisitions  restoration of incentive compensation and increased staff in our income from operations  which we also refer to as operating income  increased to million for from million in primarily due to the growth of our net revenues and the decrease in processing and servicing expense 
our operating margin  which is measured as operating income divided by net revenue  was for  compared to for see results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for a more detailed discussion of our full year operating results 
components of revenues and expenses revenues 
our revenues fall into three categories gross processing revenue  payroll processing revenue and equipment related income 
our gross processing revenue primarily consists of discount  per transaction and periodic primarily monthly fees from the processing of visa  mastercard  american express and discover transactions for our sme merchants and per transaction fees for the authorization and settlement of transactions by network services 
gross processing revenue also includes american express and discover servicing fees  customer service fees  fees for processing chargebacks  termination fees on terminated contracts  k to school solutions fees  gift and loyalty card fees and other miscellaneous revenue 
revenues are recorded at the time service is provided 
payroll processing revenue includes fees charged by our subsidiary  heartland payroll company  for payroll processing services  including check printing  direct deposit  related federal  state and local tax deposits and providing accounting documentation and interest income earned on funds held for customers 
revenues are recorded at the time service is provided 
equipment related income includes revenues from the sale  rental and deployment of bankcard and check processing terminals 
our equipment related income also includes revenues from the sale of hardware  software and associated services for prepaid card and stored value card payment systems and from the sale of hardware  software and associated services for campus and k to payment solutions 
equipment revenues are recorded at the time of shipment  or the provision of service 
most of these revenue items tend to grow with our overall merchant growth 
expenses 
our most significant expense is interchange fees  which are set by the card networks  and are paid to the card issuing banks 
for our sme bankcard processing  we do not offset bankcard processing revenues and interchange fees because our business practice is to advance the interchange fees to most of our merchants when settling their daily transactions thus paying the full amount of the transaction to the merchant  and then to collect our full discount fees from our merchants on the first business day of the next month 
as network services does not advance interchange fees to its merchants  we record its portion of our processing revenues net of interchange fees 
interchange fees are calculated as a percentage of the dollar volume processed plus a per transaction fee 
we also pay visa  mastercard and discover network dues  assessments and fees  which are a combination of a percentage of the dollar volume processed and per transaction fees 
interchange fees and dues  assessments and fees are recognized at the time transactions are processed 
it is our policy to pass along to our merchants any changes in interchange fees and card network dues  assessments and fees 
since the card networks regularly adjust those rates  our gross processing revenue will increase or decrease  but all the impact of such changes will be paid to the card issuing banks and our income from operations will not be affected 
costs of services also include processing and servicing costs  customer acquisition costs  and depreciation and amortization 
processing and servicing costs include processing costs  which are either paid to third parties  including our bank sponsors  or represent the cost of our own authorization capture and accounting settlement systems 
during  third party costs represented about of our processing costs 
during  third party costs represented about of our processing costs  compared to during approximately and  respectively  of our third party processing costs in and were 
table of contents paid to fujitsu for processing network services transactions 
approximately  and  respectively  of our third party processing costs in  and were paid to tsys acquiring solutions  residual commission payments to our relationship managers  sales managers  trade associations  agent banks and value added resellers  which are a percentage of the gross margin we generated from our merchant contracts during the accounting period  the costs of operating our service centers  including telecommunications costs  personnel costs  occupancy costs  losses due to merchant defaults  depreciation and amortization  and other direct merchant servicing costs  and the costs of bankcard terminals  prepaid card and stored value hardware deployed  and merchant supplies 
customer acquisition costs reflect the amortization over the initial three year contract term of the cash signing bonus paid and the deferred acquisition costs for vested relationship managers and sales managers  as well as changes in the accrued buyout liability  which reflect the impact of buying out residual commissions see critical accounting estimates accrued buyout liability and volume attrition 
depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we have made significant capital expenditures for computer hardware and software and such costs are generally depreciated over three to five years 
general and administrative expenses include personnel and other administrative expenses related to our information technology infrastructure costs  our marketing expenses and other administrative functions 
other income expense consists of interest income on cash and investments  the interest cost on our borrowings  gain from the sale of merchant bankcard processing contracts  legal settlements accrued or received  exit costs  and other non operating income or expense items 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the critical accounting estimates described here are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations  including those whose application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the line items on our income statement and balance sheet impacted by management s estimates are described below 
revenues our bank card processing revenue is derived from processing and settling visa  mastercard  american express and discover bank card transactions for our merchant customers 
our most significant expense related to the generation of those revenues is interchange fees  which are set by the card networks  and paid to the card issuing banks 
for our sme merchant bank card processing  we do not offset bank card processing revenues and interchange fees because our business practice is to advance the interchange fees to most of our merchants when settling their daily transactions thus paying the full amount of the transaction to the merchant  and then to collect our full discount fees from our merchants on the first business day of the next month 
we believe this policy aids in new business generation  as our merchants benefit from bookkeeping simplicity 
however  this results in our carrying a large receivable from our merchants at each period end  and a corresponding but smaller payable to our sponsor banks  which are settled on the first business day after the period end 
as we are at risk for the receivables  we record the associated revenues on a gross processing revenue basis in our consolidated income statements 
certain of our competitors report their processing revenue net of interchange fees 
this is because the card issuing banks make their payments to these competitors net of those interchange fees  and these acquirers pay this reduced amount to their merchants 
since the acquisition of network services  we also record a portion of our processing revenues net of interchange fees because the daily cash settlement with network services merchants is net of interchange fees 
capitalized customer acquisition costs capitalized customer acquisition costs consist of up front signing bonuses paid to relationship managers and sales managers  referred to as the salesperson or salespersons  for the establishment of new merchant relationships  and deferred acquisition cost representing the estimated cost of buying out the commissions of vested salespersons at some point in the future 
capitalized customer acquisition costs represent incremental  direct customer acquisition costs that are recoverable 
table of contents through gross margins associated with sme merchant contracts 
the capitalized customer acquisition costs are amortized using a method which approximates a proportional revenue approach over the initial three year term of the merchant contract 
the amount of the up front signing bonus paid for new sme bankcard  payroll and check processing accounts is based on the estimated gross margin for the first year of the merchant contract 
the gross signing bonuses paid during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the signing bonus paid  amount capitalized  and related amortization are adjusted at the end of the first year to reflect the actual gross margin generated by the merchant contract during that year 
the net signing bonus adjustments made during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
negative signing bonus adjustments occur when the actual gross margin generated by the merchant contract during the first year is less than the estimated gross margin for that year  resulting in the overpayment of the up front signing bonus and would be recovered from the relevant sales person 
positive signing bonus adjustments result from prior underpayments of up front signing bonuses  and would be paid to the relevant salesperson 
the amount of signing bonuses paid which remained subject to adjustment at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the deferred acquisition cost component is accrued for vested salespersons over the first year of sme bankcard merchant processing  consistent with the build up in the accrued buyout liability  which is described below 
management evaluates the capitalized customer acquisition costs for impairment at each balance sheet date by comparing  on a pooled basis by vintage month of origination  the expected future net cash flows from underlying merchant relationships to the carrying amount of the capitalized customer acquisition costs 
if the estimated future net cash flows are lower than the recorded carrying amount  indicating an impairment of the value of the capitalized customer acquisition costs  the impairment loss will be charged to operations 
at december   we recognized an impairment charge related to the decision to discontinue express funds  our remote deposit check capture product 
we have not recognized an impairment loss in or accrued buyout liability we pay our salespersons residual commissions based on the gross margin generated from the monthly processing activity of sme merchants signed by them 
we refer to these residual commissions as the owned portion of such commissions  or portfolio equity 
the salesperson has no obligation to perform additional services for the merchant for so long as the merchant continues processing with us 
we accrue the buyout liability  which represents the estimated current settlement cost of buying out all vested and expected to vest salespersons for the owned portion of such commissions 
we also record a deferred acquisition cost asset related to those buyouts  and amortize that asset as an expense over the initial year contract term 
we consider a salesperson to be vested once they have established merchant relationships that generate the equivalent of  of monthly gross margin 
vested status entitles the salesperson to his or her residual commissions for as long as the merchant processes with us  even if the salesperson is no longer employed by us 
the accrued buyout liability is based on the sme merchants we have under contract at the balance sheet date  the gross margin we generated from those accounts in the prior twelve months  the owned commission rate  and the fixed buyout multiple of times the commissions 
the liability related to a new merchant is therefore zero when the merchant is installed  and increases over the twelve months following the installation date 
for unvested salespersons  the accrued buyout liability is accrued over the expected vesting period  however  no deferred acquisition cost is capitalized as future services are required in order to vest 
in calculating the accrued buyout liability for unvested salespersons  we have assumed that of unvested salespersons will vest in the future  which represents our historical vesting rate 
a increase to in the expected vesting rate would have increased the accrued buyout liability for unvested salespersons by million and million respectively  at december  and buyout payments made to salespersons reduce the outstanding accrued buyout liability 
given our view of the duration of the cash flows associated with a pool of merchant contracts  we believe that the benefits of such buyouts significantly exceed the cost  which typically represents years of commissions 
if the cash flows associated with a pool of bought out contracts does not exceed this cost  we will incur an economic loss on our decision to buyout the contracts 
during   and  we made buyout payments of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we exercised our rights to buy out a substantial amount of portfolio equity owned by our relationship managers and sales managers 
as a result of these buyouts  we reduced our accrued buyout liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet by the approximately million of cash payments we made 
the amount of 
table of contents future annual reductions in residual commission expense will be impacted by merchant attrition 
we expect to make significant buyout payments in the future  subject to available cash  as such buyouts reduce the monthly payments we will have to make to our salespersons for such merchants in the future 
processing liabilities and loss reserves the majority of our processing liabilities include funds in transit associated with bankcard and check processing 
at december  and  these funds in transit totaled million and million  respectively 
in addition  we maintain merchant deposits to offset potential liabilities from merchant chargeback processing 
disputes between a cardholder and a merchant periodically arise as a result of  among other things  the cardholder s dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services 
such disputes may not be resolved in the merchant s favor 
in these cases  the transaction is charged back to the merchant  which means the purchase price is refunded to the customer by the card issuing bank and charged to the merchant 
if the merchant is unable to fund the refund  we must do so 
we also bear the risk of reject losses arising from the fact that we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period 
if the merchant has gone out of business during such period  we may be unable to collect such fees 
we maintain cash deposits or require the pledge of a letter of credit from certain merchants  generally those with higher average transaction size where the card is not present when the charge is made or the product or service is delivered after the charge is made  in order to offset potential contingent liabilities such as chargebacks and reject losses that would arise if the merchant went out of business 
at december  and  we held sme merchant deposits totaling million and million  respectively 
most chargeback and reject losses are charged to processing and servicing as they are incurred 
however  we also maintain a loss reserve against losses including major fraud losses  which are both less predictable and involve larger amounts 
the loss reserve was established using historical loss rates  applied to recent bankcard processing volume 
at december  and  our loss reserve totaled million and million  respectively 
aggregate sme bankcard merchant losses  including losses charged to operations and the loss reserve  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and during the fourth quarter of  we converted network services settled transactions from a third party processor and began settling network services merchant accounts  and processing chargebacks originating from these merchants  on passport 
prior to this  these chargebacks were processed and carried by vantiv  inc  which was our third party outsourced processor for settling network services merchant accounts 
chargeback losses originating from network services bankcard processing on passport during the year ended december  was approximately  stock based compensation we expense employee share based payments under the fair value method 
share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
under the modified prospective transition method  we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption using grant date fair value estimate and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards using the grant date fair value estimate 
we estimate the grant date fair value of the stock options we issue using a black scholes valuation model for plain vanilla stock options and performance based stock options  and we use a lattice valuation model to measure grant date fair value for stock options containing market vesting conditions 
our assumption for expected volatility is based on our historical volatility data related to market trading of our own common stock 
we base our assumptions for the expected life of new stock option grants on our analysis of the historical exercise patterns of our stock options 
previously  we estimated the expected life of a stock option based on the simplified method for plain vanilla stock options as provided by the staff of the sec 
our dividend yield assumption is based on dividends expected to be paid over the expected life of the stock option 
our risk free interest rate assumption for stock options granted is determined by using us treasury rates of the same period as the expected option term of each stock option 
the weighted average fair value of options we granted during  and were  and  respectively 
the fair value of options granted during  and was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions 
table of contents year ended december  expected volatility expected life years years to years expected dividends risk free interest rate in the second quarter of  our board of directors approved grants of  stock options subject to multiple vesting conditions 
under these stock options  the employee must provide continuous service over four years and a market price condition must be satisfied within those four years 
these stock options have a five year term and could vest in equal amounts in   and only if during the four year service period  the price of our common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange exceeds two or three times the exercise price for consecutive trading days 
the grant date fair values of these multiple vesting condition options are recognized as compensation expense over their four year service periods 
at december    of the  stock options have vested 
in the third quarter of  our board of directors approved a performance based stock option program 
under this program  we granted million performance based stock options to our employees 
these stock options were granted to those employees who the board of directors determined could have significant impact on successfully integrating the recently acquired network services business and effectively executing our growth plan 
these stock options have a five year term and will vest in equal amounts in  and only if over the term of the stock options  both of the following performance conditions are achieved consolidated net revenue grows at a compound annual rate of at least  and fully diluted eps grows at a compound annual rate of at least 
as of december   and  management believed that achieving these performance conditions was not more likely than not to occur  therefore  no share based compensation expense was recorded for these stock options for these years 
the evaluation of the likelihood of achieving these performance conditions will be repeated quarterly  and if vesting of some or all of the options becomes more likely than not  share based compensation expense will be recorded 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved grants of  performance based restricted share units 
these restricted share units are nonvested share awards which would vest in  in  and in only if over the term of these restricted share units  the following diluted earnings per share targets for the years ended december   and are achieved diluted earnings per share a a calculated on a pro forma basis to exclude non operating gains and losses  if any  and excluding the after tax impact of stock compensation expense 
as of december   management believed that achieving these performance targets was more likely than not to occur and we began recording share based compensation expense for these restricted share units 
the closing price of our common stock on the grant date equals the grant date fair value of these nonvested restricted share units awards and will be recognized as compensation expense over their vesting periods 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved grants of  performance based restricted share units 
these restricted share units are nonvested share awards which would vest in and in only if we achieve a diluted earnings per share compound annual growth rate cagr of seventeen percent for the two year period ending december  diluted earnings per share will be calculated on a pro forma basis to exclude non operating gains and losses  if any  and exclude the after tax impact of stock compensation expense 
for each that the cagr actually achieved for the two year period ending on december  is above the target  the number of shares underlying the restricted share units awarded would be increased by  provided  however  that the maximum increase in the number of shares that may be awarded is 
likewise  for each that the cagr actually achieved for the two year period ending on december  is below the target  the number of shares underlying the restricted share units awarded would be decreased by 
if the target cagr is missed by or more  then the number of shares awarded is zero 
as of december   management believed that achieving the two year cagr target was more likely than not to occur and began recording share based compensation expense for these restricted share units 
the closing price of our 
table of contents common stock on the grant date equals the grant date fair value of these nonvested restricted share units awards and will be recognized as compensation expense over their vesting periods 
amounts we recognized in our financial statements during the years ended december   and with respect to share based compensation plans were as follows in thousands year ended december  compensation expense recognized on share based plans before income tax benefit related income tax benefit recognized in the income statement cash received from stock option exercises excess tax benefit recorded for tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options tax benefit realized as reductions of estimated tax payments during the period goodwill goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair values of net assets acquired in business combinations 
we recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisitions  including our recent and acquisitions of lunchbox  comalex  myschoolbucks and school link 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or changes in circumstances suggest a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator or change in circumstances relating to impairment has occurred 
such changes may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and slower growth rates 
we perform annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
our evaluation indicated that no impairment existed as of december  or at december  and  goodwill of million and million  respectively  was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of or prior to then  if any such indicators constitute a triggering event in other than the quarter in which the annual goodwill impairment test is performed 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment loss would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
income taxes we account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the effects of differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
judgments are required in determining the amount and probability of future taxable income  which in turn is critical to a determination of whether a valuation reserve against the deferred tax asset is appropriate 
we also account for the recognition and measurement of tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 
this requires evaluations of individual tax positions to determine whether any part of that position can be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements 
an uncertain tax position exists if it is unclear how a transaction will be treated under tax law 
we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december   approximately million of which would impact the effective tax rate 
we have recorded income tax expense benefit at us tax rates on all taxable income loss  except undistributed earnings of cpos  our canadian subsidiary 
we intend to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of cpos and accordingly  have provided canadian income tax on those earnings but not us income tax 
the amount of undistributed earnings of cpos for which we have not recorded us income tax was approximately million 
in the event of distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to us income taxes subject to an adjustment  if any  for foreign tax credits 
determination of the amount of us income tax liability that would be incurred is not practicable because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation

the durbin amendment  which was part of the july dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection 
table of contents act and went into effect on october   places limits on debit card interchange rates that card issuing banks may charge 
while not impacting our net revenue which for sme merchants is presented net of interchange  dues and assessments and fees  beginning in the fourth quarter of  there was a decrease in the interchange expense we record in our income statement of approximately million as a result of the durbin amendment 
since our gross card processing revenues include the interchange that we pass through to our sme merchants  our total revenues decreased by an equivalent amount

dues  assessments and fees increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of increases in visa  mastercard and discover assessments which we pass through to our merchants  and also due to higher sme bankcard processing volume and increased due  assessments and fees on our network services merchants

lower residual commissions were the result of exercising our rights to buy out a substantial amount of portfolio equity owned by our relationship managers and sales managers during the third quarter of we continue to buy out portfolio equity 
see critical accounting estimates accrued buyout liability for more detail 
partially offsetting these reductions were increased costs associated with servicing higher bankcard processing volume and increased costs of sales and servicing related to the higher payroll  loyalty and gift marketing  and equipment related revenues as well as cost of sales and service for the k to school solutions businesses 
processing and servicing expense as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in compared with in customer acquisition costs for the year ended december  decreased by million  or compared with the year ended december  this decline primarily reflects the impacts of lower signing bonus amortization  as

the visa settlement agreement required us to obtain a loan of at least million from our sponsor banks  the proceeds of which were to be used to fund the settlement amount 
the settlements with mastercard and discover were funded from our cash reserves 
partially offsetting the impact of these settlements on our operating cash flow was approximately million of cash we recovered from our insurance providers against certain costs we incurred for the processing system intrusion 
other major determinants of operating cash flow in all periods are net signing bonus payments  which consume operating cash as we install new merchants  and payouts on the accrued buyout liability  which represent the costs of buying out residual commissions owned by our salespersons 
see critical accounting estimates capitalized customer acquisition costs and critical accounting estimates accrued buyout liability for more information

the card brand networks generally allow chargebacks up to four months after the later of the date the transaction is processed or the delivery of the product or service to the cardholder 
if the merchant incurring the chargeback is unable to fund the refund to the card issuing bank  we must do so 
as the majority of our sme transactions involve the delivery of the product or service at the time of the transaction  a good basis to estimate our exposure to chargebacks is the last four months bankcard processing volume on our sme portfolio  which was billion for the four months ended december  and billion for the four months ended december  however  during the four months ended december  and december   we were presented with million and million  respectively  of chargebacks by issuing banks

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
we have interest rate risk related to our payable to our sponsor banks 
within our amount payable to our sponsor banks are balances which keybank and heartland bank have advanced to our sme merchants for interchange fees 
we fund these advances first by applying a portion of our available cash and then by incurring a significant payable to our sponsor banks  bearing interest at the prime rate 
at december   our payable to sponsor banks included million for funding interchange advances to our sme merchants 
this payable is repaid in the beginning of the following month out of fees collected from our merchants 
during the quarter ended december  the average daily interest bearing balance of that payable was approximately million 
the outstanding balance of our payable to our sponsor banks is directly related to our bankcard processing volume and also will fluctuate depending on the amount of our available cash 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our average payable to sponsor banks would result in a change of approximately  in annual pre tax income 
we also incur interest rate risk on borrowings under our second amended and restated credit agreement 
the second amended and restated credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of million and a term credit facility of million 
at december   there was million outstanding under the term credit facility and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the term credit facility requires amortization payments in the amount of million for each fiscal quarter during the fiscal years ended december  and  million for each fiscal quarter during the fiscal years ended december  and  and million for each fiscal quarter during the period commencing on january  through the maturity date on november  under the terms of the credit agreement  we may borrow  at our option  at interest rates equal to one  two  three or six month adjusted libor rates  or equal to the greater of the prime rate  the federal funds rate plus and the adjusted libor rate plus  in each case plus a margin determined by our current leverage ratio 
in january  we entered into fixed pay amortizing interest rate swaps having an initial notional amount of million on the variable rate debt outstanding under the term credit facility 
these interest rate swaps convert that initial notional amount to fixed rate 
at december   the remaining notional amount of these interest rate swaps was million 
the impact which a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would have on our outstanding december  balances under the second amended and restated credit agreement would be a decline of approximately  in annual pre tax income  including the effect from interest rate swaps 
while the bulk of our cash and cash equivalents are held in checking accounts or money market funds  we do hold certain fixed income investments with maturities within three years 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an increase of approximately  in annual pre tax income from money market fund holdings  but a decrease in the value of fixed rate investments of approximately  a hypothetical basis point decrease in short term interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately  in annual pre tax income from money market funds  but an increase in the value of fixed rate instruments of approximately

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued an accounting standard update on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to establish the accounting for certain revenue arrangements in which the vendor or service provider will perform multiple revenue generating activities eg  contracts that require an up front fee along with fees that recur over the life of the arrangement 
specifically  the update addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting

in december  the fasb issued an accounting standard update on when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
step requires reporting entities to identify any potential impairments  on either an annual or interim basis  by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and  it is more likely than not that an impairment exists  then the amount of the impairment will be assessed in the updated guidance in step evaluating an impairment in step requires the evaluation of qualitative factors including the factors presented in existing guidance that trigger an interim impairment test of goodwill such as an adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  or the expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or disposed 
this update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  the implementation of this update did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued an accounting standard update which addresses changes to concepts regarding performing fair value measurements including i the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise  ii the valuation of an instrument classified in the reporting entity s shareholder equity  iii the valuation of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio  and iv the application of premiums and discounts 
this update also enhances disclosure requirements about fair value measurements  including providing information regarding level measurements such as quantitative information about unobservable inputs  further discussion of the valuation processes used and assumption sensitivity analysis

in june  the fasb issued an accounting standard update which amends the comprehensive income topic of the current codification 
the update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity  and instead requires consecutive presentation of the statement of net income and other comprehensive income either in a continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the implementation of this update did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standard update on testing goodwill for impairment 
this guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that this is the case  it is required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any 
if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the company has early adopted the update and the implementation of this update did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements
