recent legislative developments as a result of the recent financial crisis that significantly damaged the economy and the financial sector of the united states  the us congress passed  and the president signed  the dodd frank act on july  in addition to making other significant legal and regulatory reforms  dodd frank established a new regulatory body known as the bureau of consumer financial protection the bureau  which will operate as an independent entity within the federal reserve system and is authorized to issue rules for consumer protection  some of which likely will significantly restrain banks flexibility and profitability 
dodd frank also directs the federal banking authorities to issue new capital requirements for banks and holding companies which must be at least as strict as the existing capital requirements for such institutions and may be much more onerous 
of particular importance to bank holding companies like ours  dodd frank provides that any issuances of trust preferred securities on or after may   by bank holding companies with total assets between million and billion will no longer qualify as tier capital 
dodd frank is discussed further below 
there are several other federal laws enacted since the start of the financial crisis that affect financial institutions like us  as well as other recently enacted banking laws that continue to significantly impact our operations 
these various statutes  as well as dodd frank  are discussed briefly below 
the dodd frank act the dodd frank act  enacted in july  includes many provisions affecting the banking and financial services industries  including our company 
among other things  dodd frank gives new powers to the board of governors of the federal reserve system the fed is charged with monitoring the systemic safety of the financial system and directed to take proactive steps to reduce or eliminate threats to the system 
creates a new federal banking agency  the consumer financial protection bureau  with broad powers 
the bureau will write and issue new consumer protection rules 
for depository institutions with billion or less in assets such as arrow s banks  the banks traditional regulatory agencies for our banks  the occ  and not the bureau  will have primary examination and enforcement authority over the banks compliance with new bureau rules as well as all other rules and regulations 
however  the bureau will have the right to include its examiners on a sampling basis in examinations conducted by the traditional regulators and will be authorized to give those agencies input and recommendations with respect to consumer protection laws and to require reports and other examination documents 
the bureau will have broad authority to curb practices it finds to be unfair  deceptive and abusive 
what constitutes abusive behavior may be very broadly defined and is very likely to create an environment conducive to increased litigation 
this is likely to be exacerbated by the fact that  in addition to the federal authorities charged with enforcing the bureau s rules  state attorneys general are also authorized to enforce those federal consumer laws transferred to the bureau and the rules issued by the bureau thereunder 
the activities of the bureau will be monitored by a bureau oversight council  which is charged with the duty of considering the potential benefits and costs for financial institutions and consumers of any bureau proposed regulation and to consider and address any objections from other federal regulators 
however  the oversight council will not have authority to set aside a bureau regulation except in very limited circumstances 
limits current federal preemption standards for national banks such as our banks  that is  the act reduces the extent to which state law is preempted by federal law with regard to the operation of national banks 
specifically  dodd frank increases the potential for state intervention in the operations of national banks and other federally chartered depository institutions by creating new procedural hurdles to preemption determinations while also potentially narrowing the circumstances in which preemption would apply 
moreover  the act provides statutory authority for state law enforcement authorities with respect to federally chartered depository institutions 
makes the  limit for federal deposit insurance permanent by statute  provides unlimited federal deposit insurance until december  for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions  and repeals the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
expands interstate branching authority for national and state banks 
directs federal bank regulators to develop specific capital requirements for holding companies and depository institutions that address activities that pose risk to the financial system  such as significant activities in higher risk areas  or concentrations in assets whose reported values are based on models 
requires the occ to seek to make its capital requirements for national banks countercyclical so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction 
enhances the authority of the fed to examine non bank subsidiaries  such as mortgage affiliates  and also gives other bank regulators the opportunity to examine and take enforcement action against such entities 
establishes a statutory source of strength requirement for both bank and savings and loan holding companies thereby enabling the fed to compel a holding company to contribute additional capital to its subsidiary banks  if the banks are undercapitalized and if the holding company possesses such capital 
expands the coverage of section a of the fra to take account of the credit exposure related to additional transactions  including derivatives transactions  along with other additional restrictions under section a 
requires mortgage originators to act in the best interests of a consumer  and seeks to ensure that a consumer will have the capacity to repay a loan that the consumer enters into 
mandates comprehensive additional residential mortgage loan related disclosures 
requires mortgage loan securitizers to retain a certain amount of risk as established by the regulatory agencies 
however  mortgages that conform to the new regulatory standards as qualified residential mortgages will not be subject to risk retention requirements 
implementation of the act will require dozens of new mandatory and discretionary rulemakings by numerous federal regulatory agencies over the next several years 
as a result  bank holding companies are likely to be faced with thousands of new pages of regulations not to mention increased litigation risk 
while many of the provisions contained in dodd frank are already effective  many have delayed effective dates that have not yet been reached  which  in some cases  may be subject to considerable delay and deferral 
earlier federal laws responding to financial crisis 
federal laws enacted in addressing the financial crisis included the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa and the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra and related governmental programs  such as the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp and the us treasury s capital purchase program cpp  a component of the troubled asset relief program tarp 
in late  the fdic adopted the tlgp to boost consumer confidence in funds deposited with insured institutions 
among other things  the tlgp allowed insured institutions to participate in a program providing additional deposit insurance  specifically  full coverage of noninterest bearing accounts through december  later extended to run through december  at a cost of an additional cents per of additional insured deposits 
we elected to participate in the program in  at a cost to us for the additional deposit insurance of thousand 
we opted out of this program when it was extended in arrow was preliminarily approved by the us treasury department to participate in the cpp program part of tarp 
however  in january  we announced that we would not participate in the cpp due to our strong financial and liquidity positions 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  page in addition  as part of the legislative response to the current financial crisis  various other federal bills have been introduced in the us congress that would significantly affect banks 
we cannot estimate the likelihood of any currently proposed banking bills being enacted into law  or the ultimate effect that any such potential legislation  if enacted  would have upon our financial condition or operations 
health care reform in march  comprehensive federal health care reform legislation was passed under the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the act 
included among the major provisions of the act  is a change in tax treatment of the federal drug subsidy paid with respect to eligible retirees 
the act contains provisions that may impact the company s accounting for some of its benefit plans in future periods by increasing the expense associated with these plans  but at this point  we do not expect that the impact will be material 
the exact extent of the act s impact cannot be determined until final regulations are promulgated and additional interpretations become available 
the company will continue to monitor the effect of the act 
other recently enacted federal laws affecting banks like ours  the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of became effective october  the act addressed many areas of bankruptcy practice  including consumer bankruptcy  general and small business bankruptcy  treatment of tax claims in bankruptcy  ancillary and cross border cases  financial contract protection amendments to chapter governing family farmer reorganization  and special protection for patients of a health care business filing for bankruptcy 
this act did not have a significant impact on our earnings or on our efforts to recover collateral on secured loans 
the sarbanes oxley act  signed into law on july   adopted a number of measures having a significant impact on all publicly traded companies  including arrow 
generally  the act sought to improve the quality of financial reporting of these companies by compelling them to adopt good corporate governance practices and by strengthening the independence of their auditors 
the act placed substantial additional duties on directors  officers  auditors and attorneys of public companies 
among other specific measures  the act required that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify to the sec in the holding company s annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec regarding the accuracy of its financial statements contained therein and the integrity of its internal controls 
the act also accelerated insiders reporting requirements for transactions in company securities  restricted certain executive officer and director transactions  imposed obligations on corporate audit committees  and provided for enhanced review of company filings by the sec 
as part of the general effort to improve public company auditing  the act places limits on consulting services that may be performed by a company s independent auditors by requiring that the company s audit committee of the board of directors evaluate amounts to determine independence 
the act created a federal public company accounting oversight board the pcaob to set auditing standards  inspect registered public accounting firms  and exercise enforcement powers  subject to oversight by the sec 
in the wake of the sarbanes oxley act  the nation s stock exchanges  including the exchange on which arrow s stock is listed  the national association of securities dealers  inc nasd promulgated a wide array of governance standards that must be followed by listed companies 
the nasd standards include having a board of directors the majority of whose members are independent of management  and having audit  compensation and nomination committees of the board consisting exclusively of independent directors 
we have implemented a variety of corporate governance measures and procedures to comply with sarbanes oxley and the amended nasd listing requirements  although we have always relied on a board of directors a majority of whose members are independent and independent board committees to make important decisions regarding the company 
the usa patriot act initially adopted in and re adopted by the us congress in with certain changes the patriot act  imposes substantial record keeping and due diligence obligations on banks and other financial institutions  with a particular focus on detecting and reporting money laundering transactions involving domestic or international customers 
the us treasury department has issued and will continue to issue regulations clarifying the patriot act s requirements 
the patriot act requires all financial institutions  including banks  to maintain certain anti money laundering compliance and due diligence programs 
the provisions of the act impose substantial costs on all financial institutions  including ours 
recent changes in deposit insurance laws and regulations the fdic collects both insurance premiums on insured deposits and an assessment for the financing corporation fico bonds 
fico assessments 
the fico was established by the competitive equality banking act of  as a mixed ownership government corporation whose sole purpose was to issue bonds to insure thrift institutions 
in the subsequent two years  fico issued year noncallable bonds in an aggregate principal amount of approximately billion  maturing in through fico has assessment authority  separate from the fdic s authority to assess risk based premiums for deposit insurance  to collect funds from all fdic insured institutions sufficient to pay interest on fico bonds 
the fdic acts as collection agent for the fico 
since the first quarter of  all fdic insured deposits have been assessed at the same rate by fico 
for  our fico assessment was thousand 
fdic deposit premiums 
in recent years  the fdic has made several modifications to its deposit insurance premium structure  the most important of which was to calibrate premiums based on the total assets versus total deposits of insured institutions 
this has tended to benefit smaller regional banks such as ours  that typically maintain a higher ratio of deposits to total assets than the large  money center banks 
in  after a several year period in which banks were charged no or very low premiums for deposit insurance  the fdic resumed charging financial institutions an fdic deposit insurance premium  under a new risk based assessment system 
under this system  institutions in risk category i the lowest of four risk categories paid a rate based on a formula of to cents per of assessable deposits 
during  both of our banks qualified for the cent per assessment rate 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of allowed eligible insured depository institutions to share a one time assessment credit pool of approximately billion 
our credit amounted to thousand 
the credit was available to offset fdic insurance premiums beginning in  but not to offset the fico bond assessment 
the one time credit fully offset our fdic insurance premiums for and offset approximately thousand of our thousand fdic premiums 
in  in response to a growing level of claims against the bank insurance fund  resulting from the first stages of the financial crisis  the fdic announced that it would raise the lowest rate from cents to cents per of assessable deposits  which increase remained in effect through in addition  beginning with the second quarter of  the fdic added four new factors to the assessment rate calculation  including factors for brokered deposits  secured liabilities and unsecured liabilities 
in  in light of extraordinary demands on the fdic s insurance fund  the fdic imposed a special assessment on all insured institutions  including our banks  at 
of total assets as adjusted for tier capital 
we charged thousand to earnings in the second quarter of for this assessment  which was paid on september  in the fourth quarter of  the fdic collected prepaid assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and our prepaid assessment amounted to million 
the expense is being ratably recorded over the respective periods as directed by the fdic 
in february of  the fdic finalized a new assessment system that took effect in the second quarter of the final rule changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity  adopted a new large bank pricing assessment scheme  and set a target size for the deposit insurance fund 
the changes went into effect in the second quarter of the rule as mandated by dodd frank finalizes a target size for the deposit insurance fund at of insured deposits 
it also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the fund reaches so that the average rate over time should be about basis points and  in lieu of dividends  provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches and 
also as mandated by dodd frank  the rule changes the assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a bank s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 
the new assessment system significantly lowered our fdic insurance assessments in  which decrease by over from the first quarter of and we are unable to predict whether or to what extent the fdic may elect to impose additional special assessments on insured institutions in upcoming years  although it is commonly understood that the fdic insurance fund may not be adequate if bank failures continue at significant levels for any significant period of time and or the cost to the fdic of the bank failures recently resolved by it should prove even greater than was initially anticipated

competition we face intense competition in all markets we serve 
traditional competitors are other local commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan institutions and credit unions  as well as local offices of major regional and money center banks 
like all banks  we encounter strong competition in mortgage lending from a wide variety of other mortgage originators  all of whom are principally affected in this business by the rate and terms set  and the lending practices established by the very large and growing government supported entities fannie mae and freddie mac  who purchase and or guarantee a very substantial dollar amount and number of mortgage loans  which in accounted for a large majority of the total amount of mortgage loans extended in the us additionally  non banking financial organizations  such as consumer finance companies  insurance companies  securities firms  money market and mutual funds and credit card companies offer substantive equivalents of the various other types of loan and financial products and transactional accounts that we offer  even though these non banking organizations are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and capital requirements that apply to us 
under federal banking laws  such non banking financial organizations not only may offer products comparable to those offered by commercial banks  but also may establish or acquire their own commercial banks

risk factors our financial results and the market price of our stock in future periods are subject to risks arising from many factors  including the following please note that the discussions below regarding potential impact on arrow of certain of these factors that may develop in the future are not meant to provide predictions by arrow s management that such factors will develop  but to acknowledge the possible impact that could occur if the factors do develop 
difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial services industry 
for many financial institutions  dramatic declines in the us housing market over the past three years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values 
to date  the impact of these adverse market conditions has been less significant on arrow than it has been on many other us financial institutions 
write downs at many of these other institutions  initially of asset backed securities but spreading to other securities and loans  have caused a number of those institutions to seek additional capital  to reduce or eliminate dividends  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including to other financial institutions 
generally  in the financial services sector  this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies at many institutions  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity 
although this turmoil has affected arrow and our local markets less than certain other institutions and markets  the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has already  to some extent  adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
market developments may continue to negatively affect consumer confidence levels and demand for loans  and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may increase our charge offs and provision for credit losses 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on arrow and others in the financial institutions industry 
we may be adversely affected by new and enhanced government regulation  especially the new rules promulgated under the dodd frank act 
even before the recent financial crisis and the new banking laws and regulations resulting therefrom  including the dodd frank act  we were subject to extensive federal and state banking regulations and supervision 
banking regulations are intended primarily to protect our depositors funds and the federal deposit insurance funds  not the company s shareholders 
regulatory requirements affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in the imposition of limitations on our operations that would adversely impact our profitability and could  if capital levels dropped significantly  result in our being required to cease or scale back our operations or raise capital at inopportune times or unsatisfactory prices 
on top of the preexisting regulatory structure  the recent changes in governing law  regulations and regulatory practices have already imposed  and likely will continue to impose  substantial additional costs on us and thereby hurt our revenues and profitability 
dodd frank has already required us to adopt substantial additional practices and procedures in the normal day to day operation of our business  and many of the new and most onerous rules and regulations required by dodd frank  including new capital requirements that may be substantially enhanced from the current requirements  have not yet been implemented or in some cases even proposed 
in many case  even the general structure of the new regulations required to be issued under dodd frank is unclear 
this uncertainty is a concern 
at this time  it is difficult to predict the extent to which the dodd frank or the resulting regulations and rules may adversely impact the company 
it is reasonably certain  however  that dodd frank will increase our costs  require us to modify certain strategies and business operations  and require us to revise our capital and liquidity structures  which  individually or collectively  may very well have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
if economic conditions  already weak  should worsen and the us experiences a prolonged economic slump  the company s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable loan losses at the balance sheet date 
our allowance for loan losses is based on our historical loss experience as well as an evaluation of the risks associated with our loan portfolio  including the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio and other factors 
if the economy in our geographic market area  northeastern region of new york state  should deteriorate or enter into a prolonged state of recession  this may have an additional adverse impact on our loan portfolio 
if the quality of our portfolio should weaken due to this impact  our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses  and future enhanced provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect financial results 
moreover  loan portfolio difficulties often accompany difficulties in other areas of our business  including growth of our business generally  thereby compounding the negative effects on earnings 
a sustained and or significant increase in domestic interest rates could negatively affect the company s net interest income 
an institution s net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest  including short term and long term rates and the relationship between the two 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond our control  including general economic conditions  policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies such as the federal reserve board  and actions taken by foreign central banks 
like all financial institutions  the company s balance sheet is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
although both short and long term interest rates have remained at very low levels for the past several years  and the federal reserve has recently announced that its goal is to keep rates in the us at these low levels at least through  there is a widespread concern that the rapid growth in the money supply  another development actively promoted by the federal reserve and other central banks in the western world  will eventually lead to a surge in inflation in the us and other developed nations  including in the cost of borrowed funds ie  interest rates 
any such development ie  a rising rate environment in the ie may negatively affect banks profitability 
see the discussion under changes in net interest income due to rate  on page of this report 
if economic conditions worsen significantly and the us financial markets should suffer another downturn  the company may experience limited access to credit markets 
as discussed under part i  item d liquidity  the company has relationships with various third parties to provide overnight and longer term credit arrangements 
if and as these third parties may themselves have difficulty in accessing their own credit markets  we may  in turn  experience a decrease in our capacity to borrow funds from them or other third parties traditionally relied upon by banks for liquidity 
if the value of real estate in our market area were to suffer an additional material decline  a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under collateralized  which might have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition to considering the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of borrowers  we often secure loans with real estate collateral  which in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower 
if mortgaged real property deteriorates in value significantly during the time the credit is outstanding and we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt  our earnings and capital could be adversely affected 
furthermore  the possibility of legislative changes at the federal or state level adversely impacting the ability of banks to protect themselves when loans begin to go bad  including through foreclosure proceedings  may result in negative impacts to those institutions 
if securities prices should significantly decline in upcoming periods  we likely will experience a reduction in income from fiduciary activities 
the most significant portion of the income we earn from managing assets in our fiduciary capacity is tied to the market value of those assets  ie  investment securities 
if stocks or other equity securities lose market value  in a sudden market crash as was experienced in  we may see our fiduciary income substantially reduced 
we are subject to the local economies where we operate  and unfavorable economic conditions in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends upon the growth in business activity  income levels and deposits in our geographic market area 
unpredictable and unfavorable economic conditions unique to our market area may have an adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio and financial performance 
as a community bank  we are less able than our larger regional competitors to spread the risk of unfavorable local economic conditions over a larger market area 
although our market area northeastern new york state has not been severely damaged by the financial downturn of the past three years as many other areas of the us  this could change in future period if the us economy generally continues to suffer 
moreover  we cannot give any assurances that we  as a single enterprise  will benefit from any unique and favorable economic conditions in our market area  even if they do occur 
current levels of market volatility 
the market for certain investment securities  including mortgage backed securities  has been highly volatile or inactive  and may not stabilize or resume in the near future 
this volatility can result in significant fluctuation in the prices of those securities  some of which we hold in our investment portfolio  which could affect the results of our operations 
changes in accounting standards may materially impact the company s financial statements 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board fasb changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in changes to previously reported financial statements 
specifically  changes in the fair value of our financial assets could have a significant negative impact on our asset portfolios and indirectly on our capital levels the company s business could suffer if it loses key personnel unexpectedly or fails to provide for an orderly management succession 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to retain our key personnel for the duration of their expected terms of service  and to arrange for an orderly succession of other  equally skilled personnel 
competition for the best people in our business can be intense 
while our board of directors actively reviews succession plans  any sudden unexpected change at the senior management level may adversely affect our business 
the company relies on other companies to provide key components of the company s business infrastructure 
third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections  network access and mutual fund distribution 
these parties are beyond our control  and any problems caused or experienced by these third parties  including their not being able to continue to provide their services to us or performing such services poorly  could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and conduct our business 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect arrow 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty and other relationships 
arrow has exposure to many different counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  other commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other financial institutions 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  could lead to market wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by arrow or by other institutions and organizations 
many of these transactions expose arrow to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  arrow s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by arrow cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due arrow 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
the company faces continuing and growing security risks to its own information base and to information on its customers 
the computer systems and network infrastructure that we use are always vulnerable to unforeseen disruptions  including theft of confidential customer information identity theft and interruption of service as a result of fire  natural disasters  explosion  general infrastructure failure or cyber attacks 
these disruptions may arise in our internally developed systems  the systems of our third party service providers or originating from our consumer and business customers who access our systems from their networks or digital devices 
information security risks have increased significantly in recent years because of the increased use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions using new digital devices 
this risk is further enhanced due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime  hackers  terrorists and other disreputable parties 
these cyber attacks and security breaches can occur through our customers systems when connected to our network  or through retailers or other businesses where our customers use bank cards to purchase goods or services 
we regularly assess and attempt to improve our security systems and disaster preparedness  including back up systems  but the risks are substantially escalating 
as a result  cybersecurity and the continued enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems  data and networks from attacks or unauthorized access remain a priority 
accordingly  we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or exposures 
our stock price may begin to reflect market volatility more closely than it has in the past 
our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors  including actual or anticipated variations in our operating results  recommendations by securities analysts  significant acquisitions or business combinations  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  new technology used or services offered by our competitors  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  and changes in government regulations 
many of these factors that may adversely affect our stock price are less reflective of our particular condition or operating results than general market fluctuations  industry wide factors or general economic or political conditions and events  including terrorist attacks  economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes  credit loss trends or currency fluctuations

there are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions  which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies the allowance for loan losses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may make it difficult for borrowers to meet their contractual obligations 
any downward trend in the economy  regional or national  may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses resulting in a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition at the same time that other areas of our operations  including new loan originations and assets under administration in our trust department may also be experiencing negative pressures from the same underlying negative economic conditions 
liabilities for retirement plans we have a variety of pension and retirement plans 
liabilities under these plans rely on estimates of future salary increases  numbers of employees and employee retention  discount rates and long term rates of return on plan investments 
changes in these assumptions due to changes in the financial markets  the economy  our own operations or applicable law and regulation may result in material changes to our liability for postretirement expense  with consequent impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets accounting standards require a reduction in the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is  in part  based on an estimate of future taxable income 
goodwill accounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
other than temporary decline in the value of debt and equity securities accounting standards require that  for individual securities classified as either available for sale or held to maturity  an enterprise shall determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
when an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the amount of the other than temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss 
if we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
any significant economic downturn might result  and historically have on occasion resulted  in an other than temporary impairment in securities held in our portfolio 
valuation methods for securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis most of the available for sale portfolio  which includes us treasury and agency securities  mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal securities  corporate debt and equity securities are priced using industry standard models that consider various assumptions that include time value  yield curves  volatility factors  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity  current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
substantially all of these assumptions are either observable in the marketplace  derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
municipal and corporate securities are valued using a type of matrix  or grid  pricing in which securities are benchmarked against the treasury rate based on credit rating 
these model and matrix measurements are classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the following discussion and analysis focuses on and reviews our results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and our financial condition as of december  and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the selected quarterly and annual information set forth above and the consolidated financial statements and other financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
when necessary  prior year financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
a 
overview summary of financial results we reported net income for of million  representing diluted earnings per share eps of  essentially unchanged from our results 
return on average equity roe for the year continued to be strong at  although down from the roe of for the year 
return on average assets roa for continued to be strong at  although down from roa of for both decreases were principally due to our shrinking net interest margin  which led to a decrease in our net interest income  despite the fact that our earning assets grew and our asset quality remained strong 
total assets were billion at december   which represented an increase of million  or  above the billion level at december  stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the year earlier level 
the components of the change in stockholders equity since year end are presented in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity on page  and are discussed in more detail in the last section of this overview on page entitled  increase in stockholder equity 
regulatory capital at period end  we continue to exceed all current regulatory minimum capital requirements at both the holding company and bank levels  by a substantial amount 
as of december  both of our banks  as well as our holding company  qualified as well capitalized under federal bank regulatory guidelines 
our regulatory capital levels have consistently remained well in excess of required minimums during recent years  despite the economic downturn  because of our continued profitability and strong asset quality 
even if the new  enhanced capital requirements set forth in the proposed basel iii accords  currently under consideration by the group of advanced nations including the united states  were presently in effect  arrow and its banks would meet all of these new  enhanced capital standards 
see capital resources new capital standards to be promulgated and current capital standards on page  and important proposed changes to regulatory capital and liquidity standards on page economic recession and loan quality during the early stages of the economic crisis in late and early  our market area of northeastern new york was relatively sheltered from the widespread collapse in real estate values and general surge in unemployment 
this may have been due  in part  to the fact that our market area had been less affected by the preceding real estate bubble than other areas of the us as the recession became stronger and deeper through late  even northeastern new york began to feel the impact of the worsening national economy reflected in a slow down in regional real estate sales and increasing unemployment rates 
from year end and through most of  we experienced a very modest decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio  although by standard measures our portfolio continued to be significantly stronger than the average for our peer group of us bank holding companies with billion to billion in total assets see page for peer group information 
by year end  however  our loan quality began to stabilize  a trend that continued through during this period  although nonperforming loans increased slightly  charge offs decreased 
nonperforming loans were million at december   an increase of million from year end the increase was primarily attributable to one large commercial loan that we modified during while it was still performing 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to period end loans at december  was  an increase from 
at december  by way of comparison  this ratio for our peer group was at december   which was a significant improvement for the peer group from the ratio of at year end  but still very high when compared to the ratio of at december  loans charged off net of recoveries against our allowance for loan losses was a very low thousand for  as compared to thousand for at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  representing of total loans  an increase of basis points from december  since the onset of the financial crisis in  we have not experienced significant deterioration in any of our three major loan portfolio segments commercial loans current unemployment rates in our region are higher than in the past few years and the total number of jobs has decreased  but these trends are largely attributable to a scaling back of local operations on the part of a few large corporations having operations in our service area 
commercial property values have not shown significant deterioration 
we update the appraisals on our nonperforming and watched commercial properties as deemed necessary  usually when the loan is downgraded or when we perceive significant market deterioration since our last appraisal 
residential real estate loans we have not experienced a notable increase in our foreclosure rates  primarily due to the fact that we never have originated or participated in underwriting high risk mortgage loans  such as so called alt a  negative amortization  option arm s or negative equity loans 
we originate all of the residential real estate loans held in our portfolio and apply conservative underwriting standards to all of our originations 
indirect consumer lending primarily automobile loans these loans comprise approximately of our loan portfolio 
throughout and  we did not experience any significant change in our delinquency rate or level of charge offs on these loans  although both delinquencies and charge offs did increase modestly during recent legislative developments the following recent legislation is and will continue to be particularly important to us 
i dodd frank act as a result of the recent financial crisis that significantly damaged the economy and the financial sector of the united states  the us congress passed and the president signed the dodd frank act on july  while many of the act s provisions will not have any direct impact on arrow  some of the sections will significantly impact our business operations and likely will affect our financial results 
these include the establishment of a new regulatory body known as the bureau of consumer financial protection  which will operate as an independent entity within the federal reserve system and is authorized to issue rules for consumer protection  some of which likely will significantly restrain banks profitability  including our banks 
dodd frank also directs the federal banking authorities to issue new capital requirements for banks and holding companies which must be at least as strict as the existing capital requirements and may be much more onerous 
see the discussion under important proposed changes to regulatory capital and liquidity standards on page of this report 
dodd frank also provided that any new issuances of trust preferred securities trups by bank holding companies with between million and billion in assets will no longer be able to qualify as tier capital  although previously issued and outstanding trups of such small to medium sized bank holding companies  including arrow s million of trups that are currently outstanding  will continue to qualify as tier capital until maturity or redemption 
many of the regulations required to be promulgated by bank regulators in order to give effect to dodd frank s provisions have yet to be promulgated or are pending final approval by the regulators  and will have phase in periods even after final promulgation 
the following are some of the dodd frank legal changes that are likely to have a material impact  positive or negative  as the case may be  on us and our customers fdic deposit insurance has been substantially expanded 
the fdic insurance assessment on banks is now asset based  not deposit based  which actually reduces insurance costs for most smaller institutions  like arrow 
under the new method  our premiums were reduced from thousand of fdic and fico assessments for the first quarter of the last quarter under the old deposit based method of assessment  to thousand of expense for the second quarter of  a decline of 
expansion of consumer protection regulations likely will add to our regulatory compliance expense and reduce our income 
limitation on debit card interchange fees  which technically applies only to the very large banks having more than billion in assets  will most likely have a negative impact on the fee income of smaller banks like ours  due to competitive pressures 
rules still in the formulation process include those related to short term borrowing disclosures  retention of a portion of loans initiated and sold and executive compensation 
several of these issues are highly controversial  and the implementing regulations to be forthcoming will be the focus of much discussion and concern 
for further information on the impact of the dodd frank act and other recent legislation developments  see recent legislative developments on page of this report  above 
ii health care reform in march  comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was passed under the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the act 
included among the major provisions of the act  is a change in tax treatment of the federal drug subsidy paid with respect to eligible retirees 
the act contains provisions that may impact the company s accounting for some of its benefit plans in future periods 
however  we do not currently expect that impact to be material 
the exact extent of the act s impact  if any  cannot be determined until final regulations are promulgated and additional interpretations of the act become available 
the company will continue to monitor the effect of the act on its benefit plans 
liquidity and access to credit markets we did not experience any liquidity problems or special concerns during and  and have not in through the date of this report 
the terms of our lines of credit with our correspondent banks  the fhlbny and the federal reserve bank  have not changed  except for some increases in the maximum borrowing capacity see our general liquidity discussion on page 
in general  we rely on asset based liquidity ie  funds in overnight investments and cash flow from maturing investments and loans with liability based liquidity as a secondary source overnight borrowing arrangements with our correspondent banks  fhlbny overnight and term credit arrangement advances and the federal reserve bank discount window  as our main sources 
during the recent financial crisis  many financial institutions  small and large  relied extensively on the fed s discount window to support their liquidity positions  but we did not 
in a few well publicized instances at the height of the crisis  liquidity was such a problem for particular institutions that they experienced a run on deposits  even though there was no reasonable expectation that depositors would lose any of their insured deposits 
we maintain  and periodically test  a contingent liquidity plan whose purpose is to ensure that we can generate an adequate amount of available funds to meet a wide variety of potential liquidity crises  including a severe crisis 
fdic special assessment prepayment in the fdic announced during the second quarter of that they would levy a special assessment on all fdic insured financial institutions to rebuild the fdic s insurance fund which was significantly depleted by bank failures during the crisis 
for most insured banks including ours  the special assessment was set as a designated percentage of the institution s adjusted assets total assets less tier capital  as opposed to a percentage of covered deposits which is how the fdic had historically set regular assessments 
institutions were instructed to estimate and accrue the special assessment expense in the second quarter of we determined that our expense was thousand  which we accrued on june  during the third quarter of the fdic announced that it would not impose any additional special assessments in the remainder of  but would generate additional cash for the insurance fund by requiring insured institutions to prepay in the fourth quarter of their projected regular assessments for the fourth quarter of and all of  and our prepayment amount was million  which is being amortized  as required by bank regulatory guidance  into expense during the relevant periods to which such assessment relates 
as a result of dodd frank  beginning with the second quarter of  the calculation of regular fdic insurance premiums for insured institutions has changed so as to be based on adjusted assets as defined rather than deposits  which had the effect of imposing fdic insurance fees not only on deposits but on other sources of funding as well  including repurchase agreements 
the rate  however  given the larger base assets on which insurance premiums are now assessed  will be a lower percentage than the rate that applied under the old deposit based assessments 
the fdic calculated the first asset based assessment for the second quarter of  but recognized during the third quarter of  based on june  reported assets 
because our banks  like most small banks  have a much higher ratio of deposits to assets than the large banks maintain  we expected our fdic premiums to actually decrease considerably 
visa transactions from to on march   visa inc distributed to its member banks  including glens falls national  by way of a mandatory redemption of of the visa class b shares held by the member banks  some of the proceeds realized by visa from the initial public offering and sale of its class a shares just then completed 
with another portion of the ipo proceeds  visa established a billion escrow fund to cover certain  but not all  of its continuing litigation liabilities under various antitrust claims  which its member banks would otherwise be required to bear 
accordingly  during the first quarter of  we recorded the following transactions a pre tax gain of thousand from the mandatory redemption by visa from us of of our class b visa inc shares  reflected as an increase in noninterest income 
a reversal of thousand of the thousand accrual previously recorded by us at december   representing our then estimated proportional share of visa litigation costs  which reversal was reflected as a reduction in other operating expense 
in october  visa announced that it had settled a lawsuit with discover financial services  which was part of the covered litigation including several cases for which the visa member banks remained contingently liable and for which visa had established its escrow fund 
since that time  visa has deposited the following additional amounts into the escrow fund for covered litigation billion in december  million in july  million in may  million in october  million in march and billion in february these developments reduced our proportionate exposure for covered litigation but also reduced the ultimate value of our remaining class b visa shares  as visa s settlement of covered litigation claims directly reduces the value of member banks class b stock 
however  even before visa made these additional provisions against its covered litigation expenses  we did not recognize any dollar value for our remaining class b shares  in accordance with sec guidance 
in summary  we did not recognize any income or expense in any of the periods presented as a result of visa s periodic deposits of additional amounts into the escrow fund or settlements of covered litigation with amounts drawn out of the fund 
in october  visa announced that the so called interchange litigation was expected to go to trial sometime in the fall of at that time  visa was not able to predict when the litigation would be resolved 
the estimation of our proportionate share of any potential losses on visa s part  in excess of the escrow fund  related to the remaining covered litigation is extremely difficult and involves a high degree of uncertainty 
management has determined that the remaining thousand liability included in other liabilities on our december  consolidated balance sheet represents the fair value of our proportionate share of the remaining covered visa litigation obligations in excess of the escrow fund at that date  but this value is subject to change depending upon future developments in the covered litigation 
increase in stockholders equity at december   our tangible book value per share calculated based on stockholders equity reduced by intangible assets including goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to  an increase of  or  from december  our total stockholders equity at december  increased over the year earlier level  and our total book value per share increased by over the year earlier level 
this increase principally reflected the following factors i million net income for the period  ii a million net unrealized gain in securities available for sale  net of tax  and iii issuance of million of common stock in connection with our acquisition of two insurance agencies  offset in part by iv cash dividends of million  and v repurchases of our own common stock of million 
as of december   our closing stock price was  resulting in a trading multiple of to our tangible book value 
from a regulatory capital standpoint  the company and each of its subsidiary banks also continued to remain classified as well capitalized at quarter end 
the board of directors declared and the company paid quarterly cash dividends of 
per share for the first three quarters of  as adjusted for a stock dividend distributed september   and cash dividends of 
per share for the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of b 
results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  highlights the factors that had the greatest impact on our results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest  dividends and fees earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin 
as described in the section entitled use of non gaap financial measures on page of this report we calculate net interest income on a tax equivalent basis using a marginal tax rate of

changes between periods are attributed to movement in either the average daily balances or average rates for both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

following two years of decreases in net interest income in and during a period of rising interest rates  we experienced four successive years of increases in net interest income from through in each of these years  we experienced a benefit from an increase in average earning assets  although the substantial increase in net interest income in was largely attributable to a widened margin during the earlier portion of the year  typical of a period in which interest rates begin to fall  as our paying liabilities reprice downwards more quickly than our earning assets 
from through  however  our net interest margin has been consistently under pressure and has generally declined 
the decrease in net interest income was million  or  from to net interest income increased million  or  from to in  an increase in average earning assets  net of a smaller increase in average interest bearing liabilities ie  changes in volume had a million positive impact on net interest income  while changes in rates provided a million negative impact on our net interest income for the year  as yields on earning assets decreased more rapidly than rates paid on liabilities  the latter being more constrained by the rapid approach of zero as an absolute limit on short term  no or very low risk rates ie  the federal funds rate 
generally  the following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate general interest rate changes  the ratio of our rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap during periods of interest rate changes  and changes in the level of nonperforming loans 
impact of interest rate changes changes in interest rates in recent years

in september  however  in response to a sudden weakening in the economy and a loss of liquidity in the short term credit market  precipitated in large part by the collapse in the housing market and resulting problems in subprime residential real estate lending  the fed began lowering the federal funds target rate  rapidly and by significant amounts 
by the december meeting of the board of governors  the fed funds rate had decreased basis points  to  and in early  the fed  in response to continuing liquidity concerns in the credit markets  further lowered the targeted federal funds rate by an additional basis points  to 
in the ensuing year  the fed in a series of additional rate reductions lowered the target rate to the maximum extent possible  by january  the fed funds target rate was at an unprecedented low of to  where it has remained for the last quarters  that is  through december  recently  the fed announced that it would continue to follow policies intended to keep both the fed funds rate and the rates for longer maturity treasury bills at their current historic low levels at least through we saw an immediate impact in the reduced cost of our deposits when rates began to fall at year end  and our deposit costs continued falling in and and to a lesser extent throughout and yields on our earning assets have also fallen since  but at a different pace than our cost of funds 
initially  the drop in our asset yields was not as significant as the decline in our deposit rates  but in recent periods throughout  and the decline in yields on our earning assets has exceeded the decline in cost of our deposits 
as a result of these trends  our net interest margins generally increased in late and early  positively impacting our net interest income  but since we  like almost all banks  have experienced fairly steady contraction in our net interest margin 
changes in the yield curve in recent years 
an additional important aspect in recent years with regard to the effect of prevailing interest rates on our profitability has been the changing shape in the yield curve 
a positive upward sloping yield curve  where long term rates significantly exceed short term rates  is both a more common occurrence and generally a better situation for banks  including ours  than a flat or less upwardly sloping yield curve 
we  like many banks  typically fund longer duration assets with shorter maturity liabilities  and the flattening of the yield curve directly diminishes the benefit of this strategy 
from mid to mid  the yield curve flattened  especially during and the first half of after the fed began increasing short term interest rates in june  the yield curve did not maintain its traditional upward slope ie  lower rates for shorter duration debt  higher rates for longer term debt but flattened  that is  as short term rates increased  longer term rates stayed unchanged or even decreased 
therefore  the traditional spread between short term rates and long term rates essentially disappeared 
in late and in early  the yield curve actually inverted  with short term rates exceeding long term rates 
the flattening of the yield curve was the most significant factor in the decrease in our net interest margin during the period 
at the end of the second quarter of  however  the yield on longer term securities began to increase compared to short term investments  and the yield curve began to resume its more traditional upward sloping shape 
the increase in rate spread between short and long term maturities was further enhanced when long term rates initially held steady after the fed began lowering short term rates in september in response to the economic downturn 
ultimately  as the crisis deepened  long term rates also began to decrease  while short term rates continued to decrease  roughly in parity with each other  to the historically low levels that both short and long term rates presently occupy  levels that the federal reserve explicitly seeks to perpetuate  at least through  through the various means at its disposal 
in the third quarter of  the federal reserve undertook new measures specifically to reduce longer term rates as compared to short term rates  as a means of stimulating the housing market and the economy generally 
thirty year mortgage rates did subsequently fall to levels not seen in many years  if ever 
the yield curve  however  remains upward sloping and may continue that way for some time  which should be of some benefit to banks and financial institution generally 
on the other hand  all lending institutions  even those like us who have avoided subprime lending problems and continue to maintain high credit quality  have experienced some pressure on credit quality in recent periods  and this may continue if the national or regional economies continue to be weak 
any credit or asset quality erosion will reduce or possibly outweigh the benefit we may experience from the combination of low prevailing interest rates generally and a continuing upward sloping yield curve 
thus  no assurances can be given on future improvements in our net interest income or net income generally  particularly as residential mortgage related borrowings have diminished across the economy and the redeployment of funds from maturing loans and assets into similarly high yielding asset categories has become progressively more difficult 
recent pressure on our net interest margin 
in september  as noted above  the fed began lowering short term interest rates in response to the worsening economy 
from the third quarter of through mid our margin steadily improved as the rates we paid on our interest bearing liabilities began to reprice downward more rapidly than the yields on our earning assets 
this initially had a significant positive impact on our net interest income  but that trend eventually reversed itself 
from mid into  our net interest margin held steady at around  but the margin began to narrow in the last three quarters of and throughout and as the downward repricing of paying liabilities began to slow while interest earning assets continued to reprice downward at a steady rate 
during the past five quarters  our net interest margin has ranged from to 
however  even if new assets do not continue to price downward  our average yield on assets may continue to decline in future periods as our older  higher priced assets continue to mature and pay off at a faster rate than newer  lower priced assets 
thus  our margins may continue to be under pressure and we may experience slow compression in upcoming periods 
that is  our average yield on assets may decline in upcoming periods at a slightly higher rate than our average cost of deposits 
in this light  no assurances can be given that our net interest income will resume the growth experienced in and prior years  even if asset growth continues or increases  or that net earnings will continue to grow  if net interest income decreases more than other forms of net income increase 
potential inflation  effect on interest rates and margins 
currently  there is considerable discussion  and some disagreement  about the possible or even likely emergence of meaningful inflation across some or all asset classes in the us and world economies 
to the extent that such inflation may occur  or in fact already be occurring  it is widely perceived as attributable in large part to the persistent efforts of the federal reserve and other central banks  including the european central bank  to significantly increase the money supply in the us and western world economies  which started at least in the us at the onset of the crisis in and continues 
the fed has increased the us money supply by setting and maintaining the fed funds rate at historically low levels with consequent downward pressure on all rates  and by purchasing massive amounts of us treasuries and other debt securities through the federal reserve bank ie  quantitative easing  which is intended to have the identical effect of lowering and reinforcing already low interest rates and thereby expanding the supply of credit 
although the fed discontinued its quantitative easing program on june   and expressed at the time no immediate plans to resume the program  partially out of concern that the preceding rapid growth in the money supply might cause a sudden surge in inflation  the underlying rate of inflation in the us  exclusive of the historically volatile categories of fuel and food purchases  remained quite low in the ensuing months of and the us economy continues to be sluggish 
as a result  in the third quarter of  the fed signaled a renewed interest in spurring the economy through interest rate manipulations  including the introduction of operation twist  under which the fed began to reinvest the proceeds from all maturing securities in its substantial us treasury and mortgage backed securities portfolios into longer dated securities  thereby seeking to lower long term rates and mortgage rates  as a priority over further reductions in short term rates 
the extent to which this step served to stimulate the economy was unclear as of year end  but us inflation remained at or below the fed s target rate of 
consequently  as of the date of this report  many analysts are of the opinion that the fed may yet resume quantitative easing  that is  resume a broad based program of buying us treasuries and mortgage backed securities for the fed s portfolio using newly created funds  if it deems that step as necessary to reignite the economy  even at the cost of increased inflation 
there remains  consequently  some concern that increased inflation may emerge at some future date  leading to a possible increase in prevailing interest rates in the us financial markets 
at least for the present  management does not anticipate near term substantial increases in prevailing rates 
if modest rate increases should occur  there is some expectation that the impact on our margins  as well as on our net interest income and earnings  may be somewhat negative in the short run but possibly positive in the long run 
given the extraordinary forces currently in play in the financial markets  any speculation on the likely impact of inflation on prevailing interest rates  short or long term  or on the net interest margins or the net interest income of banks such as ours  or speculation on the depth or sustainability of inflationary pressures themselves  must be regarded as highly subjective and no undue reliance should be placed thereon 
a discussion of the models we use in projecting the impact on net interest income resulting from possible changes in interest rates vis vis the repricing patterns of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposits total assets earning assets to total assets to in general  an increase in average earning assets has a positive impact on net interest income 
for  average earning assets increased million or over  while average interest bearing liabilities increased million or 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income  even though our net interest margin decreased by basis points from to between the two years 
this positive effect was more than offset by the million negative impact on net interest income resulting from the changes in rates during the year  discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in the average balance of our securities portfolio  while the average balance of total loans actually decreased from to within the loan portfolio  our three principal segments are residential real estate loans  indirect loans primarily automobile loans and commercial loans 
through all of we sold a significant portion of our residential real estate loan originations leading to a decrease in the average balance of that portfolio 
the average balance of our indirect portfolio also decreased over the past year reflecting both the weak demand for new vehicles and our pricing on these loans which  although competitive with the rates charged by other commercial banks  was not competitive with the subsidized  below market loan rates offered by the financing affiliates of the automobile manufacturers 
of the three basic sectors in our loan portfolio residential consumer  indirect automobile  and commercial commercial real estate  only our commercial loan portfolio experienced growth over the past year 
consequently  most of the growth in our earning assets in was in our lower yielding investment portfolio versus the higher yields in our loan portfolio and in any event such growth  in total earning assets  was only in versus in 
the million increase in average interest bearing liabilities reflected the offsetting impact of an million increase in interest bearing deposits and a million decrease in our other borrowed funds  primarily fhbl term advances 
to for  average earning assets increased million or over  while average interest bearing liabilities increased million or 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income  even though our net interest margin decreased by basis points from to between the two years 
this million positive effect during resulting from a change in volume was offset  in part  by the million negative impact on net interest income resulting from the changes in rates during the year  discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  an increase of million  or  in investment securities and a increase in the level of bank balances at interest 
within the loan portfolio  our three principal segments are residential real estate loans  indirect loans primarily automobile loans and commercial loans 
the increase in average loan balances from to was principally driven by a strong demand for residential real estate loans 
however  during the last six months of we began to sell our newly originated loans to freddie mac while retaining the loan servicing 
some of these sales were refinancing of loans that were formerly in our own portfolio 
consequently  the outstanding balance of residential real estate loans began to decrease in the fourth quarter of  continuing into the early part of average indirect loan balances decreased slightly during the year  under  while average commercial loans balances remained essentially flat 
the million increase in average interest bearing liabilities was evenly divided between increases in municipal deposits balances and non municipal account balances 
the fact that our average earning assets increased more than our average paying liabilities  was attributable to an increase in non interest bearing funding sources  including non interest bearing demand deposits  and increases in stockholders equity 
increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition 
ii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses we consider our accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy  given the uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the material effect that such judgments may have on our results of operations 
beginning in  note to our consolidated financial statements includes all of the disclosures about our method for calculating our provision for loan losses that was formerly reported in this section of managements discussion and analysis

noninterest income the majority of our noninterest income constitutes fee income from services  principally fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  insurance commissions  and other recurring fee income 
net gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale is another category of noninterest income 
analysis of noninterest income dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount income from fiduciary activities fees for other services to customers net gain on securities transactions other than temporary impairment otti on investment securities net gain on sale of merchant bank card processing income from restitution payment insurance commissions net gain on sales of loans other operating income total noninterest income compared to total noninterest income in the just completed year was million  an increase of million  or  from total noninterest income of million for the total for both the and periods included net gains on securities transactions of million and million  respectively 
however the additions of the upstate and mcphillips insurance agencies in had the greatest impact on the increase in noninterest income 
our insurance commissions increased by million or between the two comparative periods 
assets under trust administration and investment management at december  were million  down somewhat from the prior year end balance of million 
however  income from fiduciary services for increased by thousand  or  above the total for  primarily because the average dollar amount of assets under trust administration during exceeded the average dollar amount during the year end total of assets under administration for was lower than the year end total for because  at the end of the third quarter of  the us stock markets experienced a sharp downturn  the average for  however  continued to exceed the average 
a significant portion of our fiduciary fees is indexed to the dollar amount of assets under administration 
any significant downturn in the us stock markets in future periods would likely have a corresponding negative impact on our income from fiduciary activities 
fees for other services to customers primarily service charges on deposit accounts  revenues related to the sale of mutual funds to our customers by third party providers and servicing income on sold loans were million for  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase between the two periods in fees for other services to customers was attributable to an increase in revenues derived from third party mutual fund sales and to an increase in income from debit card transactions  which increased from million for to million for effective october  visa announced debit interchange rates and related modifications to comply with new debit regulatory requirements 
this reduced rate structure is expected to result in a slight reduction in our fee income 
however  debit card usage by our customers continues to grow which is expected to partially offset the reduced rates 
we do not believe that the new law s limits on debit transaction interchange fees will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods 
these two increases were offset  in part  by a decrease in fee income from service charges on deposit accounts 
insurance commissions first became a significant source of noninterest income for us following our acquisition of an insurance agency  capital financial group  inc capital financial specializes in selling and servicing group health care policies as well as life insurance 
on april   we acquired a second insurance agency  loomis lapann  inc  which sells property and casualty insurance to retail customers in our service area and sports insurance products to various sports organizations 
in february of  we acquired our third insurance agency  the upstate agency  also a property and casualty insurance agency  and in august we acquired and consolidated two affiliated insurance agencies  the mcphillips agencies  also sellers of property and casualty insurance 
all of these acquired agencies do business within the service areas of our banks 
we expect that noninterest income from insurance commissions will continue to represent a growing portion of our net income in upcoming periods  both absolutely and as a percentage of our total net income  as a result of our recent expansion of this line of business and possible future expansion by acquisition  if favorable opportunities should arise 
starting with the third quarter of  we began to resell most of our newly originated residential real estate loans into the secondary market ie  to freddie mac  which generates additional noninterest income in the form of net gains on sales of loans 
we are unable to predict at what rate we may continue to resell loan originations in future periods versus holding such loans and thereby augmenting our own portfolio 
much depends on the volume of originations  the rates attaching thereto  the ready availability of sale thereof into the secondary market and the pricing of such sales 
we generally retain servicing rights for loans originated and sold by us  which generates additional noninterest income fees for other services to customers 
other operating income includes net gains on the sale of other real estate owned as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
compared to total noninterest income decreased thousand  or  from to two significant transactions involving noninterest income that occurred in were the net gain on the sale of our merchant bank card processing to transfirst in the first quarter of and  the write down of an inactively traded common stock in other transactions are listed in the table on page for  income from fiduciary activities increased thousand  or  from the increase reflected a recovery in the dollar amount of assets under administration  largely a result of the general rebound in the us equity and debt markets during at period end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from period end a significant portion of our fiduciary fees are indexed to the market value of assets under administration 
fees for other services to customers primarily service charges on deposit accounts  revenues related to the sale of mutual funds to our customers by third party providers and servicing income on sold loans were million for  a decrease of thousand  or  from the decrease between the two periods in fees for other services to customers was in part the result of a modest decline in revenues derived from third party mutual fund sales 
the decrease also reflected the fact that the total for the period included income from our merchant credit card processing business prior to our sale of that business at the end of the first quarter of  no income from that business was earned by us in income from debit card transactions increased from million for to million for as noted in the foregoing section  compared to  insurance commissions first became a significant source of noninterest income for us following our acquisition of capital financial group  inc  an insurance agency specializes in selling and servicing group health care policies as well as life insurance  but was augmented as a source of income in april  when we acquired a second insurance agency  loomis lapann  inc  which sells primarily property and casualty insurance 
this second agency acquisition led to an increase in our noninterest income from insurance commissions between and the volume of our sales of loan originations decreased after the second quarter of until the third quarter of  when we resumed reselling most of our newly originated residential real estate loan originations into the secondary market ie  to freddie mac 
thus  our total net gains on sales of loans lagged on total by approximately 
other operating income includes net gains on the sale of other real estate owned as well as other miscellaneous revenues

noninterest expense noninterest expense is a means of measuring the delivery cost of services  products and business activities of a company 
the key components of noninterest expense are presented in the following table 
analysis of noninterest expense dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense of premises  net furniture and equipment expense fdic special assessment fdic regular assessment amortization of intangible assets prepayment penalty on fhlb advances other operating expense total noninterest expense compared to noninterest expense for amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from however  the period includes a million prepayment penalty from our prepayment of million of fhlb advances 
for  our efficiency ratio was 
this ratio  which is a commonly used non gaap financial measure in the banking industry  is a comparative measure of a financial institution s operating efficiency 
the efficiency ratio a ratio where lower is better  as we define it  is the ratio of operating noninterest expense excluding intangible asset amortization and the fhlb prepayment penalty to net interest income on a tax equivalent basis plus operating noninterest income excluding net securities gains or losses 
see the discussion on page of this report under the heading use of non gaap financial measures 
the efficiency ratio as defined by the federal reserve board and reported for banks in its peer holding company performance reports excludes net securities gains or losses from the denominator as does our calculation  but unlike our ratio does not exclude intangible asset amortization from the numerator  and thus tends to result in higher ratios than our definition 
our efficiency ratios in recent periods compared favorably to the ratios of our peer group  even as adjusted to add intangible asset amortization back into the numerator of our ratio ie  into our operating noninterest expense 
for  our peer group ratio was  and our ratio not adjusted was 
the financial results for include i five months of operations for the mcphillips agency  which we acquired on august   ii eleven months of operations for upstate agency  which we acquired on february   and iii a full year of operations for loomis and lapann  which we acquired on april  the results for the prior year do not reflect any expense or income attributable to either upstate or mcphillips  and only nine months of operations for loomis and lapann 
all categories of noninterest expense  including amortization  experienced increases from the acquisition of the agencies in and in mid year except for fdic and fico assessments and the fhlb prepayment penalty 
thus  both the increase in noninterest expense for  as well as in noninterest income for the year  discussed above  reflect expenses and income attributable to the recently acquired agencies 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased by million  or  from to all full time equivalent employees of the agencies acquired in continued employment with us after the acquisitions and the related expense is included in the expense total  but not the expense total 
occupancy expense increased from to the increase was primarily attributable to increases in net rental expense  including offices rented by the recently acquired agencies 
the increase in furniture and equipment expense was primarily attributable to data processing and equipment maintenance expenses 
arrow s banks and its subsidiaries sustained little or no physical damage due to tropical storm irene in august allowing us to provide uninterrupted banking and financial services to our customers 
risk based fdic assessments have increased since in response to the current financial crisis 
in the completed quarter  we continued to pay the lowest possible rate 
beginning with the second quarter of  the risk based calculation for the premium converted to the new fdic method  a method based on adjusted assets rather than deposits 
that resulted in a decrease in our fdic insurance expense from the first quarter of to the second quarter of other operating expense remained essentially unchanged from this was the result of offsetting increases and decreases among a variety of operating categories 
compared to noninterest expense for amounted to million  an increase of thousand  or  from for  the efficiency ratio for arrow was  an increase from the ratio of 
a similar ratio total overhead expense to adjusted tax equivalent operating income is presented in the federal reserve board s bank holding company performance report for december  our ratio   compared favorably to the ratio for our peer group of 
for information on the calculation of our efficiency ratios  see pages and of this report 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased thousand  or  from to salary expense increased thousand  or  from  due primarily to staff increases from our acquisition of loomis fte s and to normal merit increases 
employee benefits actually decreased slightly from year to year due to a decrease in pension expenses resulting from an increase in the expected investment return on the pension plan assets 
the ratio of total personnel expense salaries and employee benefits to average assets was for  basis points lower than the annualized ratio for our peer group of at december  occupancy expense increased thousand  or  from to the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in building maintenance costs 
furniture and equipment expense increased by thousand  or  from to the increase was primarily attributable to increases in data processing expenses 
changes in our fdic insurance assessment and the fdic special assessment were discussed earlier on page other operating expense increased from to  by thousand  or 
the increase was spread across a variety of operating expenses  most notably  legal and professional fees  telephone and director fees

loan portfolio the amounts and respective percentages of loans outstanding represented by each principal category on the dates indicated were as follows a 
types of loans dollars in thousands december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial commercial real estate construction commercial real estate other consumer other consumer automobile residential real estate total loans allowance for loan losses total loans  net maintenance of high quality in the loan portfolio in the second half of and throughout most of  the us experienced significant disruption and volatility in its financial sector and capital markets 
a major cause of the disruption was a significant decline in residential real estate values across much of the us  which  in turn  triggered widespread defaults on subprime mortgage loans and steep devaluations of portfolios containing these loans and securities collateralized by them 
in mid  as real estate values continued to fall in most areas of the us  problems spread from subprime loans to better quality mortgage portfolios  and in some cases prime mortgage loans  as well as home equity and credit card loans 
in addition  in mid to late  commercial real estate values also began to decline and commercial real estate mortgage portfolios began to experience the same problems that previously beset residential mortgage portfolios 
in  the decline in residential and commercial property values eased in many markets  at least temporarily  due in part to federal tax incentive programs which encouraged home purchases 
however  in late and through  the general decline in residential property values resumed in many markets  which continues to the present 
the continuing damage to asset portfolios remains a serious concern  which has been offset somewhat  particularly for larger diversified financial organizations  by the general stabilization in the equity markets following the sudden collapse of the markets in early and the subsequent sharp rebound in late and early nevertheless  many lending institutions large and small have suffered sizable charge offs and losses in their loan portfolios since as a result of their origination of or investment in residential and commercial real estate loans 
for a variety of reasons  we have largely been spared the negative impact on asset quality that many banks have suffered 
through the date of this report  we have not experienced a significant deterioration in our loan portfolios 
in general  we underwrite our residential real estate loans to secondary market standards for prime loans 
we have never engaged in subprime mortgage lending as a business line and we do not extend or purchase any so called alt a  negative amortization  option arm  or negative equity mortgage loans 
on occasion we have made loans to borrowers having a fico score of or below or have had extensions of credit outstanding to borrowers who have developed credit problems after origination resulting in deterioration of their fico scores 
we also on occasion have extended community development loans to borrowers whose creditworthiness is below our normal standards as part of the community support program we have developed in fulfillment of our statutorily mandated duty to support low and moderate income borrowers within our service area 
however  we are a prime lender and apply prime lending standards and this  together with the fact that the service area in which we make most of our loans has not experienced as severe a decline in property values or economic conditions generally as other parts of the us  are the principal reasons that we have not to date experienced significant deterioration in our loan portfolio  including the real estate categories of our loan portfolio 
if  however  the current weakness in the us economy persists or worsens  our region will continue to be negatively impacted from an economic and financial standpoint  and despite our conservative underwriting standards we may experience elevated charge offs  higher provisions to our loan loss reserve  and increasing expense related to asset maintenance and supervision 
residential real estate loans in recent years  residential real estate and home equity loans have represented the largest single segment of our loan portfolio comprising approximately of the entire portfolio at year end  eclipsing both indirect loans of the portfolio and our commercial and commercial real estate loans 
our gross originations for residential real estate loans were million  million and million for the years   and  respectively 
during the last quarter of and the first two quarters of  as prevailing mortgage rates began to decline  we sold most of our mortgage originations in the secondary market 
during the second half of and the first two quarters of  for a variety of reasons  we once again began to retain most of the newly originated residential real estate loans in our loan portfolio  selling only a relatively small portion of the originations to freddie mac with further reductions in the portfolio as a result of normal principal amortization and prepayments on pre existing loans 
after april  rates on conventional real estate mortgages continued to fall  even as demand for such mortgages other than refinancings remained relatively weak 
in april  the national average for year conventional fixed rate mortgage loans was  but by the last quarter of the national average had dropped below  a relative decline of more than percent 
in response  we determined to resume selling most of our originations to freddie mac  amounting to million for the last half of and million for all of if the current low rate environment for newly originated residential real estate loans persists  we may continue to sell a significant portion of our loan originations and  as a result  may even experience a decrease in our outstanding balances in this segment of our portfolio 
moreover  if our local economy or real estate market suffers further major downturns  the demand for residential real estate loans in our service area may decrease  which also may negatively impact our real estate portfolio and our financial performance 
indirect consumer loans primarily automobile loans at december   indirect consumer loans primarily automobile loans originated through dealerships located primarily in the eastern region of upstate new york represented the third largest category of loans in our portfolio  but still a significant component of our business 
in the early post years  indirect loans were the largest segment of our loan portfolio 
for much of this period  these loans also were the fastest growing segment of our loan portfolio  both in terms of absolute dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
however  in the last quarter of and the first two quarters of  we encountered enhanced rate competition on auto loans from other lenders  principally  the finance affiliates of the auto manufacturers who increased their offerings of heavily subsidized  low or zero rate loans 
this increasingly competitive environment  combined with softening demand for vehicles  especially for suvs and light trucks  had a tempering effect on our indirect originations  and we actually experienced decreases in these balances in the first two quarters of during the last two quarters of  our share of the local indirect auto loan market increased somewhat as many of the major lenders in the indirect market  including the auto companies financing affiliates  pulled back on their bargain rate lending programs 
our portfolio at december  exceeded the balance at december  by million  or 
however  in  despite the fact that automobile sales nationwide rose modestly adjusting for the mid year spike in sales under the federally subsidized cash for clunkers program  our outstanding balances of indirect loans steadily declined from month to month 
the reason was a combination of moderately competitive pressures on rates and a general weakening in the creditworthiness of loan applicants during the year 
our ending balance at december  was million  or  below the year end balance 
originations of indirect loans for were approximately million  a decrease of million  or  from in the second quarter of  we introduced more competitive financing rates and as a result experienced some growth in our indirect loan balances in both the second and third quarters of  before balances declined again in the fourth quarter of overall  our originations for were approximately million 
these indirect loan originations represented an increase of million  or  over the originations for during  the borrowers on the newly originated indirect loans had an average credit score at origination of over for  our originations of indirect loans were million  a decrease of million  or  from the total for prepayments and normal amortization during the quarter exceeded our originations  and as a consequence the outstanding balance of our automobile loan portfolio decreased by million  or  during in  net charge offs for our automobile loans were less than our net charge offs for the period 
our experienced lending staff not only utilizes credit evaluation software tools but also reviews and evaluates each loan individually 
we believe our disciplined approach to evaluating risk has contributed to maintaining our strong loan quality in this portfolio 
however  if weakness in auto demand persists  our portfolio is likely to experience limited  if any  overall growth  either in real terms or as a percentage of the total portfolio  regardless of whether the auto company affiliates are offering highly subsidized loans 
continuing weak demand for vehicle loans could negatively impact our financial performance 
commercial  commercial real estate and construction and land development loans over the last several years  we have experienced moderate and occasionally strong demand for commercial and commercial real estate loans 
these loan balances have generally increased  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio 
however  in response to the crisis  demand for commercial loans began to ease and our outstanding balances at the end of were essentially unchanged from year end during  commercial loan demand began to revive in our market area and our balances increased by million  or nearly 
in our balances grew at a respectable pace  increasing by million  or at an annualized rate of 
substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans in our portfolio are extended to businesses or borrowers located in our regional market 
many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime  fhlbny rates or us treasury indices 
although on a national scale the commercial real estate market suffered a major downturn in the period from which it has not fully recovered  we have not experienced any significant weakening in the quality of our commercial loan portfolio in recent years 
it is entirely possible that we may yet experience a reduction in the demand for such loans and or a weakening in the quality of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio in upcoming periods 
generally  however  the corporate sector  at least in our service area  appears to be in reasonably good financial condition at present  except for the most highly leveraged business enterprises  to whom we normally do not extend credit of any sort 
our greatest risk in our loan portfolio at present is not credit risk but interest rate risk  as rate compression for high quality credits steadily erodes our ability to maintain healthy margins while protecting the strong quality of our loan portfolio 
the following table indicates the changing mix in our loan portfolio by including the quarterly average balances for our significant loan products for the past five quarters 
the remaining quarter by quarter tables present the percentage of total loans represented by each category and the annualized tax equivalent yield of each category 
loan portfolio quarterly average loan balances dollars in thousands quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity consumer loans automobile other consumer loans total loans percentage of total quarterly average loans quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity consumer loans automobile other consumer loans total loans quarterly tax equivalent yield on loans quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity consumer loans automobile other consumer loans total loans other consumer loans includes certain home improvement loans secured by mortgages 
however  these same loan balances are reported as residential real estate in the table of period end balances on page  captioned types of loans 
as the yield table above indicates  average rates across our portfolio have steadily declined over the last quarters  in direct response to the fed s maintaining historically low interest rates in its attempt to revive the economy  coupled with a general moderation of loan demand on the part of corporate and individual customers 
for the fourth quarter of the average yield on our loan portfolio declined by basis points from the fourth quarter of  from to 
the decrease was exacerbated by extremely competitive pressures on rates for new commercial and commercial real estate loans as well as automobile loans and the decreasing rate environment generally 
the yields on new year fixed rate residential real estate loans the choice of most of our mortgage customers remained very low during the quarter  so we continued to sell most of those originations to the secondary market  specifically  to freddie mac 
while average yields on the portfolio were dropping in  our margins were also compressing 
the decrease in average yield on our loan portfolio of basis points was basis points greater than the basis point decline in our average cost of deposits from the last quarter of to the last quarter of we expect that average loan yields will continue to decline at a somewhat faster rate than our average cost of deposits  although further declines in yields for newly originated loans will likely be more limited  and represent a slower rate of decline in yields  than what we experienced in in general  the yield tax equivalent interest income divided by average loans on our loan portfolio and other earning assets has been impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates  as previously discussed in this report beginning on page under the heading impact of interest rate changes 
we expect that such will continue to be the case  that is  that loan yields will continue to rise and fall with changes in prevailing market rates  although the timing and degree of responsiveness will be influenced by a variety of other factors  including the extent of federal government and federal reserve participation in the home mortgage market  the makeup of our loan portfolio  the shape of the yield curve  consumer expectations and preferences  and the rate at which the portfolio expands 
additionally  there is a significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all loan categories  and this cash flow reprices at current rates as new loans are generated at the current yields 
thus  even if prevailing rates do not fall significantly or at all in upcoming periods  our average rate on our portfolio may continue to decline as older credits in our portfolio mature and roll over or are redeployed into lower priced loans 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and interest rate structure of our commercial and commercial real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms 
demand loans and overdrafts are included in the within year maturity category 
most of the real estate construction loans are made with a commitment for permanent financing  whether extended by us or unrelated third parties 
the maturity distribution below reflects the final maturity of the permanent financing

as of december   our total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to million 
in addition to these instruments  we also have issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
c 
risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the amounts of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans for the past five years are presented in the table on page under the heading summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status either due to the delinquency status of principal and or interest or a judgment by management that the full repayment of principal and interest is unlikely 
loans secured by home equity lines of credit are put on nonaccrual status when days past due  residential real estate loans when days past due  commercial and commercial real estate loans are evaluated on a loan by loan basis and are placed on nonaccrual status when days past due if the full collection of principal and interest is uncertain 
under the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy established by banking regulators  fixed maturity consumer loans not secured by real estate must generally be charged off no later than when days past due 
loans secured with non real estate collateral in the process of collection are charged down to the value of the collateral  less cost to sell 
open end credits  residential real estate loans and commercial loans are evaluated for charge off on a loan by loan basis when placed on nonaccrual status 
we had no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are those loans which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
the balance of loans days past due totaled million at december  and represented of loans outstanding at that date  as compared to approximately million  or of loans at december  these non current loans at december  were composed of approximately million of consumer loans  principally indirect automobile loans  million of residential real estate loans and million of commercial and commercial real estate loans 
prior to june  banking regulators excluded modified consumer loans from the amount financial institutions were required to report as restructured loans 
beginning with the second quarter of  all modified loans  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  are reported as restructured loans in compliance with modified terms  unless the restructured loan is on nonaccrual status and is included with the reported amount of nonaccrual loans 
we evaluate nonaccrual loans over thousand and all troubled debt restructured loans individually for impairment 
all our impaired loans are measured based on either i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent 
we determine impairment for collateralized loans based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
we determine the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis 
our method for measuring all other loans is described in detail in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
beginning in  the loan note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page now contains the detailed information on modified loans and impaired loans  that was formerly described in this section 
potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  we apply an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either past due or fully performing but exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
periodically we review the loan portfolio for evidence of potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrower causes doubt about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future 
through our on going credit monitoring  we consider loans which  in our internal classification system  are classified as substandard but continue to accrue interest to be potential problem loans 
at december   we identified commercial relationships totaling million as potential problem loans 
at december   we identified commercial relationships totaling million as potential problem loans 
factors such as payment history  value of supporting collateral  and personal or government guarantees led us to conclude that the current risk exposure on these loans did not warrant accounting for the loans as nonperforming 
although in a performing status as of year end  these loans exhibited certain risk factors  which have the potential to cause them to become nonperforming at some point in the future 
the overall level of our performing loans that demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state  which in turn are impacted at least in part by economic conditions in the us generally 
on both the regional and national level  economic conditions are much weaker at present than was the case in the and earlier periods 
if weak economic conditions persist  potential problems loans likely will increase

during average deposit balances increased by million  or  over the average for the increase was generated from our pre existing branch network 
we did not sell or close any branches during the covered period   although we did move our salem branch to a better location 
we did not hold any brokered deposits during  and the following table presents the quarterly average balance by deposit type for each of the most recent five quarters 
deposit portfolio quarterly average deposit balances dollars in thousands quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits now accounts savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits fluctuations in balances of our now accounts and time deposits of  or more are largely the result of municipal deposit fluctuations 
municipal deposits on average represent to of our total deposits 
municipal deposits are typically placed in now accounts and time deposits of short duration 
many of our municipal deposit relationships are subject to annual renewal  by formal or informal agreements 
in general  there is a seasonal pattern to municipal deposits starting with a low point during july and august 
account balances tend to increase throughout the fall and into the winter months from tax deposits and receive an additional boost at the end of march from the electronic deposit of state funds 
in addition to these seasonal fluctuations within types of accounts  the overall level of municipal deposit balances fluctuates from year to year as some municipalities move their accounts in and out of our banks due to competitive factors 
often  the balances of municipal deposits at the end of a quarter are not representative of the average balances for that quarter 
for a variety of reasons  including the seasonality of municipal deposits  we typically experience little net growth or a small contraction in average deposit balances in the first quarter of each calendar year  versus significant growth in the second and fourth quarters 
deposit balances followed this general pattern for  enhanced by the addition of new municipal account relationships throughout the year 
we also experienced growth in our non municipal account balances  primarily in now accounts and money market savings accounts 
we typically experience a shift within the mix of deposit categories during periods of significant interest rate increases or decreases 
during periods of falling rates and very low rates  like the period from mid through the end of  depositors tend to transfer maturing time deposits to nonmaturity interest bearing deposit products 
this continued during at december  time deposits represented of total deposits  down from at december  this was the lowest level since june  when it was and compares to a high of at june  we expect this shift from time deposits to nonmaturity deposit products to slow down or continue  if rates remain at their current low levels 
the total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below percentage of total quarterly average deposits quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits now accounts savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits time deposits of  or more are to a large extent comprised of municipal deposits and are typically obtained on a competitive bid basis 
quarterly cost of deposits quarter ended dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits now accounts savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits in general  rates paid by us on various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by our competitors  which in turn are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve bank 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of our deposit liabilities  although this lag is normally shorter than the lag between federal reserve rate actions and the repricing of our loans and other earning assets 
as demonstrated in the table above  we experienced a steady decrease in the cost of our deposits in each of the past quarters following the period of falling interest rates from mid through the end of although some maturing time deposits will continue to reprice at lower rates in forthcoming periods  the favorable reduction in the cost of deposits may not continue since most of our time deposits have already repriced to current rates and the rates on our nonmaturity deposit balances have already been reduced to or nearly to the lowest sustainable levels 
we do not use brokered deposits as a regular funding source and there were not any such balances carried during  or the maturities of time deposits of  or more at december  are presented below

liquidity our liquidity is measured by our ability to raise cash when we need it at a reasonable cost 
we must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to our customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  we must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
overnight investments in federal funds sold  interest bearing bank balances at the federal reserve bank  and cash flow from investment securities and loans  both from normal repayment cash flows and prepayments  and the ability to quickly pledge a substantial portion of our available marketable investment securities and loans to obtain funds  represent our primary sources of available liquidity 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
our securities available for sale portfolio was million at year end due to the potential for volatility in market values  we are not able to assume that large quantities of such securities could be sold at short notice at their carrying value to provide needed liquidity 
but  if market conditions are favorable resulting in unrealized gains in the available for sale portfolio  we may pursue modest sales of such securities conducted in an orderly fashion to provide needed liquidity 
in addition to liquidity from short term investments  investment securities and loans  we have supplemented available liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as federal funds lines of credit and credit lines with the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny 
we have established federal funds lines of credit with three correspondent banks totaling million  but did not draw on those lines during through our borrowing relationship with the fhlbny  we have pledged collateral  including mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage loans 
our unused borrowing capacity at the fhlbny was at december  during  we used this facility for a short period 
the average balance of these overnight advances was million for the average balance in other short term borrowings for consisted entirely of treasury  tax and loan balances at the federal reserve bank of new york  but by year end the federal reserve had canceled this program 
in addition  we have identified brokered certificates of deposit as an appropriate off balance sheet source of funding accessible in a relatively short time period 
also  our two bank subsidiaries have each established a borrowing facility with the federal reserve bank of new york  pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential discount window advances 
at december   the amount available under this facility was million  but there were no advances then outstanding 
we measure and monitor our basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements 
based on the level of overnight funds investments  available liquidity from our investment securities portfolio  cash flow from our loan portfolio  our stable core deposit base and our significant borrowing capacity  we believe that our liquidity is sufficient to meet funding needs that may arise in connection with any reasonably likely events or occurrences 
during the past several quarters  our liquidity position has been strong  as depositors and investors in the wholesale funding markets have shown no hesitations on placing or maintaining their funds with our banks 
in addition  management has consciously maintained a strong liquidity position by emphasizing its short maturity asset portfolios  including cash and due from banks  as opposed to investments in longer term assets which might generate slightly higher rates but rates that are still historically low for the maturities in question 
the financial markets have been challenging for many financial institutions  and in the view of many  lack of liquidity has been as great a problem as capital shortage 
as a result  liquidity premiums have widened and many banks have experienced certain liquidity constraints  including substantially increased pricing to retain deposit balances 
because of arrow s favorable credit quality and strong balance sheet  arrow has not experienced any significant liquidity constraints through the date of this report and has not been forced to pay premium rates to obtain retail deposits or other funds from any source 
important proposed changes to regulatory capital and liquidity standards in december   the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee released a comprehensive list of proposals for changes to capital and liquidity requirements for banking institutions commonly referred to as basel iii 
in july  the basel committee announced the design for its new capital and liquidity standards 
these new basel iii capital and liquidity standards  when finalized  will affect our holding company and our banks  because they will be incorporated or reflected  directly or indirectly  in the new bank regulatory capital and liquidity requirements to be imposed in upcoming years by us bank regulators on us banks under us banking law  specifically  under the provisions of the dodd frank act requiring enhanced bank capital and liquidity levels 
that is  the basel ii capital and liquidity standards  when promulgated  will be important for us as well as for our banking competitors 
in september  the oversight body of the basel committee announced minimum capital ratios and transition periods that provide for the following i a new tier common equity standard requiring a minimum ratio of common equity to total risk weighted assets of to be phased in by january   with common equity defined to include essentially only paid in common stock amounts and retained earnings  ii an increased minimum tier capital ratio of  up from of risk weighted assets to be phased in by january   iii an additional minimum capital buffer of tier common equity equal to of total risk weighted assets to be phased in between january  and january   which will bring the minimum tier common equity ratio to and the minimum tier capital ratio to  and iv a minimum leverage ratio of to be tested starting january  
the proposals also narrow the definition of capital  excluding instruments that no longer qualify as tier common equity as of january   and phasing out from the definition of capital certain other instruments  including trups  over several years 
the liquidity proposals under basel iii include i a liquidity coverage ratio to become effective january   and ii a net stable funding ratio to become effective january  
each of these liquidity ratios  if implemented in accordance with the preliminary proposals disseminated by the bank regulatory authorities  may prove extremely challenging to banks generally  although the precise construction of the proposed liquidity measures remains very uncertain 
many of the details of basel iii s new minimum capital ratios will remain uncertain until the committee s proposals are ultimately reviewed and ratified by the group of finance ministers 
the final form of the liquidity measures is even more uncertain and subject to significant change in the rule promulgation process 
the final provisions of basel iii  as thus approved  must await final implementing regulations by us regulators before they go into effect 
the dodd frank act directs us regulators to promulgate new capital and liquidity guidelines for banking institutions and implicitly directs that the new guidelines should comply at a minimum with the final basel iii standards 
see the discussion of new capital standards in the capital resources and dividends section  below 
because of the uncertainty surrounding these new capital and liquidity requirements  we are not able to predict at this time the content thereof or the impact that any changes in regulation may have on the company 
e 
capital resources and dividends stockholders equity stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end 
the most significant positive changes to stockholders equity included a net income of million  b net unrealized gains in the valuation allowance for available for sale securities of million  net of tax  c equity received from our various stock based compensation plans of million  offset  in part by d a net retirement plan losses reflected as a component of other comprehensive income of million  e cash dividends of million  and f purchases of our own common stock of million 
stock repurchase program at its annual meeting in april  the board of directors approved a month stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase  at the discretion of senior management  of up to million of arrow s common stock over the ensuing one year period in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
this program replaced a similar million stock repurchase program approved one year earlier  in april  of which amount approximately million was used to make repurchases prior to replacement of the program with the program 
by december   nearly the entire million of repurchases authorized under the april program had been expended  whereupon the board of directors authorized a new million stock repurchase program  effective january   substantially identical to the april program  which would expire to the extent unused in months  ie  by year end december as under the april program  management may affect stock repurchases under the january program from time to time in upcoming periods  to the extent that it believes the company s stock is reasonably priced and such repurchases appear to be an attractive use of available capital and in the best interests of stockholders 
at march   no shares had been acquired under the new program 
regulatory capital the following discussion of capital focuses on regulatory capital ratios  as defined and mandated for financial institutions by federal bank regulatory authorities 
regulatory capital  although a financial measure that is not provided for or governed by gaap  nevertheless has been exempted by the sec from the definition of non gaap financial measures in the sec s regulation g governing disclosure by registered companies of non gaap financial measures 
thus  certain information which is generally required to be presented in connection with our disclosure of non gaap financial measures need not be provided  and has not been provided  for the regulatory capital measures discussed below 
new capital standards to be promulgated the discussion and disclosure below on regulatory capital is qualified in its entirety by reference to the fact that the dodd frank act  among other financial reforms  directed the federal bank regulatory authorities to promulgate new capital standards for all financial institutions  including banks like ours 
these standards when adopted by regulators must be at least as strict ie  must establish minimum and target capital levels that are at least as high as the preexisting regulatory capital standards for us financial institutions or  if higher  any commonly accepted capital standards then in effect for financial institutions in the advanced economies generally  as defined in dodd frank 
the latter reference is generally understood as embracing the new  enhanced financial institution capital requirements that are currently being drafted and reviewed by the financial regulators for a consortium of the world s most advanced nations  including the us  and are expected to be implemented  in whole or in part  by those nations 
these proposed new capital requirements  commonly known as basel iii  currently await final approval by the advanced nations the group of  but will be implemented by the participating nations  to the extent implemented  only over a relatively protracted time period 
the basel iii standards  if approved and included in the new us bank capital standards  ultimately may require significantly higher minimum levels of capital for us financial institutions when fully implemented 
see the discussion under important proposed changes to regulatory capital and liquidity standards  above on page of this report 
current capital standards our holding company and our subsidiary banks are currently subject to two sets of regulatory capital measures  risk based capital guidelines and a leverage ratio test 
the risk based guidelines assign risk weightings to all assets and certain off balance sheet items of financial institutions  which generally results in a substantial discounting of low risk or risk free assets  that is  a significant dollar amount of such assets disappears from the balance sheet 
the guidelines then establish an minimum ratio of qualified total capital to risk weighted assets 
at least half of total capital must consist of tier capital  which comprises common equity and common equity equivalents  retained earnings  a limited amount of permanent preferred stock and for holding companies a limited amount of trust preferred securities see the discussion below on these securities  less intangible assets  net of associated deferred tax liabilities 
up to half of total capital may consist of so called tier capital  comprising a limited amount of subordinated debt  other preferred stock  certain other instruments and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the second regulatory capital measure  the leverage ratio test  establishes minimum limits on the ratio of tier capital to total tangible assets  without risk weighting i 
e  discounting 
for top rated companies  the minimum leverage ratio currently is  but lower rated or rapidly expanding companies may be required by bank regulators to meet substantially higher minimum leverage ratios 
federal banking law mandates certain actions to be taken by banking regulators for financial institutions that are deemed undercapitalized as measured under regulatory capital guidelines 
the law establishes five levels of capitalization for financial institutions ranging from well capitalized the highest ranking to critically undercapitalized the lowest ranking 
federal banking law also ties the ability of banking organizations to engage in certain types of non banking financial activities to such organizations continuing to qualify as well capitalized under these standards 
trust preferred securities under dodd frank in each of and  we issued million of trust preferred securities trups in a private placement 
under the federal reserve board s pre existing rules on regulatory capital  trups typically would qualify as tier capital for bank holding companies such as ours but only in amounts up to of tier capital  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
under the recently enacted dodd frank act  trust preferred securities issued by arrow on or after the grandfathering sate set forth in dodd frank may  will no longer qualify as tier capital under the bank regulatory capital guidelines  however  our trups outstanding immediately prior to the grandfathering cutoff date set forth in dodd frank may  may continue to qualify as tier capital  until the redemption or maturity thereof 
the table below sets forth the capital ratios of our holding company and subsidiary banks  glens falls national and saratoga national  as of december  capital ratios arrow gfnb snb tier leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio at december  our holding company and both banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by the regulatory guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies see the further discussion under supervision and regulation in part i item c of this report 
although there is considerable current speculation in banking and financial circles that bank regulatory capital guidelines will likely be adjusted in forthcoming periods so as to require a greater degree of capital protection against sudden financial stress within banks  there is no consensus on what these enhanced capital standards will look like or over what period they will be imposed on the banking sectors 
the source of funds for the payment of stockholder dividends by our holding company consists primarily of dividends declared and paid to the holding company by our bank subsidiaries 
in addition to regulatory constrictions on payments of dividends  there are statutory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiaries 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to the holding company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million 
the ability of our holding company and our banks to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines and applicable laws

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we may engage in a variety of financial transactions or arrangements  including derivative transactions or arrangements  that in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions or arrangements involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions or arrangements may be used by us or our customers for general corporate purposes  such as managing credit  interest rate  or liquidity risk or to optimize capital  or may be used by us or our customers to manage funding needs 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
as of december   we had no derivative securities  including interest rate swaps  credit default swaps  or equity puts or calls  in our investment portfolio

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in our loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  our business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates interest rates or prices fees for products and services will make our position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of interest rate and market risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability oversight and control to management s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting our asset liability profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
we have not made use of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  in our risk management process 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to the risk of prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model attempts to capture the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and a basis point downward shift in interest rates  and a repricing of interest bearing assets and liabilities at their earliest reasonably predictable repricing date 
we normally apply a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period 
however  at year end the targeted federal funds rate remained where it had been since late  a range of to  with assurances from the fed that prevailing rates would remain at or near their current historically low rates at least through year end moreover  our average cost of deposits for had decreased to 
thus  for purposes of our decreasing rate simulation  we applied a hypothetical basis point downward shift in interest rates for the long end of the yield curve with hypothetical short term rate decreases equal to the lesser of basis points or such lower rate decrease required to reach zero percent 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income  and a basis point zero limit decrease in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income 
these amounts were well within our alco policy limits 
historically there has existed an inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and our net interest income  reflecting the fact that our liabilities and sources of funds generally reprice more quickly than our earning assets 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast on our part and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
we continue to believe that any downturn in prevailing interest rates will generally have a short term positive impact on our net interest margin and net interest income  which would be mitigated or perhaps reversed over the mid to longer term of ensuing rate decreases 
we also believe an upturn in increases in prevailing rates will generally have a short term negative impact on our margin and net interest income  which again would likely be mitigated or perhaps reversed as rates continue to rise over the medium or long term 
we believe that  whether rates are generally increasing  decreasing or stable  changes in the slope of the yield curve will also affect net interest income and the net interest margin 
other things being equal  a more sharply sloping upward yield curve will generally have a positive impact on our net interest income and interest margin  whereas a flattening yield curve will generally have a negative impact 
we are not able to predict with certainty what the magnitude of these effects taken together that is  changes in rates  plus changes in the yield curve would be in any particular case  especially if changes in rate and curve  taken independently  would normally work against each other eg  lower rates  combined with a flattening yield curve 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of changes in interest rates including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
