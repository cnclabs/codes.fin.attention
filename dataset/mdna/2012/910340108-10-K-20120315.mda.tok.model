item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to our business the incidence  frequency and severity of catastrophe losses are unpredictable and may adversely affect the results of our operations  liquidity and financial condition 
our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising from catastrophic events affecting multiple policyholders  which can be caused by various natural and man made disasters  including  but not limited to  hurricanes  tornadoes  windstorms  hailstorms  fires  explosions  earthquakes  tropical storms and terrorist acts 
property damage resulting from catastrophes is the greatest risk of loss we face in the ordinary course of our 
table of contents united fire group  inc form k business 
we have exposure for catastrophe losses under both our commercial insurance policies and our personal insurance policies 
in addition  our automobile and inland marine business exposes us to losses arising from floods and other perils 
longer term weather trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change  a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures  including effects on global weather patterns  greenhouse gases  sea  land and air temperature  sea levels  rain and snow 
the emerging science regarding climate change and its connection to extreme weather events is far from conclusive 
if a connection to increased extreme weather events related to climate change is ultimately proven true  this could increase the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses we experience in both coastal and non coastal areas 
because the occurrence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and may vary significantly from year to year  historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations 
in addition  as with catastrophe losses generally  it can take a long time for us to determine our ultimate losses associated with a particular catastrophic event 
as our claims experience for a particular catastrophe develops  we may be required to adjust our reserves to reflect our revised estimates of the total cost of claims 
catastrophes may also negatively affect our ability to write new business 
increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property could impact claims severity for future catastrophic events 
in addition  severity may increase after catastrophic events  as the demand for resources such as building materials and labor to repair damaged structures may inflate costs  and the amount of salvage value received for damaged property may decline 
our reserves for property and casualty insurance losses and costs related to settlement of property and casualty insurance losses and our life insurance reserves for future policy benefits may be inadequate  which would have an unfavorable impact on our financial results 
our reserves for claims and future policy benefits may prove to be inadequate  which may result in future charges to earnings and or a downgrade of our financial strength rating or the financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries 
we establish property and casualty insurance loss reserves based on assumptions and estimates of damages and liabilities incurred 
on a quarterly basis  regnier  the independent actuary for our property and casualty insurance segment  estimates property and casualty insurance product reserves based on many assumptions to validate the reasonableness of our claims reserves 
our property and casualty insurance loss reserves are only estimates  we determine the amount of these loss reserves based on our best estimate and judgment of the losses and costs we will incur on existing insurance policies 
because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves  we cannot precisely determine the ultimate amounts of benefits and claims that we will pay or the timing of payment of benefits and claims 
for a detailed discussion of our reserving process and the factors we consider in estimating reserves  refer to the critical accounting estimates section in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
actual losses and loss settlement expenses paid might exceed our reserves 
if our loss reserves are insufficient  or if we believe our loss reserves are insufficient to cover our actual loss and loss settlement expenses  we will have to increase our loss reserves and incur charges to our earnings  which could indicate that premium levels were insufficient 
these charges may be material 
griffith  the independent actuary for our life insurance segment  calculates life insurance product reserves based on our assumptions  including estimated premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policy  the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy and the amount of benefits or claims to be paid 
as such  deviations from one or more of these assumptions could result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents united fire group  inc form k the cyclical nature of the property and casualty insurance business may affect our financial performance 
the financial results of companies in the property and casualty insurance industry historically have been cyclical in nature  characterized by periods of severe price competition and excess underwriting capacity commonly referred to as soft markets  followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity commonly referred to as hard markets 
we expect these cycles to continue 
premium rates for property and casualty insurance are influenced by factors that are outside of our control  including market and competitive conditions and regulatory issues 
soft market conditions could require us to reduce premiums  limit premium increases  or discontinue offering one or more of our insurance products in one or more states  resulting in a reduction in our premiums written and in our profit margins and revenues 
the demand for property and casualty insurance can also vary significantly  rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as that activity decreases 
fluctuations in demand and competition could produce underwriting results that would have a negative impact on the results of our operations and financial condition 
we are subject to interest rate fluctuations and declines in the value of investments held in our investment portfolio due to various market factors that could negatively affect our profitability 
we are subject to the negative effects of interest rate fluctuations and to declines in the value of our investment portfolio  due to changes in market valuations and changes in credit quality related to individual investments 
some of our interest sensitive products  principally our fixed annuities  expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our spread  which is the difference between the rates we are required to pay under these contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments  intended to support our obligations under these contracts 
during periods when the interest rates paid on interest sensitive insurance products are rising  we may not be able to reinvest our invested assets to achieve the higher rate of return necessary to compensate for the higher interest rates we must pay to keep these products competitive in the marketplace 
consequently  we may have to accept a lower spread and therefore lower profitability  or face a decline in sales of these products and a loss of related assets 
during periods of declining interest rates  we may be unable to achieve similar rates of return on our maturing assets 
moreover  this risk may be exacerbated by borrowers prepaying fixed income securities  commercial mortgages  and mortgage backed securities held in our investment portfolio in order to refinance at lower rates 
because we are only entitled to reset the interest rates on our annuities at limited  pre established intervals  and because many of our annuity contracts have guaranteed interest rates  the profitability of these products could decrease or become negative 
due to the reinvestment risk described above  a decline in market interest rates available on investments could also reduce our return from investments of capital that do not support particular policy obligations  which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the adverse effect on us from fluctuations in interest rates may be exacerbated because we currently maintain  and intend to continue to maintain  a large portion percent at december  of our investment portfolio in fixed income securities  particularly corporate bonds  including our portfolio of trading securities 
the fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with changes in interest rates 
we classify the majority percent  at december  of our fixed income securities  including our entire portfolio of trading securities  as available for sale 
we report the value of those investments at their current fair value 
accordingly  fluctuations in interest rates may result in fluctuations in the valuation of our fixed income investments  which would affect our stockholders equity 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals from our life insurance and annuity products 
in periods of rising interest rates  surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts  along with policy loans  may increase as policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns 
these surrenders  withdrawals and policy loans may also require us to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  which would increase our expenses in the current period 
terrorism and the threat of terrorism within the us and abroad  ongoing military and other actions  and heightened 
table of contents united fire group  inc form k security measures  may cause significant volatility in the equity markets and in interest rates 
such activities may result in loss of life  property damage  disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets or changes in interest rates caused by these activities 
the fair value of securities in our investment portfolio may also fluctuate  depending on general economic and market conditions or events relating to a particular issuer of securities 
changes in the fair value of securities in our investment portfolio could result in realized or unrealized investment losses  thereby affecting our stockholders equity 
we are exposed to the chance that issuers of bonds that we hold will not be able to pay principal or interest when due 
defaults and other impairments may cause write downs in the value of the bonds we hold 
pervasive deterioration in the credit quality of issuers  changes in interest rate levels and changes in interest rate spreads between types of investments could significantly affect the value of our invested assets and our earnings 
continued difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
recently  concerns over the slow economic recovery  level of us national debt  the us mortgage market  inflation levels  energy costs and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and global capital markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  reduced business and consumer confidence and continued high unemployment  have negatively impacted the us economy 
these concerns expanded to include a broad range of mortgage and asset backed and other fixed income securities  including those rated investment grade 
although liquidity has improved  the market for fixed income instruments continues to experience some price volatility  credit downgrade events and elevated probabilities of default 
factors such as consumer spending  business investment  government spending  the volatility and strength of the capital markets  investor and consumer confidence and inflation levels all affect the business and economic environment and  ultimately  the amount and profitability of our business 
in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment  lower family income  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment  negative investor sentiment and lower consumer spending  the demand for our insurance products could be adversely affected 
our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether 
in addition  we may experience an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies 
adverse changes in the economy could negatively affect our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our investment portfolio contains various types of municipal bonds that expose us to the risk of default 
at december   percent of our total investment portfolio at fair value  and percent of our total fixed maturity investments at fair value  were invested in municipal bonds that are primarily tax exempt 
during or following an economic downturn  our municipal bond portfolio could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue 
the prolonged economic downturn that began in has resulted in many states and local governments operating under deficits or projected deficits 
the severity and duration of these deficits could adversely impact the collectability and valuation of our municipal bond portfolio 
unauthorized data access and other security breaches could have an adverse impact on our business and reputation 
our business and operations rely on secure and efficient processing  storage and transmission of customer and company data  including personally identifiable information 
our ability to effectively operate our business depends upon our ability and the ability of certain third parties  including vendors and business partners  to access our computer systems to perform necessary business functions  such as providing quotes and product pricing  billing and 
table of contents united fire group  inc form k processing premiums  administering claims  and reporting our financial results 
our business and operations also depend upon our ability to safeguard personally identifiable information and other confidential and proprietary information belonging to us and our policyholders 
our systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access and hackers  computer viruses  and other scenarios in which our data may be compromised 
security breaches and other improper accessing of data in our facilities  networks or databases  or those of our vendors may occur  exposing us to liability and having an adverse impact on our business 
moreover  any compromise of the security of our data could harm our reputation  which could affect our business and results of operations 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to implement security measures adequate to prevent every security breach 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues and class action litigation on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number and or size of claims 
examples of these issues include judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability 
an increase of plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers  including us  in purported class action litigation regarding claims handling and other practices 
an increase in the variety  number and size of claims relating to liability losses  which often present complex coverage and damage valuation questions 
adverse changes in loss cost trends  including inflationary pressure in medical cost and auto and home repair costs 
we are exposed to credit risk in certain areas of our operations 
in addition to exposure to credit risk related to our investment portfolio  we are exposed to credit risk in several other areas of our business operations  including credit risk relating to policyholders  independent agents  brokers and reinsurers 
in accordance with industry practice  when policyholders purchase insurance policies from us through independent agents and brokers  the premiums relating to those policies are often paid to the agents and brokers for payment to us 
in most jurisdictions  the premiums will be deemed to have been paid to us whether or not actually received by us 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with the amounts due from independent agents and brokers 
we are exposed to credit risk through our surety insurance operations  where we guarantee to a third party that our bonded principal will satisfy certain performance obligations eg  a construction contract or certain financial obligations 
if our policyholder defaults  we may suffer losses and be unable to be reimbursed by our policyholder 
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our purchase of reinsurance 
see the discussion in the risk factor titled market conditions may affect our access to and the cost of reinsurance and our reinsurers may not pay losses in a timely manner  or at all  for a discussion of the credit risk associated with our reinsurance program 
to a large degree  the credit risk we face is a function of the economy  accordingly  we face a greater risk during a period of economic downturn 
while we attempt to manage these risks through underwriting and investment guidelines  collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms  our efforts may not be successful 
for example  collateral obtained may subsequently have little or no value 
as a result  our exposure to credit risk could materially and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 

table of contents united fire group  inc form k we are subject to comprehensive state laws and regulations that pose particular risks to our ability to earn profits 
we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by the states in which we operate 
our ability to comply with these laws and regulations and obtain necessary and timely regulatory action is  and will continue to be  critical to our success and ability to earn profits 
examples of regulations that pose particular risks to our ability to earn profits include the following required licensing 
our insurance company subsidiaries  operate under licenses issued by various state insurance agencies 
if a regulatory authority were to revoke an existing license or deny or delay granting a new license  our ability to continue to sell insurance or to enter or offer new insurance products in that market would be substantially impaired 
regulation of insurance rates and approval of policy forms 
the insurance laws of most states in which we operate require insurance companies to file insurance premium rate schedules and policy forms for review and approval 
when our loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry  state regulatory authorities may resist or delay our efforts to raise premium rates in the future  even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to premium rate increases 
if premium rate increases we deem necessary are not approved  we may not be able to respond to market developments and increased costs in that state 
state regulatory authorities may even impose premium rate rollbacks or require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders  affecting our profitability 
if insurance policy forms we seek to use are not approved by a state insurance agency  our ability to offer new products and grow our business in that state could be substantially impaired 
restrictions on cancellation  nonrenewal or withdrawal 
many states have laws and regulations restricting an insurance company s ability to cease or significantly reduce its sales of certain types of insurance in that state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance agencies 
these laws and regulations could limit our ability to exit or reduce our business in unprofitable markets or discontinue unprofitable products 
for example  the state of louisiana has a law prohibiting the nonrenewal of homeowners policies written for longer than three years except under certain circumstances  such as for nonpayment of premium or fraud committed by the insured 
risk based capital and capital adequacy requirements 
our insurance company subsidiaries and affiliate  are subject to risk based capital requirements that require us to report our results of risk based capital calculations to state insurance departments and the naic 
any failure to meet applicable risk based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject us or our subsidiaries and affiliate to further examination or corrective action by state regulators  including limitations on our writing of additional business  state supervision or liquidation 
transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates 
transactions between us  our subsidiary insurance companies and our affiliates generally must be disclosed to  and in some cases approved by  state insurance agencies 
state insurance agencies may refuse to approve or delay their approval of a transaction  which may impact our ability to innovate or operate efficiently 
required participation in guaranty funds and assigned risk pools 
certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities  and joint underwriting associations where participating insurers are required to provide coverage for assigned risks 
the number of risks assigned to us by these plans is based on our share of total premiums written in the voluntary insurance market for that state 
pricing is controlled by the plan  often restricting our ability to charge the premium rate we might otherwise charge 
wherever possible  we utilize a designated servicing carrier to fulfill our obligations under these plans 
designated servicing carriers charge us fees to issue policies  adjust and settle claims and handle administrative reporting on our behalf 
in these markets  we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired premium rates  possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity 
while these facilities are 
table of contents united fire group  inc form k generally designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders  the exposure to assessments and our ability to recoup these assessments through adequate premium rate increases may not offset each other in our financial statements 
moreover  even if they do offset each other  they may not offset each other in our financial statements for the same fiscal period  due to the ultimate timing of the assessments and recoupments or premium rate increases 
additionally  certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these state funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors 
restrictions on the amount  type  nature  quality and concentration of investments 
the various states in which we operate have certain restrictions on the amount  type  nature  quality and concentration of our investments 
generally speaking  these regulations require us to be conservative in the nature and quality of our investments and restrict our ability to invest in riskier  but often higher yield investments 
these restrictions may make it more difficult for us to obtain our desired investment results 
state and federal tax laws 
under current federal and state income tax law  our life insurance and annuity products receive favorable tax treatment 
this favorable treatment may give these products a competitive advantage over other noninsurance products 
congress  from time to time  considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities 
congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities 
legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products  making them less competitive 
such proposals  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies 
terrorism risk insurance 
the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of tripra requires the federal government and the insurance industry to share in insured losses up to billion per year resulting from future terrorist attacks within the united states 
for further information about tripra and its effect on our operations  refer to the information in the results of operations section in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with these state laws and regulations requires us to incur administrative costs that decrease our profits 
these laws and regulations may also prevent or limit our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately  obtain timely premium rate increases necessary to cover increased costs  discontinue unprofitable relationships or exit unprofitable markets and otherwise continue to operate our business profitably 
in addition  our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in actions by state or federal regulators  including the imposition of fines and penalties or  in an extreme case  revocation of our ability to do business in one or more states 
finally  we could face individual  group and class action lawsuits by our policyholders and others for alleged violations of certain state laws and regulations 
each of these regulatory risks could have a negative effect on our profitability 
a reduction in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
third party rating agencies assess and rate the claims paying ability of insurers and reinsurers based on criteria established by the agencies 
our property and casualty insurers have been assigned a financial strength rating of a excellent from am best since  except for one insurance subsidiary that is in a run off status  which am best has designated as nr rating procedure inapplicable 
prior to mercer insurance group s acquisition by us  it was rated a excellent by am best since our life insurance subsidiary has been assigned a financial strength rating of a excellent from am best since our property and casualty insurance companies are rated on a group basis 
financial strength ratings are used by policyholders  insurers  reinsurers and insurance and reinsurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength of insurers and reinsurers 
these ratings are not evaluations directed to potential purchasers of our common stock and are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our common stock 
these ratings are subject to change at any time and could be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of the rating agency 
downgrades in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets or could lead to increased borrowing costs in 
table of contents united fire group  inc form k the future 
perceptions of the company by investors  producers  other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired 
we believe that the ratings assigned by am best are an important factor in marketing our products 
our ability to retain our existing business and to attract new business in our insurance operations depends on our ratings by this agency 
our failure to maintain our ratings  or any other adverse development with respect to our ratings  could cause our current and future independent agents and policyholders to choose to transact their business with more highly rated competitors 
if am best downgrades our ratings or publicly indicates that our ratings are under review  it is likely that we will not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors and our ability to sell insurance policies could decline 
if that happens  our premium revenue and earnings would decrease 
for example  many of our agencies and policyholders have guidelines that require us to have an am best financial strength rating of a or higher 
a reduction of our am best ratings below a would prevent us from issuing policies to a portion of our current policyholders or other potential policyholders with similar ratings requirements 
market conditions may affect our access to and the cost of reinsurance and our reinsurers may not pay losses in a timely manner  or at all 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for significant amounts of the risk that we and our insurance company subsidiaries and affiliate underwrite 
the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to market conditions that are beyond our control 
the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase may affect the level of our business and profitability 
although we purposely work with several reinsurance intermediaries and reinsurers  we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable premium rates 
moreover  there may be a situation in which we have more than two catastrophic events within one policy year 
because our current catastrophe reinsurance program only allows for one automatic reinstatement at an additional reinstatement premium  we would be required to obtain a new catastrophe reinsurance policy to maintain our current level of catastrophe reinsurance coverage 
such coverage may be difficult to obtain  particularly if it is necessary to do so during hurricane season following the second catastrophe 
if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities  either our net exposure to risk will increase or  if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net risk exposures  we will have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite 
although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred  it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders 
our ability to collect reinsurance recoverables may be subject to uncertainty 
our losses must meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance agreement 
reinsurers must also have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance agreement or program 
particularly  following a major catastrophic event  our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer on a timely basis  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
our geographic concentration in both our property and casualty insurance and life insurance segments ties our performance to the business  economic and regulatory conditions of certain states 
the following states provided percent of the direct statutory premium written for the property and casualty insurance segment in texas percent  iowa percent  california percent  missouri percent and louisiana percent 
the following states provided percent of the direct statutory premium written for the life insurance segment in iowa percent  minnesota percent  illinois percent  nebraska percent  and wisconsin percent 
our revenues and profitability are subject to the prevailing regulatory  legal  economic  political  demographic  competitive  weather and other conditions in the principal states in which we do business 
changes in any of these conditions could make it less attractive for us to do business in such states and would have a more pronounced effect on us compared to companies that are more geographically diversified 
in addition  our exposure to severe losses from localized natural perils  such as hurricanes or hailstorms  is increased in those areas where we have written a significant amount of property insurance policies 

table of contents united fire group  inc form k we face significant competitive pressures in our business that could cause demand for our products to fall and reduce our revenue and profitability 
the insurance industry is highly competitive 
in our property and casualty insurance business and in our life insurance business  we compete  and will continue to compete  with many major us and non us insurers and smaller regional companies  as well as mutual companies  specialty insurance companies  underwriting agencies  and diversified financial services companies 
some of our competitors have far greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
our premium revenue and our profitability could decline if we lose business to competitors offering similar or better products at or below our prices 
our profitability could also be affected by the entry of new competitors into the market and the development of new products by new and existing competitors 
we price our insurance products based on estimated profit margins  and we would not be able to significantly reduce our current estimated profit margins in the near future 
some of our competitors may be larger and have more capital than we do  and may be able to withstand significant reductions in their profit margins 
if our competitors decide to target our policyholder base by offering lower priced insurance  we may not be able to respond competitively  which could reduce our revenue and our profitability 
our business depends on the uninterrupted operations of our facilities  systems and business functions 
our business depends on our employees ability to perform necessary business functions  such as processing new and renewal policies and claims 
we increasingly rely on technology and systems to accomplish these business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion 
our inability to access our facilities or a failure of technology  telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis or affect the accuracy of transactions 
if sustained or repeated  such a business interruption or system failure could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business  serve our agents and policyholders  pay claims in a timely manner  collect receivables or perform other necessary business functions 
in the event that a natural disaster or a terrorist act occurs  our company and employees could be directly adversely affected  depending on the nature of the event 
we have an emergency preparedness plan that consists of the information and procedures required to enable rapid recovery from an occurrence  such as natural disaster or business disruption  which could potentially disable us for an extended period of time 
this plan was successfully tested during  both by the midwest flooding that affected our corporate headquarters in cedar rapids  iowa  and by hurricane ike that affected our gulf coast regional office in galveston  texas 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  as well as our access to capital and cost of capital 
although capital market conditions have improved  our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets 
we maintain a level of cash and securities which  combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations  is believed adequate to meet anticipated short term and long term benefit and expense payment obligations 
however  in the event our current internal sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs  we have entered into a million revolving unsecured credit facility that we can access 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit our access to capital required to operate our business 
such market conditions may limit our ability to replace  in a timely manner  maturing liabilities  satisfy statutory capital requirements  and access the capital necessary to grow our business 
as such  we may be forced to delay raising capital  issue shorter term securities than we prefer  utilize available internal resources or bear an unattractive cost of capital  which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility and liquidity 

table of contents united fire group  inc form k if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or services or fail to keep pace with advances in technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
the successful implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to evolving technologies and industry standards and introduce new products and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce new products  or that any new products will achieve market acceptance 
moreover  competitors may develop competitive products that could adversely affect our results of operations 
a failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we cannot adapt to changing technologies  our products and services may become obsolete  and our business could suffer 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and services  develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers and respond to technological advances on a timely and cost effective basis 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements  and  as a result  our business could suffer 
we are unable to predict the impact on us of the new federal financial regulatory reform 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act enacted in july   expands the federal presence in insurance oversight 
the dodd frank act s requirements include streamlining the state based regulation of reinsurance and nonadmitted insurance property or casualty insurance placed from insurers that are eligible to accept insurance  but are not licensed to write insurance in a particular state 
the dodd frank act also establishes a new federal insurance office within the us department of the treasury with regulatory authority over all lines of insurance except health insurance  certain long term care insurance and crop insurance 
the federal insurance office has the power to  among other things  monitor aspects of the insurance industry  identify issues in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the overall financial system  coordinate federal policy on international insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances 
the dodd frank act provides a framework for further regulation and governance initiatives 
these regulations and initiatives cover many aspects of public company governance including  but not limited to  new and enhanced executive compensation disclosures  nonbinding stockholder votes on executive compensation  new independence standards for compensation committee membership  and incentive compensation clawback policies 
because the sec has not yet completed its required rulemaking under the dodd frank act  we are unable to predict with certainty the overall impact these new regulations and initiatives will have on us 
however  the cost of compliance with new regulations and initiatives could be significant  and adversely impact our results of operations  equity  business  and insurer financial strength and debt ratings 
risks relating to our acquisition of mercer insurance group on march   we completed the acquisition of percent of the outstanding capital stock of mercer insurance group for per share in cash consideration representing million in total consideration 
we incurred significant costs and expenses in connection with the acquisition  the integration of mercer insurance group into our business operations may result in significant expenses and accounting charges  all of which will adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
during  we incurred one time transaction costs totaling million in connection with the acquisition transaction 
we expect to incur additional costs associated with the integration of mercer insurance group into our business operations 
in addition to one time transaction costs  we also incurred accounting charges related to the amortization of the value of business acquired voba asset 
voba is being amortized in the first months of 
table of contents united fire group  inc form k operations subsequent to the acquisition 
as of december   the voba asset was million  which will be fully amortized in the first quarter of we continue to integrate a large number of systems and functions  including management information  purchasing  accounting and finance  claims  underwriting  billing  payroll and benefits  fixed assets and lease administration  and regulatory compliance 
many of the expenses that will be incurred  by their nature  are impracticable to estimate 
these expenses could  particularly in the near term  exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses  the realization of economies of scale  and cost savings and revenue synergies related to the integration of the two companies 
to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by additional integration related expenses and costs  the price of our common stock could decline 
integrating mercer insurance group into our existing operations involves considerable risks and may not be successful  and we may fail to realize the potential benefits of the acquisition of mercer insurance group 
the integration of mercer insurance group into our existing operations has been a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our existing operations if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
if our management is unable to minimize the potential disruption to our business during the integration process  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition

failure to minimize the numerous risks associated with the post acquisition integration strategy also may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we incurred debt as part of the acquisition transaction 
as of december   we had a million loan outstanding 
our ability to meet our ongoing debt service obligations under this loan will depend on our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business  and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these debt arrangements  and any restrictions included therein  may have an adverse impact on our business operations and financial results and could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
integration of mercer insurance group s information technology systems with ours may result in a loss of technical support from some information technology vendors 
since the acquisition we are working to combine our data and mercer insurance group s data to a single  integrated information technology platform 
this process has involved  and will likely continue to involve  terminating the existing relationship with one or more of our or mercer insurance group s current information technology vendors 
if the integration process does not progress smoothly or within the time frame anticipated by management  we could have difficulty receiving adequate technical support from cancelled vendors who might have little incentive to continue cooperating with us

these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments to us 
at times we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock  or we may be required to seek prior approval from the applicable regulatory authority before we can pay any such dividends 
limits on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  service our debt  and make share repurchases

departure of key personnel 
certain provisions of our organizational documents  as well as applicable insurance laws  could impede an attempt to replace or remove our management  prevent the sale of the company or prevent or frustrate any attempt by stockholders to change the direction of the company  each of which could diminish the value of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws  as well as applicable laws governing corporations and insurance companies  contain provisions that could impede an attempt to replace or remove our management or prevent the sale of the company that  in either case  stockholders might consider being in their best interests 
for example our board of directors is divided into three classes 
at any annual meeting of our stockholders  our stockholders have the right to appoint approximately one third of the directors on our board of directors 
consequently  it will take at least two annual stockholder meetings to effect a change in control of our board of directors 
our articles of incorporation limit the rights of stockholders to call special stockholder meetings 
our articles of incorporation set the minimum number of directors constituting the entire board of directors at nine and the maximum at  and they require approval of holders of percent of all outstanding shares to amend these provisions 
within the range  the board of directors may increase by one each year the number of directors serving on the board of directors 
our articles of incorporation require the affirmative vote of percent of all outstanding shares to approve any plan of merger  consolidation  or sale or exchange of all  or substantially all  of our assets 
our board of directors may fill vacancies on the board of directors 
our board of directors has the authority  without further approval of our stockholders  to issue shares of preferred stock having such rights  preferences and privileges as the board of directors may determine 
section of the iowa business corporation act imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of percent or more of our common stock 
section a of the iowa business corporation act authorizes the terms and conditions of stock rights or options issued by us to include restrictions or conditions that preclude or limit the exercise  transfer  or receipt of such rights or options by a person  or group of persons  owning or offering to acquire a specified number or percentage of the outstanding common shares or other securities of the corporation 
further  the insurance laws of iowa and the states in which our subsidiary insurance companies are domiciled prohibit any person from acquiring direct or indirect control of us or our insurance company subsidiaries  generally defined as owning or having the power to vote percent or more of our outstanding voting stock  without the prior written approval of state regulators 
these provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  and these state laws governing corporations and insurance companies  may discourage potential acquisition proposals 
these provisions and state laws may also delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company  in particular through unsolicited transactions that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
as a result  efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or the company s management may be unsuccessful  and the existence of such provisions may adversely affect market prices for our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts
