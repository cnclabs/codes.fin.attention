overview we are a leader in certain technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products  services and systems 
the company is comprised of two segments architectural products and services architectural and large scale optical technologies lso 
our architectural segment companies design  engineer  fabricate  install  maintain and renovate the walls of glass  windows  storefront and entrances comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings 
businesses in this segment are viracon  inc  including glassecviracon  fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass for global markets  harmon  inc  one of the largest us full service building glass installation and renovation companies  wausau window and wall systems  a manufacturer of standard and custom aluminum window systems and curtainwall for the north american commercial construction market  linetec  a paint and anodizing finisher of architectural aluminum and pvc shutters for us markets  and tubelite inc tubelite  a fabricator of aluminum storefront  entrance and curtainwall products for the us commercial construction industry 
our lso segment consists of tru vue  inc  a manufacturer of value added glass and acrylic for the custom picture framing market 
the following are the key items that impacted fiscal the architectural segment s net sales were up percent  or percent excluding the impact of glassecviracon  which was acquired late in fiscal  over the prior year even as we continued to be impacted by difficult us commercial construction market conditions 
growth was driven by initiatives to improve market share in our metal fabrication businesses and improved pricing in our architectural glass fabrication business 
operating results were also favorable to last year largely due to the impact of the items above  partially offset by project margin declines at our installation business 
despite soft market conditions  our lso segment was able to increase net sales percent  while operating income was down slightly due to spending on growth initiatives during fiscal our backlog was million at march   compared to million at february  the architectural segment backlog represents more than percent of the backlog 
bidding activity has remained solid  however  bid to award and contract timing continues to be slow 

table of contents strategy 
the following describes our business strategy for each of our segments 
architectural segment 
our architectural segment serves the commercial construction market  which is highly cyclical 
we have five business units within this segment that participate at various stages of the glass fabrication  window and curtainwall supply chain each with nationally recognized brands and leading positions in their target market segments 
the glass and window and curtainwall systems enclose commercial buildings such as offices  hospitals  educational facilities  government facilities  high end multi family buildings and retail centers 
we believe building contractors value our ability to deliver quality  customized window and curtainwall solutions to projects on time and on budget  helping to minimize costly job site labor overruns 
their customers building owners and developers value the distinctive look  energy efficiency  and hurricane and blast protection features of our glass systems 
these benefits can contribute to higher lease rates  lower operating costs due to the energy efficiency of our value added glass  a more comfortable environment for building occupants  and protection for buildings and occupants from hurricanes and blasts 
we look at several market indicators  such as office space vacancy rates  architectural billing statistics  employment  and other economic indicators  to gain insight into the commercial construction market 
one of our primary indicators is us non residential construction market activity as documented by mcgraw hill construction mcgraw hill  a leading independent provider of construction industry analysis  forecasts and trends 
we utilize the information for the building types that we typically supply office towers  hotels  retail centers  education facilities and dormitories  health care facilities  government buildings and high end multi family buildings and adjust this information which is based on construction starts to align with our fiscal year and the lag that is required to account for when our products and services typically are initiated in a construction project approximately eight months after project start 
from the mcgraw hill data  our us markets had an annual compounded growth rate of negative percent over our past three fiscal years  consistent with our segment s domestic compounded annual growth rate over that same period 
our overall strategy in this segment is to defend and grow market share over a cycle by extending our presence while remaining focused on distinctive solutions for enclosing commercial buildings 
we draw upon our leading brands  energy efficient products and reputation for high quality and service in pursuit of our strategy 
each of our existing businesses has the ability to grow through geographic or product line expansion  and we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities in adjacent segments 
finally  we aspire to lead our markets in the development of practical  energy efficient products for green buildings and the ability to deliver them in a sustainable manner 
our architectural businesses have introduced products and services designed to meet the growing demand for green building materials 
these products have included new energy efficient glass coatings  thermally enhanced aluminum framing systems and systems with a high percentage of recycled content 
while our lag adjusted markets are projected to continue to contract slightly into fiscal  we are pursuing the same basic strategy with some adjustment for market conditions 
in fiscal we raised the pricing of our us architectural glass products to better reflect the value our products deliver to the marketplace  and expect to see the full benefits of the price increases in fiscal in addition  we have been and continue to take measures to keep our cost structure in line with revenue  including continuing to focus on productivity while maintaining and upgrading our capacity to gain market share when our markets recover 
we acquired glassec  a leading architectural glass fabricator in brazil  in november  establishing an architectural glass footprint in a developing and fast growing market where we can provide technical and operational excellence 
we have been successful in winning and profitably executing installation work in new metropolitan markets to offset declines in core markets 
we are focusing on renovation of window and curtainwall systems where all sectors are increasing their interest in upgrading their facades 
we have tightened our capital spending criteria  although we continue to have cash available  and will be spending during fiscal for strategic investments for both international and domestic initiatives to drive growth and improve productivity 
we expect to emerge from the current downturn poised to win market share from competitors who were not as well positioned or do not have funds available to weather the current down cycle 
lso segment 
our basic strategy in this segment is to convert the custom picture framing market from clear uncoated glass to value added glass that protects art from uv damage while minimizing reflection from the glass so that viewers see the art rather than the glass 
we estimate that over percent of the retail picture framing market has converted to value added glass  and although we are finding it more difficult to convert  the ultimate potential is significantly higher 
we offer a variety of products with varying levels of reflection control and promote the benefits to consumers with point of purchase displays and other promotional materials 
we also work to educate the fragmented custom picture framing market regarding the opportunity to improve the profitability of their framing business by selling value added glass 
over the past two years  we have been extending our strategy to the fine art market  which includes museums and private collections 
we also made capital investments to support the conversion to value added picture framing products as well as to grow the fine art market 
as part of that extension  we developed value added acrylic products in addition to glass 
acrylic is a preferred material in the fine art markets because the art can be much larger and weight is an important consideration 
in fiscal  we expanded our strategies to include other markets that can be served with anti reflective acrylic products 

table of contents in fiscal  we established an initiative to begin selling our products in europe  and in fiscal  we began executing against this initiative 
historically  we have had very little presence in europe 
we believe our products and distribution networks will enable us to grow at a faster pace in europe than in the united states 
results of operations net sales dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased percent during fiscal despite flat market conditions due to market share gains in the window and storefront businesses and improved architectural glass pricing 
the glassecviracon business that was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal accounted for percentage points of the increase in fiscal in addition  fiscal included weeks compared to the prior year week period  which had a percent impact on current year sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales decreased percent due to challenging commercial construction market conditions during fiscal this resulted in lower demand  driving lower volume across all architectural segment business lines  and lower pricing  largely in our architectural glass business 
glassecviracon contributed million of sales to our architectural segment in fiscal for the period subsequent to acquisition 
performance the relationship between various components of operations  as a percentage of net sales  is illustrated below for the past three fiscal years 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense other income expense  net earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit expense earnings loss from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net earnings loss effective income tax rate for continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit was up percentage points due to the higher architectural glass pricing and the margin impact from the revenue growth in the window and storefront businesses  partially offset by lower margin work in the installation business 
during fiscal  we incurred unusually high costs to resolve architectural glass product quality issues from a vendor supplied material  as well as other quality issues  which negatively impacted gross profit by approximately million  or percentage points 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased as a percent of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  while spending was up million 
approximately half of the increase in spending relates to the impact of the addition of the glassecviracon business 
transition costs related to our retiring ceo and hiring our new ceo  increased commissions as a result of increased sales  and increased promotional costs in our lso segment also contributed to the increase in spending 

table of contents in the current year  income tax expense on pre tax income was more than offset by tax benefits from credits and deductions on a low base of earnings and the impact of statute of limitation expirations for prior fiscal years 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit was down percentage points due to lower pricing  primarily in our architectural glass business  as well as lower project margins and the impact of low capacity utilization from lower volume in our architectural segment 
during fiscal  we incurred unusually high costs to resolve architectural glass product quality issues from a vendor supplied material  as well as other quality issues  which negatively impacted gross profit by approximately million  or percentage points 
our lso segment had favorable results for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the ongoing strong mix of value added picture framing product and positive operating performance  partially offsetting the items above 
sg a expenses increased as a percent of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  while spending decreased by million 
the decrease in spending relates to reduced accruals for incentive and long term executive compensation expenses  lower spending on discretionary items as we focused on cost management  and reduced salaries and employee related expenses as a result of headcount reductions 
the increase as a percent of sales was largely due to our inability to leverage expenses over a lower level of sales dollars 
fiscal earnings from discontinued operations of million reflect favorable resolution of an outstanding tax exposure related to a foreign operation discontinued in the resolution of this exposure provided non cash income from discontinued operations of million in the second quarter 
fiscal also included a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter for expected settlement of an exposure related to a foreign operation discontinued in this settlement was finalized in march  and we paid million in the first half of fiscal for final resolution of this matter 
the settlements of these two items represent the last significant remaining items with respect to our international curtainwall business 
fiscal income of million was due to the favorable resolution of an outstanding lease claim and a reduction in reserves related to the expiration of warranty periods 
segment analysis architectural products and services architectural in thousands net sales operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales increased million or percent from fiscal  compared to growth of approximately percent in our markets served  according to mcgraw hill data 
the addition of glassecviracon accounted for percentage points of the increase for the year 
volume growth and increased market share in our window and storefront businesses and improved architectural glass pricing contributed to the year on year improvement 
in addition  the extra week in fiscal had an impact of percent on current year sales 
for fiscal  the segment incurred an operating loss of million  with an operating margin of negative percent compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal  with a negative operating margin of percent 
the improvement was due to the improved architectural glass pricing and the impact of the increased revenue in our window and storefront businesses 
these items were partially offset by lower margin work in the installation business as this business was working off projects that were bid at lower margins 
in fiscal  we incurred costs to resolve architectural glass product quality issues from a vendor supplied material  as well as other quality issues  which negatively impacted segment gross profit by approximately million  or percentage points 
fiscal was also impacted by costs to implement architectural glass productivity improvements 
glassecviracon was minimally accretive to segment results in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales decreased million or percent from fiscal  a decline that was in line with the percent decline in our markets served  according to mcgraw hill data 
we continued to be impacted by difficult us commercial construction market conditions during fiscal  with low employment levels and high vacancy rates for commercial buildings 
volume and pricing decreased across all of our architectural businesses  with our architectural glass business significantly impacted by lower pricing 
glassecviracon contributed million of sales to our architectural segment in fiscal for the period subsequent to acquisition 
for fiscal  the segment incurred an operating loss of million  with an operating margin of negative percent compared to operating income of million in fiscal  with an operating margin of percent 
the decrease in operating margin was due to lower pricing in our architectural glass business  lower project margins  the impact of low 
table of contents capacity utilization from lower volume  expenses related to architectural glass quality issues and costs to implement architectural glass productivity improvements 
during fiscal  we incurred costs to resolve architectural glass product quality issues from a vendor supplied material  as well as other quality issues  which negatively impacted gross profit by approximately million  or percentage points 
glassecviracon s contribution to the operating loss was minimal

the extra week in fiscal had an impact of percent on current year sales 
lso segment operating income as a percent of sales decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal and operating income was down million 
although we maintained a strong mix of value added picture framing product sales in fiscal  margins were negatively impacted by spending on sales  marketing and new market development initiatives  including international expansion 
fiscal compared to fiscal lso revenues increased million  or percent  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal on volume growth of percent 
lso segment operating income as a percent of sales improved to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal with a million increase in operating income 
throughout fiscal  we continued to see new and ongoing value added product customers convert to our best picture framing products 
operating income benefited from increased volume  a stronger mix of value added products and improved productivity 
fiscal results included the write off of certain production equipment which negatively impacted fiscal margins by percentage points 
consolidated backlog at march   our consolidated backlog was million  up percent over the million reported at february  the backlog of the architectural segment represented more than percent of consolidated backlog 
we expect percent of our total march  backlog to be recognized in fiscal revenue  compared to percent of the february  backlog that was expected to be produced and shipped in fiscal we view backlog as an important statistic in evaluating the level of sales activity and short term sales trends in our business 
however  as backlog is only one indicator  and is not an effective indicator of our ultimate profitability  we do not believe that backlog should be used as the sole indicator of future earnings of the company 
acquisitions on november   we acquired percent of the stock of glassec vidros de seguran a ltda  a privately held business  for million  net of cash acquired of million 
glassec is a leading architectural glass fabricator in brazil 
the business operates under the name glassecviracon as part of the company s architectural glass business 
glassecviracon s fiscal year ends december and is reported in the consolidated financial statements within our architectural segment on a two month lag 
the purchase is part of our strategy to increase our architectural glass penetration in international markets 
goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was million and is not tax deductible 
identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were million and include customer relationships  trademarks  patents and non compete agreements with a weighted average useful life of years 
discontinued operations in several transactions in fiscal years through  we completed the sale of our large scale domestic curtainwall business  the sale of our detention security business and the exit from international curtainwall operations 
the remaining estimated cash expenditures related to these discontinued operations are recorded as liabilities of discontinued operations and cover warranty issues relating to domestic and international construction projects that we expect to be resolved over the next five years 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  settlement of an outstanding legal claim related to a foreign discontinued operation resulted in a million increase in reserves and a pre tax loss from discontinued operations  which was finalized and paid in march in the second quarter of fiscal  the favorable resolution of an outstanding tax exposure related to a foreign operation discontinued in resulted in the release of million of uncertain tax positions and non cash income from discontinued operations 
the settlements of these two items represent the last significant remaining items with respect to our international curtainwall business 
during fiscal  a favorable resolution of an outstanding lease claim and a reduction in reserves related to the expiration of warranty periods resulted in pre tax income from discontinued operations of million

cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  while cash used by operating activities was million in fiscal and cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal fiscal operating cash flows were positively impacted by the income reported for the year as compared to the prior year  and were impacted less by the seasonally high cash outflow from operations in the first half of the year than in fiscal fiscal operating cash flows were negatively impacted by the loss from operations and seasonally high cash outflow from operations in the first half of the year as a result of payments made to fund annual incentive compensation  retirement plan contributions and annual insurance premiums 
the cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was the result of higher earnings 
non cash working capital current assets  excluding cash  short term marketable securities available for sale and short term restricted investments  less current liabilities was million at march  or percent of fiscal sales 
this compares to million at february  or percent of fiscal sales and million at february  or percent of fiscal sales 
the dollar change compared to fiscal was due to cash outflows for current and future growth 
we expect non cash working capital as a percent of sales to increase during fiscal as we anticipate that our architectural businesses will require more working capital to support increasing business activities 
investing activities 
investing activities provided net cash of million in fiscal  and used cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the current year included million in proceeds from the sale and leaseback of equipment 
net proceeds of million from restricted investments impacted the current year as some of the letters of credit that were being held outside of our credit facility were moved under the facility  releasing the money market funds we had been required to maintain to cover those exposures 
the net position of our investments resulted in million in net sales proceeds in fiscal  as we sold investments to fund current operating activities 
new capital investments were million for fiscal  primarily for safety and maintenance projects  and productivity improvements 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we invested in corporate owned life insurance policies of million with the intention of utilizing them as a long term funding source for our deferred compensation plan obligations 
the prior year period included million for the acquisition of the glassecviracon business 
prior year investing activities also included net purchases of restricted investments of million related to the funds received as a result of the recovery zone facility bonds that were made available for future investment in our architectural glass fabrication facility in utah 
the net position of our investments resulted in million in net sales proceeds on marketable securities as we converted those investments to cash equivalents to support higher working capital 
new capital investments for fiscal were million  primarily for safety and maintenance projects 
fiscal investing activities included million of net purchases of investments as we invested in liquid securities at that time to be used during the market downturn and for strategic investment 
fiscal capital expenditures were million  focused on safety and maintenance projects  as well as quick payback productivity improvements 
we anticipate that our fiscal capital expenditures will be approximately million for investments in new products  capacity  productivity improvements and international  as well as for maintenance requirements 
we continue to review our portfolio of businesses and their assets in comparison to our internal strategic and performance objectives 
as part of this review  we may acquire other businesses  further invest in  fully divest and or sell parts of our current businesses 

table of contents at march   we had two sale and leaseback agreements  one for a building that provides an option to purchase the building at projected future fair market value upon expiration of the lease in and one for equipment that provides an option to purchase the equipment at projected future fair market value upon expiration of the lease in the leases are classified as operating leases 
we had a deferred gain of million under the sale and leaseback transactions  which is included in the balance sheet as accrued expenses and other long term liabilities 
the average annual lease payments over the life of the remaining leases are million 
financing activities 
total outstanding borrowings at march  were million  compared to million at february  and million at february  long term debt consists of million of recovery zone facility bonds  million of industrial development bonds and other debt incurred by glassecviracon 
our debt to total capital ratio was percent at march   compared to percent at february  we maintain an million revolving credit facility  which expires in january  with borrowings secured by a pledge of certain assets of the company 
no borrowings were outstanding as of march  or february  the credit facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth as defined in the credit facility based on certain quarterly financial calculations 
the minimum required net worth computed in accordance with the credit agreement at march  was million  whereas our net worth as defined in the credit facility was million 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain an adjusted debt to ebitda ratio of not more than 
this ratio is computed quarterly  with ebitda computed on a rolling four quarter basis 
for purposes of calculating the adjusted debt in the debt to ebitda ratio  we reduce non credit facility debt for up to million to the extent of unrestricted cash balances  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities available for sale in excess of million 
our ratio was at march  if we are not in compliance with either of these covenants  the lenders may terminate the commitment and or declare any loan then outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
at march   we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit facility 
we assumed debt of million as part of the glassec acquisition  of which million was outstanding at march  and million of which was recorded as current maturities of long term debt 
the acquired debt matures in fiscal years through and has a weighted average interest rate of percent 
during fiscal  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of  shares of common stock 
the board of directors increased this authorization by  shares in january and by  shares in october we purchased  shares under the program during fiscal there were no share repurchases in fiscal we have purchased a total of  shares  at a total cost of million  since the inception of this program 
we have remaining authority to repurchase  shares under this program  which has no expiration date 
in addition to the shares repurchased under the repurchase plan  we also reacquired million and million of company stock from employees in order to satisfy stock for stock option exercises or withholding tax obligations related to stock based compensation  pursuant to terms of board and shareholder approved compensation plans during fiscal and  respectively 
other financing activities 
the following summarizes significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity future cash payments due by period in thousands thereafter total industrial revenue bonds recovery zone facility bonds other debt obligations operating leases undiscounted purchase obligations other obligations total cash obligations from time to time  we acquire the use of certain assets  such as warehouses  automobiles  forklifts  vehicles  office equipment  hardware  software and some manufacturing equipment through operating leases 
many of these operating leases have termination penalties 
however  because the assets are used in the conduct of our business operations  it is unlikely that any significant portion of these operating leases would be terminated prior to the normal expiration of their lease terms 
therefore  we consider the risk related to termination penalties to be minimal 
as of march   we have purchase obligations totaling million  the majority of which are for raw material commitments 

table of contents the other obligations in the table above relate to non compete and consulting agreements with current and former employees 
we expect to make contributions of million to our defined benefit pension plans in fiscal  which will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements 
as of march   we had million and million of unrecognized tax benefits and environmental liabilities  respectively 
we expect million of the unrecognized tax benefits to lapse in fiscal we are unable to reasonably estimate in which future periods the remaining unrecognized tax benefits and environmental liabilities will ultimately be settled 
at march   we had ongoing letters of credit related to construction contracts and certain industrial development bonds 
the company s million of industrial revenue bonds are supported by million of letters of credit that reduce availability of funds under our million credit facility 
the million of recovery zone facility bonds are supported by million of letters of credit 
the letters of credit by expiration period were as follows at march  amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands thereafter total standby letters of credit in addition to the above standby letters of credit  which were predominantly issued for our industrial development bonds  we are required  in the ordinary course of business  to obtain surety or performance bonds that commit payments to our customers for any non performance by us 
at march   million of our backlog was bonded by performance bonds with a face value of million 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  as we are released from the bonds upon completion of the contract 
we have never been required to pay on these performance based bonds with respect to any of our current portfolio of businesses 
we self insure our third party product liability coverages 
as a result  a material construction project rework event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we believe that current cash on hand and available capacity under our committed revolving credit facility  as well as the expected cash to be generated from future operating activities will be adequate to fund our working capital requirements  planned capital expenditures and dividend payments 
we had total cash and short term marketable securities available for sale of million at march  and million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that this will provide us with the financial strength to work through the ongoing weak market conditions and to continue our growth strategy through the recovery 
off balance sheet arrangements 
with the exception of operating leases  we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements at march  or february  outlook the following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
overall revenues for the year are expected to grow by mid single digits over fiscal we anticipate earnings per share of to 
capital expenditures are projected to be approximately million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see new accounting standards set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future  which is incorporated by reference herein 
critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements and related notes  and believes those policies and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies and estimates applied in the presentation of our financial statements relate to accounting for future events 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  management is required to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to our business and in the understanding of our results of operations and financial position 
table of contents revenue recognition our standard product sales terms are free on board fob shipping point or fob destination  and revenue is recognized when title has transferred 
however  our installation business records revenue on a percentage of completion basis as it relates to revenues earned from construction contracts 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our consolidated sales and percent of our architectural segment sales were recorded on a percentage of completion basis 
under this methodology  we compare the total costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs for the contract  and record that proportion of the total contract revenue in the period 
contract costs include materials  labor and other direct costs related to contract performance 
provisions are established for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in contract revenue only when customers have approved them 
a significant number of estimates are used in these computations 
goodwill impairment to determine if there has been any impairment in accordance with accounting standards  we evaluate the goodwill on our balance sheet annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist through a two step process 
in step one  we value each of our reporting units and compare these values to the reporting units net book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  we perform step two  which determines the amount of goodwill to impair 
we were not required to perform step two for fiscal although we consider public information for transactions made on similar businesses to ours  since there were no market comparables identified  we base our determination of fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant judgments based upon projections of future performance 
in developing our discounted cash flow analysis  assumptions about future revenues and expenses  capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and long term business plan for each of our reporting units 
these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience  anticipated future economic conditions and growth expectations for the industries and end markets in which we participate 
these assumptions are determined over a five year  long term planning period 
the five year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated 
revenues and operating profit beyond the five year period are projected to grow at a nominal perpetual growth rate for all reporting units 
the discount rate calculations are determined by assuming a company beta  market premium risk  size premium  the cost of debt and debt to capital ratio of a market participant 
the amount by which the estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded their book value utilizing the discounted cash flow methodology was more than percent at march  a significant change in the factors noted above could cause us to reduce the estimated fair value of some or all of our reporting units and recognize a corresponding impairment of our goodwill in connection with a future goodwill impairment test 
there can be no assurances that these forecasts will be attained 
adverse changes in strategy  market conditions or assumed market capitalization may result in an impairment of goodwill 
reserves for disputes and claims regarding product liability and warranties from time to time  we are subject to claims associated with our products and services  principally as a result of disputes with our customers involving the performance or aesthetics of our architectural products 
the time period from when a claim is asserted to when it is resolved  either by dismissal  negotiation  settlement or litigation  can be several years 
while we maintain product liability insurance  the insurance policies include significant self retention of risk in the form of policy deductibles 
in addition  certain claims could be determined to be uninsured 
we reserve based on our estimates of known claims  as well as on anticipated claims for possible product warranty and rework costs based on historical product liability claims as a ratio of sales 
self insurance reserves we obtain substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential losses for general liability  workers compensation  automobile liability  employment practices  architect s and engineer s errors and omissions risk  and other miscellaneous coverages 
however  an amount of risk is retained on a self insured basis through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
reserve requirements are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 

table of contents as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our management with responsibility for financial reporting  product and project management  quality  legal  tax and outside advisors such as consultants  engineers  lawyers and actuaries 
the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base its judgments on these future events and develop the estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements related to these events are based on the best estimates and judgments of apogee management 
however  outcomes could differ from our estimates and could materially adversely affect our future operating results  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio consists of municipal bonds 
at march   we had total investments of million  which are considered available for sale securities 
although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer and or letter of credit issuer  we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
accordingly  a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our municipal bond portfolio 
to manage our direct risk from changes in market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of our balance sheet  primarily debt obligations and fixed income securities  as well as market interest rates  to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and cash flow 
the primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under different interest rate environments 
the approach used to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis 
this approach calculates the impact on net earnings  relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing gradually over the next months by basis points 
this change in interest rates affecting our financial instruments at march  would result in an approximately million impact to net earnings 
the company s investments exceeded its debt at march   so as interest rates increase  net earnings increase  as interest rates decrease  net earnings decrease 
in addition to the market risk related to interest rate changes  the commercial construction markets in which our businesses operate are highly affected by changes in interest rates and  therefore  significant interest rate fluctuations could materially impact our operating results 
through our acquisition of glassec in fiscal  we conduct business in a location outside of the united states  and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency  the us dollar 
we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
the functional currency of glassecviracon is the local currency in the country of domicile  the brazilian real 
we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues  costs  assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies  thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange 
however  our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between brazilian real and the us dollar 
our domestic businesses generally sell within the united states  with sales made outside of the united states generally denominated in us dollars
