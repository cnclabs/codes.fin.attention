additionally  the financial accounting standards board has proposed various rule changes including  but not limited to  accounting for leases 
the sec is also currently considering adopting rules that would require us issuers to prepare their financial statements contained in sec filings in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs  as issued by the international accounting standards board 
the implementation of these or other new accounting requirements or other changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents litigation 
we are subject to various litigation matters  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals  either individually or through class actions  or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings 
these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties  including suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 
automotive manufacturers 
adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
manufacturer recalls could also adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of a recalled vehicle  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  sales and results of operations 
weather 
the occurrence of severe weather events  such as rain  snow  wind  storms  hurricanes or other natural disasters  could cause store closures  adversely affecting consumer traffic  and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period 
seasonal fluctuations 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters 
if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters  these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on our annual results of operations 
geographic concentration 
our performance is subject to local economic  competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate 
since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us  including florida  and in texas  southern california and washington  dc baltimore  our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets 
in the event that any of these geographic areas experienced a downturn in economic conditions  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  sales and results of operations 
other material events 
the occurrence of certain material events including acts of terrorism  the outbreak of war or other significant national or international events could have a material adverse effect on our business  sales  results of operations or financial condition

item properties 
we conduct our used vehicle operations in two basic retail formats production and non production superstores 
production superstores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed 
in determining whether to construct a production or a non production superstore on a given site  we take several factors into account  including the anticipated long term regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market 
as a result  some superstores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as non production superstores until we expand our presence in that market 
as of february   we operated production superstores and non production superstores 
at that date  we also operated one new car store  which was located adjacent to our used car superstore in laurel  maryland 
our remaining three new car franchises are operated as part of our used car superstores 
production superstores are generally  to  square feet on to acres  but a few range from  to  square feet on to acres 
non production superstores are generally  to  square feet on to acres

we also owned our home office building in richmond  virginia  and land associated with planned future store openings 

table of contents expansion since opening our first used car superstore in  we have grown organically  through the construction and opening of company operated stores 
we do not franchise our operations 
as of february   we operated used car superstores in us markets  which represented approximately of the us population 
we believe that further geographic expansion and additional fill in opportunities in existing markets will provide a foundation for future sales and earnings growth 
in december  we temporarily suspended store growth due to the weak economic and sales environment 
we resumed store growth in fiscal  opening three superstores that year and five superstores in fiscal we plan to open superstores in fiscal and between and superstores in each of the following fiscal years

subsequently  two other lawsuits  leena areso et al 
v 
carmax auto superstores california  llc and justin weaver v 
carmax auto superstores california  llc  were consolidated as part of the fowler case 
the allegations in the consolidated case involved failure to provide meal and rest breaks or compensation in lieu thereof  failure to pay wages of terminated or resigned employees related to meal and rest breaks and overtime  failure to pay overtime  failure to comply with itemized employee wage statement provisions  unfair competition  and california s labor code private attorney general act 
the putative class consisted of sales consultants  sales managers  and other hourly employees who worked for the company in california from april   to the present 
on may   the court dismissed all of the class claims with respect to the sales manager putative class 
on june   the court dismissed all claims related to the failure to comply with the itemized employee wage statement provisions 
the court also granted carmax s motion for summary adjudication with regard to carmax s alleged failure to pay overtime to the sales consultant putative class 
the plaintiffs appealed the court s ruling regarding the sales consultant overtime claim 
on may   the california court of appeal affirmed the ruling in favor of carmax 
the plaintiffs filed a petition of review with the california supreme court  which was denied 
as a result  the plaintiffs overtime claims are no longer a part of the lawsuit 
the claims currently remaining in the lawsuit regarding the sales consultant putative class are failure to provide meal and rest breaks or compensation in lieu thereof  failure to pay wages of terminated or resigned employees related to meal and rest breaks  unfair competition  and california s labor code private attorney general act 
on june   the court entered a stay of these claims pending the outcome of a california supreme court case involving unrelated third parties but related legal issues 
subsequently  carmax moved to lift the stay and compel the plaintiffs remaining claims into arbitration on an individual basis  which the court granted on november  the plaintiffs appealed the court s ruling to the california court of appeal 
the appeal is pending 
the fowler lawsuit seeks compensatory and special damages  wages  interest  civil and statutory penalties  restitution  injunctive relief and the recovery of attorneys fees 
we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these matters 
we are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
based upon our evaluation of information currently available  we believe that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect  either individually or in the aggregate  on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
