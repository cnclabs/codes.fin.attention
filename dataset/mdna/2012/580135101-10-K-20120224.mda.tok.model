item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company franchises and operates mcdonald s restaurants 
of the  restaurants in countries at year end   were franchised or licensed including  franchised to conventional franchisees   licensed to developmental licensees and  licensed to foreign affiliates affiliates primarily japan and  were operated by the company 
under our conventional franchise arrangement  franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment  signs  seating and d cor of their restaurant business  and by reinvesting in the business over time 
the company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both company operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites 
this maintains long term occupancy rights  helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees 
in certain circumstances  the company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants 
under our developmental license arrangement  licensees provide capital for the entire business  including the real estate interest  and the company has no capital invested 
in addition  the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate and or franchise restaurants within a market 
we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great  locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability 
however  directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience 
in our company operated restaurants  and in collaboration with franchisees  we further develop and refine operating standards  marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies  so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants 
we continually review  and as appropriate adjust  our mix of company operated and franchised conventional franchised  developmental licensed and foreign affiliated restaurants to help optimize overall performance 
the company s revenues consist of sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees 
revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments  and initial fees 
revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales  and generally include initial fees 
fees vary by type of site  amount of company investment  if any  and local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise license agreements that generally have year terms 
the business is managed as distinct geographic segments 
significant reportable segments include the united states us  europe  and asia pacific  middle east and africa apmea 
in addition  throughout this report we present other countries corporate that includes operations in canada and latin america  as well as corporate activities 
the us  europe and apmea segments account for  and of total revenues  respectively 
the united kingdom uk  france and germany  collectively  account for over of europe s revenues  and china  australia and japan a owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method  collectively  account for over of apmea s revenues 
these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately of total revenues 
in analyzing business trends  management considers a variety of performance and financial measures  including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth  systemwide sales growth and returns 
constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the company s underlying business trends 
comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the company s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends 
increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions  respectively  from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants  whether operated by the company or franchisees  in operation at least thirteen months  including those temporarily closed 
some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling  rebuilding  road construction and natural disasters 
comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation 
growth in comparable sales is driven by guest counts and average check  which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix 
generally  the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check 
mcdonald s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month  quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days 
the number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts 
the company refers to these impacts as calendar shift trading day adjustments 
in addition  the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts 
these impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal 
systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants 
while franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company  management believes the information is important in understanding the company s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base 
return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization numerator by the adjusted cash used for investing activities mcdonald s corporation annual report 
table of contents denominator  primarily capital expenditures 
the calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation 
strategic direction and financial performance the strength of the alignment between the company  its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald s success 
this business model enables mcdonald s to consistently deliver locally relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve 
in addition  it facilitates our ability to identify  implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers changing needs and preferences 
mcdonald s customer focused plan to win which concentrates on being better  not just bigger provides a common framework for our global business while allowing for local adaptation 
through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five elements of our plan to win people  products  place  price and promotion we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown comparable sales and customer visits in each of the last eight years 
this plan  combined with financial discipline  has delivered strong results for our shareholders 
we have exceeded our long term  constant currency financial targets of average annual systemwide sales growth of to  average annual operating income growth of to  and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the plan s implementation in  after adjusting for the loss in from the latin america developmental license transaction 
given the size and scope of our global business  we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable over time  keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long term benefit of our system 
in  we remained focused on customers needs and accelerated efforts within the plan to win where the greatest opportunity exists 
the company s key global priorities of optimizing our menu  modernizing the customer experience  and broadening accessibility to our brand represent areas where we are intensifying our efforts to drive the business further 
initiatives supporting these priorities resonated with consumers  driving increases in sales and customer visits despite challenging economies and a contracting informal eating out ieo segment in many markets 
as a result  every area of the world contributed to global comparable sales and guest counts increasing and  respectively 
specific menu pricing actions across our system reflect local market conditions as well as other factors  notably the food away from home and food at home inflation indices 
in our company operated restaurants  we manage menu board prices to ensure value at all price points  increase profitability and mitigate inflation  all while trying to maintain guest count momentum 
in order to accomplish these objectives  we utilize a strategic pricing tool that balances price  product mix and promotion 
franchisees also have access to  and many utilize  this strategic pricing tool 
in general  we believe franchisees employ a similar pricing strategy 
in  we increased average price at company operated restaurants in each area of the world  although increases varied by market and region 
we look to optimize product mix by utilizing a menu with entry point value  core  premium and fourth tier offerings 
we also introduce new products that meet customer needs  which can expand average check and increase guest counts 
in the us  we grew sales  guest counts and market share with comparable sales up for the ninth consecutive year  rising in  while comparable guest counts rose 
these results were achieved despite a slight decline in the ieo segment 
we remained focused on maximizing our core business while providing customers with affordable products and value throughout our menu including options available on the dollar menu at breakfast and the rest of the day 
we highlighted core menu items like chicken mcnuggets that featured new sauces  breakfast products including our new fruit maple oatmeal  additions to the mccaf beverage line and limited time offerings such as the mcrib sandwich 
the national launch of the mccaf frozen strawberry lemonade and mango pineapple real fruit smoothie provided meaningful extensions to the mccaf beverage line 
convenient locations also continued to provide a competitive advantage with extended hours and efficient drive thru service 
modernizing the customer experience remained a focus with the expansion of our major remodeling program to enhance the appearance and functionality of our restaurants and make our restaurants more relevant to our customers daily lives 
over existing restaurants were remodeled during with the majority adding drive thru capacity to capture additional guest counts 
we also completed our two year  systemwide roll out of a new point of sale system 
this allows us to continue expanding our menu offerings while making it easier for our crew to fulfill every order accurately 
in europe  comparable sales rose  marking the eighth consecutive year of comparable sales increases  and comparable guest counts rose 
major contributors were the uk  france  russia and germany 
initiatives that helped drive our business included leveraging our tiered menu featuring everyday affordable prices  menu variety including new and limited time offerings  and reimaging over restaurants 
we continue to expand our coffee business and have over  mccaf locations  which in europe are generally separate areas inside the restaurants that serve specialty coffees  indulgent desserts and snacks 
we completed the rollout of the new drive thru customer order display system in over  restaurants 
in addition  we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended operating hours 
we offered new premium menu items such as the burger and expanded mcwraps across several european markets 
in many markets  we have continued to offer a fourth tier platform such as little tasters in the uk a range of tasty and appealing items in smaller portion sizes 
finally  we continued building customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of mcdonald s food and our commitment to sustainable business practices 
in apmea  our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales  led by china and australia 
comparable sales rose and comparable guest counts rose with performance driven by strategies emphasizing value  breakfast  convenience  core menu extensions  desserts and promotional food events 
australia launched a value lunch program that features meals at discounted price points for certain hours while china and japan concentrated on affordability by continuing their value lunch platforms 
new menu items such as real fruit smoothies and frapp s in australia and the extension of the value breakfast program in china were popular with customers 
japan executed another successful us themed burger promotion and celebrated its th anniversary by offering popular core menu items at reduced prices 
desserts mcdonald s corporation annual report 
table of contents continue to play a meaningful role as we seek to deliver on customers menu expectations through products such as the mcflurry and unique delivery storefronts like the dessert kiosks in china  where we are now one of the largest ice cream retailers 
our breakfast business continues to evolve and is now offered in approximately of apmea restaurants 
in japan  rotational breakfast items  including the chicken muffin and tuna muffin  were offered during several months  while australia launched new breakfast menu items such as bagel sandwiches 
nearly two thirds of apmea restaurants are now offering some form of extended operating hours and over  restaurants are open hours 
delivery is offered in many apmea markets and is now available in over  restaurants  including nearly in china 
mcdonald s japan was negatively impacted by the natural disaster last march and as a result  continued to face some challenges throughout however  we remain confident that the market will continue to drive long term profitable growth 
our approach to offering affordable value to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant level food and paper costs by leveraging our scale  supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices 
our ability to execute our strategies in every area of the world  grow comparable sales and control selling  general administrative expenses resulted in combined operating margin operating income as a percent of total revenues of in  an improvement of percentage points over in  strong global sales and margin performance grew cash from operations  which rose million to billion 
our substantial cash flow  strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us flexibility to fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders 
capital expenditures of approximately billion were invested in our business primarily to open new restaurants and reimage existing restaurants 
across the system   restaurants were opened and over  existing locations were reimaged 
in addition  we returned billion to shareholders consisting of billion in share repurchases and billion in dividends 
cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner operators is a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs 
in addition  the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the company owned model 
we believe locally owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantages  making mcdonald s not just a global brand but also a locally relevant one 
highlights from the year included comparable sales grew and guest counts rose  building on increases of and  respectively 
revenues increased in constant currencies 
operating income increased in constant currencies

opportunities around additional staffing at peak hours during the breakfast and lunch day parts and increasing restaurants that operate hours per day will allow us to broaden accessibility to our customers 
in addition  our plans to elevate the brand experience include leveraging our new point of sale system with other technology enhancements such as using hand held order takers and advancements to improve our front counter service system 
we also will expand our major remodel program to another locations in our business plans in europe are focused on building market share with the right mix of guest counts  average check  strategic restaurant reimaging and expansion 
we will increase our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with a variety of promotional food events as well as new snack and dessert options

in addition  the uk will be the proud host of our olympic sponsorship  marking the ninth consecutive time that mcdonald s will serve as the official restaurant of the olympic games 
in  our european business will continue to face headwinds due to economic uncertainty and additional government initiated austerity measures implemented in many countries 
while we will closely monitor consumer reactions to these measures  we remain confident that our business model will continue to drive profitable growth 
in apmea  we will continue our efforts to become our customers first choice for eating out by continuing to provide robust value platforms and focusing on menu variety  restaurant experience and convenience 
value will continue to be a key growth driver as we reinforce the affordability of our menu to consumers across all dayparts  by building on our successful value lunch platforms and expanding our breakfast offerings

mcdonald s does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share 
the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company s results changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion 
the company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately percentage points to systemwide sales growth in constant currencies  most of which will be due to about net traditional restaurants added in the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales 
however  as a perspective  assuming no change in cost structure  a percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the us or europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about cents 
with about of mcdonald s grocery bill comprised of different commodities  a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the company s commodity costs 
for the full year  the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase in the us and in europe  with more pressure expected in the first half 
the company expects full year selling  general administrative expenses to increase about in constant currencies  driven by certain technology investments  primarily to accelerate future restaurant capabilities  and costs related to the worldwide owner operator convention and olympics

based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates  the company expects interest expense for the full year to increase approximately compared with a significant part of the company s operating income is generated outside the us  and about of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the euro  british pound  australian dollar and canadian dollar

supplemental information regarding company operated restaurants we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance  profits and returns 
in most cases  franchising is the best way to achieve these goals  but as previously stated  company operated restaurants are also important to our success 
we report results for company operated restaurants based on their sales  less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs 
we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues  less associated occupancy costs 
for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure  we do not specifically allocate selling  general administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to company operated or franchised restaurants 
other operating items that relate to the company operated restaurants generally include gains losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements 
we believe the following information about company operated restaurants in our most significant segments provides an additional perspective on this business 
management responsible for our company operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the company operated business on this basis to assess its performance 
management of the company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix  subject to other relevant considerations 
the following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our company operated margins 
the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations  which we refer to as store operating margin 
the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties 
we refer to this component as brand real estate margin 
both company operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties  although rent and royalties for company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation 
rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales  and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald s investment in the restaurant 
royalty rates may also vary by market 
as shown in the following table  in disaggregating the components of our company operated margins  certain costs with respect to company operated restaurants are reflected in brand real estate margin 
those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy other operating expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses  and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating brand real estate margin 
while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our company operated business  it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles mcdonald s corporation annual report 
table of contents generally accepted in the us in particular  as noted previously  we do not allocate selling  general administrative expenses to our company operated business 
however  we believe that about  per restaurant  on average  is the typical cost to support this business in the us the actual costs in markets outside the us will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market 
these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant

this adjustment is made to reflect expense in store operating margin and income in brand real estate margin 
countries within europe have varying economic profiles and a wide range of rent and royalty rates as a percentage of sales 
selling  general administrative expenses consolidated selling  general administrative expenses increased flat in constant currencies in and increased in constant currencies in the growth rate for was flat as higher employee and other costs were offset by lower incentive based compensation and costs in related to the vancouver olympics and the company s biennial worldwide owner operator convention

the company s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market 
resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business 
the company realized lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses in compared with primarily as a result of selling fewer company operated restaurants to franchisees

the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments  however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues  local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from levels nor a adverse change in foreign currency rates from levels would materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments

other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 
the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with mcdonald s corporation annual report 
table of contents similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment  or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods 
share based compensation the company has a share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors 
the expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions  which impact the assumed fair value  including the expected life of the stock option  the risk free interest rate  expected volatility of the company s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield 
the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 
long lived assets impairment review long lived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company s experience and knowledge of its operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales 
if the company s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
based on the annual goodwill impairment test  conducted in the fourth quarter  the company does not have any reporting units defined as each individual country with goodwill currently at risk of impairment 
litigation accruals in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors  customers  employees  franchisees  government agencies  intellectual property  shareholders and suppliers 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies  including the sale of appreciated assets  in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
in  the internal revenue service irs concluded its field examination of the company s us federal income tax returns for and in connection with this examination  the company received notices of proposed adjustments from the irs related to certain foreign tax credits of about million  excluding interest and potential penalties 
the company disagrees with the irs proposed adjustments 
the company has filed a protest with the irs appeals office and expects resolution on this issue in the company does not believe that the resolution will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows 
the company s and us federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the examination is expected in deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates 
the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management s intentions change in the future  deferred taxes may need to be provided 
effects of changing prices inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively 
this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover  the ability to adjust menu prices  cost controls and substantial property holdings  many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 
reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 
the numerator is the company s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period 
mcdonald s corporation annual report 
table of contents the denominator is the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period 
adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the pret a manger and redbox transactions 
the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis 
these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter s investing activities to incremental operating income 
for example  fourth quarter investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations 
in contrast  fourth quarter is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than months ago  and therefore have a full year impact on operating income  with little or no impact to the base period and of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations  respectively 
management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average 
the reconciliations to the most comparable measurements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  for the numerator and denominator of the one year and three year roiic are as follows one year roiic calculation dollars in millions years ended december  incremental change numerator operating income depreciation and amortization currency translation incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization at constant foreign exchange rates denominator weighted average cash used for investing activities currency translation weighted average cash used for investing activities at constant foreign exchange rates one year roiic represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured
