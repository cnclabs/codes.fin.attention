table of contents use of constant currency revenue from our international operations has historically been a significant portion of our total revenue 
as a result  our revenue results have been impacted  and we expect will continue to be impacted  by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons  we believe the presentation of revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis helps improve the ability to understand our revenue results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods 
the constant currency information presented is calculated by translating current period results using prior year weighted average foreign currency exchange rates 
these results should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
overview we are a global enterprise software company that enables organizations to achieve higher levels of business performance by improving operational responsiveness 
operational responsiveness is the ability of business processes and systems to respond to changing business conditions and customer interactions as they occur 
we offer a portfolio of best in class  real time software solutions providing enterprises with significantly improved operational responsiveness within all events and activities that they participate 
we have three segments application development platforms  enterprise business solutions and enterprise data solutions 
however  our organization is managed primarily on a functional basis 
we assign dedicated costs and expenses  primarily costs of revenue and product development  directly to each segment and utilize an allocation methodology to assign all other costs and expenses  primarily sales and marketing and general and administrative  to each segment 
a significant portion of the total costs and expenses assigned to each segment are allocated 
during fiscal  we continued to invest significantly in the progress rpm suite  which is the integration of products within our enterprise business solutions segment  and is designed to enable businesses to gain visibility into critical processes  immediately respond to events and continuously improve business performance through the progress control tower  a unified interactive environment 
we believe the progress rpm suite will enhance our competitiveness within our markets and our long term growth prospects and we achieved significant growth in sales of these products during fiscal however  the introduction and integration of the progress rpm suite has resulted in increased costs and we cannot predict whether these new products will gain market acceptance and generate sufficient revenues to justify their costs 
during the past year  we made significant investments and changes in our global field organization  particularly within our direct field professional services and marketing organizations  designed to enhance our solution selling capabilities and enable us to complete an increasing number of larger transactions 
however  we have not yet fully realized the benefits of these investments and changes  and this has negatively impacted our results 
we expect these investments and changes to continue in fiscal our dependence on larger transactions as a result of our shift to an industry vertical and solutions focus has made us  and is expected to continue to make us  more susceptible to quarter to quarter revenue fluctuations 
this is because our revenue growth rates  particularly within our enterprise business solutions segment  are dependent on our ability to license to direct customers  which can lead to longer deal cycles and potential delays in purchasing decisions as a result of macroeconomic conditions 
the us and many foreign economies continue to experience uncertainty driven by varying macroeconomic conditions 
although some of these economies have shown signs of improvement  macroeconomic recovery remains uneven 
uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and associated global economic conditions have resulted in extreme volatility in credit  equity  and foreign currency markets  including the european sovereign debt markets and volatility in various markets including the financial services sector 
during fiscal  we were adversely impacted by these conditions as some customers delayed software investments in response to this macroeconomic uncertainty 
the continuation of this climate could cause our customers to further delay  forego or reduce the amount of their investments in our products or delay payments of amounts due to us 
we expect these macroeconomic conditions to continue in fiscal  most particularly  in europe  the middle east and africa emea 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations  which are primarily conducted in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar have significantly impacted and will continue to significantly impact our results of operations

to the extent that we complete any future acquisitions  our cash position could be reduced

liquidity and capital resources cash and short term investments at the end of fiscal  our cash and short term investments totaled million 
the decrease of million since the end of fiscal was primarily due to cash used for stock repurchases and the acquisition of corticon  partially offset by cash generated from operations and issuances of common stock upon exercise of stock options 
there are no limitations on our ability to access our cash and short term investments 
approximately million and million of our cash and short term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at november  and  respectively 
we do not intend to repatriate these funds  and as such  they are not available to fund our domestic operations 
if we were to repatriate the funds  they would be subject to taxation in the u 
s  but would primarily be offset by foreign tax credits 
we do not believe this has a material impact on our liquidity 
revolving credit facility on august   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement for an unsecured credit facility with jp morgan and other lenders that matures on august   at which time all amounts outstanding must be repaid 
the credit facility provides for a revolving line of credit in the amount of million  with a sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit in a face amount up to million and swing line loans up to million 
the credit facility also permits us to increase the revolving line of credit by up to an additional million subject to receiving further commitments from lenders and certain other conditions 
we intend to utilize the line of credit for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  stock repurchases and working capital 
revolving loans accrue interest at a per annum rate based on our choice of either i the libor rate plus a margin ranging from to or ii the base rate plus a margin ranging from to  both depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the base rate is defined as the highest of i the administrative agent s prime rate ii the federal funds rate plus of  and iii the libor rate for a one month interest period plus a margin equal to 
a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility is required  at a per annum rate ranging from to  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the loan origination fee and issuance costs incurred upon consummation of the credit agreement will be amortized through interest expense using the effective interest rate method  over the five year term of the facility 
other customary fees and letter of credit fees may be charged and will be expensed as they are incurred 
accrued interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to base rate loans and at the end of each interest rate period or at each three month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months with respect to libor rate loans 
we may prepay  terminate or reduce the loan commitments in whole or in part at any time  without premium or penalty  subject to certain conditions and reimbursement of certain costs in the case of libor rate loans 
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants 
we are also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio of no greater than to and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least to 
as of november   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving line and million of letters of credit 
we are in compliance with our covenants by a significant margin 
auction rate securities in addition to the million of cash and short term investments  we had investments with a fair value of million related to auction rate securities ars that are classified as long term investments 
these ars are floating rate securities with longer term maturities that were marketed by financial institutions with auction reset dates at primarily or day intervals 
table of contents to provide short term liquidity 
the remaining contractual maturities of these securities range from to years 
the underlying collateral of the ars consist of municipal bonds  which are insured by monoline insurance companies  and student loans  which are supported by the federal government as part of the federal family education loan program ffelp and by the monoline insurance companies 
beginning in february  auctions for these securities began to fail  and the interest rates for these ars reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering document 
at november   our ars investments classified as long term investments totaled million at par value 
during fiscal  noncurrent ars totaling million were redeemed at par by the issuers  resulting in a net reduction of the par value of our ars investments classified as long term investments to million 
these ars are classified as available for sale securities 
for each of the ars classified as available for sale  we evaluated the risks related to the structure  collateral and liquidity of the investment  and forecasted the probability of issuer default  auction failure and a successful auction at par or a redemption at par for each future auction period 
the weighted average cash flow for each period was then discounted back to present value for each security 
based on this methodology  we determined that the fair value of our non current ars investments is million at november   and we have recorded a temporary impairment charge in accumulated other comprehensive income of million to reduce the value of our available for sale ars investments 
we will not be able to access these remaining funds until a future auction for these ars is successful  we sell the securities in a secondary market  or they are redeemed by the issuer 
as such  these remaining investments currently lack short term liquidity and are therefore classified as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet at november  based on our cash and short term investments balance of million  expected operating cash flows and our revolving credit facility  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity associated with these ars to adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the affected securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period 
therefore  the impairment on these securities is considered only temporary in nature 
if the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments deteriorates significantly  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the ars through an impairment charge 
cash flows from operations we generated cash from operations of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the components of our cash flows from operations for fiscal years  and are as follows in thousands year ended november  net income depreciation  amortization and other noncash charges changes in operating assets and liabilities total our gross accounts receivable decreased by million from the end of fiscal days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable decreased year over year by day to days at the end of fiscal as compared to days at the end of fiscal  but increased from days at the end of fiscal we target a dso range of to days 
cash flows from investing and financing activities as described above  on august   we entered into a credit agreement for an unsecured credit facility with jp morgan and other lenders that matures on august   at which time all amounts outstanding must be repaid

as of november   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving line and million of letters of credit 
we purchased million of property and equipment in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the purchases in each fiscal year consisted primarily of computer equipment  software and building and leasehold improvements 
purchases in fiscal also include capital expenditures related to the upgrade of our order management system  which is not yet completed 
we financed these purchases primarily from cash generated from operations 

table of contents we purchased and retired  shares of our common stock for million in fiscal year   shares of our common stock for million in fiscal year  and  shares for million in fiscal year on october   our board of directors authorized  for the period from october  through september   the purchase of up to million of our common stock  at such times that management deems such purchases to be an effective use of cash 
on june   the board of directors increased and extended the program for an additional million through may  as of november  no amounts remain available for purchase under this program 
on october   we acquired all of the equity interests in corticon  a privately held business enterprise software company based in redwood city  california  for million 
corticon is a business rule management system vendor that enables organizations to make better  faster decisions by automating business rules 
the corticon products became part of our enterprise business solutions segment 
on january   we acquired savvion  inc  a privately held company  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
savvion is a provider of business process management software 
the savvion products became part of our enterprise business solutions segment 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases  and accordingly  the results of operations of corticon and savvion were included in our operating results from the date of acquisition 
we paid the purchase price for each acquisition in cash from available funds 
we had no acquisitions in fiscal year we expect to continue to pursue additional acquisitions during fiscal  although we can make no assurances that we will be able to identify and complete any acquisitions 
our acquisition strategy has been to expand our business and or add complimentary products and technologies to our existing product sets 
to the extent that we complete any future acquisitions  our cash position could be reduced 
indemnification obligations we include standard intellectual property indemnification provisions in our licensing agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to our product license agreements  we will indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party  generally business partners or customers  in connection with certain patent  copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by third parties with respect to our products 
other agreements with our customers provide indemnification for claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by us or our subcontractors 
historically  our costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been insignificant 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is immaterial 
liquidity outlook we believe that existing cash balances  together with funds generated from operations and amounts available under the credit agreement  will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements including planned capital expenditures  acquisitions  lease commitments  restructuring obligations  debt payments and other long term obligations through at least the next twelve months 
to the extent we complete any future acquisitions  our cash position could be reduced 
revenue backlog our aggregate revenue backlog at november  was approximately million  of which million was included on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue  primarily related to unexpired maintenance and support contracts 
at november   the remaining amount of backlog of approximately million was composed of multi year licensing arrangements of approximately million and open software license orders received but not shipped of approximately million 
our backlog of orders not included on the balance sheet is not subject to our normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements 
our aggregate revenue backlog at november  was approximately million  of which million was included on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue  primarily related to unexpired maintenance and support contracts 
at november   the remaining amount of backlog of approximately million was composed of multi year licensing arrangements of approximately million and open software license orders received but not shipped of approximately million 
we typically fulfill most of our software license orders within days of acceptance of a purchase order 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize software license revenue upon shipment of the product  or if delivered electronically  when the customer has the right to access the software 
because there are many elements governing when revenue is recognized  including when orders are shipped  credit approval obtained  completion of internal control processes over revenue recognition and other factors  management has some control in determining the period in which certain revenue is recognized 
we frequently have open software license orders at the end of a quarter which have not shipped or have 
table of contents otherwise not met all the required criteria for revenue recognition 
although the amount of open software license orders may vary at any time  we generally do not believe that the amount  if any  of such software license orders at the end of a particular quarter is a reliable indicator of future performance 
in addition  there is no industry standard for the definition of backlog and there may be an element of estimation in determining the amount 
as such  direct comparisons with other companies may be difficult or potentially misleading 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the following table details our contractual obligations as of november  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest payment on long term debt operating leases unrecognized tax benefits total this liability is not subject to fixed payment terms and the amount and timing of payments  if any  which we will make related to this liability are not known 
see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k for additional information 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from software licenses and maintenance and services 
our revenue arrangements generally contain multiple elements 
the primary judgments used in evaluating revenue recognized in each period involve determining whether collection is probable  assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  and determining the fair value of the maintenance and services elements included in multiple element software arrangements 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting results of operations 
in determining when to recognize revenue from a customer arrangement  we are often required to exercise judgment regarding the application of our accounting policies to a particular arrangement 
in making an assessment of collectability  we consider customer credit worthiness  a customer s historical payment experience  economic conditions in the customer s industry and geographic location and general economic conditions 
in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  we consider the payment terms of the transaction  including transactions that extend beyond our customary payment terms 
we generally use the residual method to recognize revenue from software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of maintenance and services is determined based on our recent pricing for those services when sold 
table of contents separately  or based on a substantive maintenance renewal clause within a customer contract 
we consider maintenance rates in excess of of license value to be substantive based on our analysis of the cost to provide post contract support 
substantially all license arrangements indicate the renewal rate for which customers may  at their option  renew their maintenance agreement 
we review services sold separately on a periodic basis and update  when appropriate  our vsoe of fair value for such maintenance and services to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
such judgments can materially impact the amount of revenue that we record in a given period 
while we follow specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition  we make and use significant management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period  particularly in the areas described above 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we establish this allowance using estimates that we make based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  changes to customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
historically  our actual losses have been consistent with the allowances recorded 
however  if we used different estimates  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we would require additional provisions for doubtful accounts that would increase bad debt expense 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment we have goodwill and net intangible assets of million at november  we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we assess our amortizing intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that the fair value of such assets was less than the carrying value 
when we evaluate potential impairments outside of our annual measurement date  judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  significant changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price or in the value of one of our reporting units for a sustained period of time 
we utilize either discounted cash flow models or other valuation models  such as comparative transactions and market multiples  to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
the determination of reporting units also requires management judgment 
we consider whether a reporting unit exists within a reportable segment based on the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by segment management 
we utilize undiscounted cash flows to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in those models 
different assumptions and judgment determinations could yield different conclusions that would result in an impairment charge to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
as of november   we are not at risk of failing step one of our goodwill impairment test 
the fair values of our reporting units are substantially in excess of their carrying values 
income tax accounting we have a net deferred tax asset of million at november  we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider scheduled reversals of temporary differences  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters in assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 
if we were to change our assumptions or otherwise determine that we were unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
management judgment is also required in evaluating whether a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  based on the weight of available evidence  indicates that it is more likely than not that  on an evaluation of the technical merits  the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
management judgment is also required in measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the amount accrued for uncertain tax positions would occur 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation based on the fair value of stock based awards measured at the date of grant 
stock based compensation is recognized over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the award  and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of each stock based award on the measurement date using either the current market price or the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to the expected stock price volatility  the expected term of the option  a risk free interest rate and a dividend yield 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price 
the expected term of options is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield of zero coupon us treasury securities for the period that is commensurate with the expected option term at the time of grant 
the expected dividend yield is based on our historical behavior and future expectations of dividend declarations 
many of these assumptions are highly subjective and require the exercise of management judgment 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the amount of stock based compensation may occur 
investments in debt securities we have approximately million at fair value par value of million in investments related to ars  all of which are classified as noncurrent at november  for each of our ars  we evaluate the risks related to the structure  collateral and liquidity of the investment  and forecast the probability of issuer default  auction failure and a successful auction at par  or a redemption at par  for each future auction period 
based on the results of this assessment  we record either a mark to market adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or an other than temporary impairment charge in other income in our consolidated statements of income 
if we use different assumptions or the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of our available for sale ars through an other than temporary impairment charge in current period earnings 
restructuring charges we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidations and or relocations of operations  changes to our strategic plan  or managerial responses to declines in demand  increasing costs  or other market factors 
the determination of restructuring charges requires management judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits  such as costs of severance and termination benefits  and estimates of costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
in determining the amount of the facilities charge  we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly based on known real estate market conditions and the credit worthiness of subtenants  and may result in revisions to established facility reserves 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible asset acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the estimates used to value the net assets acquired are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company 
we generally value the identifiable intangible assets acquired using a discounted cash flow model 
the significant estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows of the asset  discount rates to determine the present value of the future cash flows  attrition rates of customers  and expected technology life cycles 
we also estimate the useful lives of the intangible assets based on the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefit from the asset 
our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the fair values of the net assets acquired may result 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounts standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its 
table of contents carrying value 
if after performing the qualitative assessment an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
asu is effective for us in fiscal and earlier adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu is not anticipated to have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu  to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu asu  which defers the effective date of only those changes in asu that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
asu is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal and should be applied retrospectively 
the adoption of asu and asu is not anticipated to have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu  to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for us in our second quarter of fiscal and should be applied prospectively 
the adoption of asu is not anticipated to have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and have policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
our investments have an average remaining maturity of less than two years or interest rate resets of less than days and are primarily fixed rate instruments 
in addition  we have classified the majority of our debt securities as available for sale 
the available for sale classification reduces the consolidated statements of income exposure to interest rate risk if such investments are held until their maturity date because changes in fair value due to market changes in interest rates are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive instruments and cash flows are immaterial 
additionally  see further discussion regarding market risks with our investments in auction rate securities under liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k 
we generally use foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge economically a portion of forecasted international cash flows for up to one year in the future 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  british pound  brazilian real  japanese yen and australian dollar 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
all foreign currency option contracts are recorded at fair value in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period and expire within one year 
in fiscal  mark to market losses of million on foreign currency option contracts were recorded in other income in the consolidated statement of income 
we also use forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge economically the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies 
we generally do not hedge the net assets of our international subsidiaries 
all forward contracts are recorded at fair value in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period and expire within days 
in fiscal  realized and unrealized losses of million from our forward contracts were recognized in other income in the consolidated statement of income 
these losses were substantially offset by realized and unrealized gains on the offsetting positions 
foreign currency translation exposure from a movement of currency exchange rates would have a material impact on our reported revenue and net income 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in all foreign currency exchange rates  our revenue would be adversely affected by approximately and our net income would be adversely affected by approximately excluding any offsetting positive impact from our ongoing hedging programs  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
