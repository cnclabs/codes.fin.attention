item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified our accounting policies related to our calculation of the allowance for credit losses  valuation of other real estate owned oreo  impaired loans  and estimates relating to income taxes as policies that are most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results 
application of these policies and calculation of these amounts involve difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  and often involve estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies are discussed in greater detail below  as well as in note summary of significant accounting policies to the company s audited consolidated financial statements included under the section financial statements and supplementary data item of this report 
allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established to absorb known and inherent losses attributable to loans outstanding 
the adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an ongoing basis and is based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and nonperforming trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
as of december   approximately of premierwest s gross loan portfolio is secured by real estate 
accordingly  a significant decline in real estate values from current levels in oregon and california could cause management to increase the allowance for loan losses and or experience greater loan charge offs 
other real estate owned oreo 
oreo acquired through foreclosure or deeds in lieu of foreclosure  is carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated costs of disposal 
when property is acquired  any excess of the loan balance over the fair value is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
holding costs  subsequent write downs to fair value  if any  or any disposition gains or losses are included in non interest expense 
stock option plan 
the company measures and recognizes as compensation expense  the grant date fair market value for all share based awards 
the company estimates the fair market value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to value its stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  the expected dividend yield  the weighted average expected life of the options  and the historical volatility of its stock price 
income taxes 
the company establishes a deferred tax valuation allowance to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   the company continued to conclude it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would not be realized  and the valuation allowance reduced the deferred tax asset to zero 
the determination of our ability to fully utilize our deferred tax assets requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation of complex tax laws 
as such  we have written them down to the net realizable value 
prospectively  as the company continues to evaluate available evidence  including the depth of the current economic downturn and its implications on its operating results  it is possible that the company may deem some or all of its deferred income tax assets to be realizable 
core deposit intangibles 
in july  the company acquired two wachovia bank branches in northern california 
this acquisition included a core deposit intangible asset representing the value of the long term deposit relationships acquired and a negative cd premium as a result of the current all in cost of the cd portfolio being well above the cost of similar funding 
the core deposit intangible asset is being amortized over an estimated weighted average useful life of years 
the negative cd premium was fully amortized in

this settlement resulted in a charge off of million including a partial write down of a remaining non performing loan and a cash settlement in exchange for deeds in lieu of foreclosure and dismissal of lawsuits 
the impact on operations of this settlement was reflected in fourth quarter  whereas the company obtained possession of real property and other collateral on january  the lawsuits were dismissed on january  the table provided below displays selected asset quality ratios as of december   and those same ratios adjusted for the impact of this settlement  had the collateral and real property been obtained as of december  december  actual december  adjusted for settlement allowance for loan losses to gross loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans non performing loans to gross loans non performing assets to total assets 
table of contents on january   the company announced it will consolidate branches into existing nearby branches by the end of april five of the branches to be consolidated are located in oregon  and the other six branches are located in california 
the decision to consolidate these branches and the projected reduction in expenses followed an extensive branch network analysis with a focus on reducing expense  improving efficiency  and positively impacting the overall value of the company 
these branches represent less than of the total bank wide deposits 
asset quality at december   the company had million in adversely classified loans 
this compares favorably to million at december  adversely classified loans have declined for five consecutive quarters and were down from december  included in adversely classified loans at december   were non performing loans of million  compared to million  at december  non performing loans have declined for five consecutive quarters and were down from december  reductions in non performing loans occurred primarily in the commercial real estate loan category 
of those loans currently designated as non performing  approximately million  or are current as to payment of principal and interest 
the company monitors delinquencies  defined as loans on accruing status days past due  as an indicator of future non performing assets 
total delinquencies were million  or of gross loans  at december   a reduction from million  or  at december  for the year ended december   total net loan charge offs were million compared to million in the year ended december  the net charge offs in the current period were concentrated in the construction and land development and non owner occupied commercial real estate loan categories and were primarily associated with the master settlement with the bank s largest non performing loan relationship 
the ratio of net loan charge offs to average gross loans for the current year was compared to in the previous year 
average gross loans in the current period were lower than the previous year 
reductions in non performing loans were due to the company taking ownership of additional residential and commercial properties related to loans which previously were on nonaccrual status  nonaccrual loan payoffs  charge offs  and the return of loans to performing status 
the company s allowance for credit losses continues to decline in concert with the reduction in adversely classified loans  loan delinquencies and other relevant credit metrics 
with the reduction in net charge offs over the past several years and change in the loan portfolio composition  loss factors used in management s estimates to establish reserve levels have declined commensurately 
the provision for credit losses was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million in the same period last year 
the trend of future provision for credit losses will depend primarily on economic conditions  level of adversely classified assets  and changes in collateral values 
at december   total non performing assets were down compared to december  non performing assets and non performing loans have also declined compared to december   in terms of percentage of total assets and loans  respectively 
the amount of additions to non performing assets has slowed during versus the prior year 
this is due to the positive impact of business improvement plans implemented by a number of borrowers in response to the current economic downturn 
the company has remained focused on oreo property disposition activities 
while sales were down compared to the prior year  current period sales were higher than the same period last year 
the largest balances in the oreo portfolio at december   were attributable to residential and commercial site development 
table of contents projects  followed by income producing properties  all of which are located within the regions in which we operate 
the total number of oreo property units has decreased during the year 
this reduction is a result of sales that occurred during the year and fewer properties transferred to oreo during the period 
loans and deposits the bank s total loan portfolio declined from december   reflecting the continued challenges in the local and national economy 
loan totals have also declined because the company exited a number of higher risk rated loan relationships over the past year which contributed to the contraction in the commercial real estate loan category over the same period 
interest and fees earned on our loan portfolio are our primary source of revenue 
our ability to achieve loan growth will be dependent on many factors  including the effects of competition  economic conditions in our markets  retention of key personnel and valued customers  and our ability to close loans in the pipeline 
the company manages new commercial  including agricultural  loan origination volume using concentration limits that establish maximum exposure levels by designated industry segment  real estate product types  geography  and single borrower limits 
we expect the commercial loan portfolio to be an important contributor to growth in future revenues as we continue to seek to limit our exposure to construction and development and commercial real estate 
average total deposits declined during as compared to this decrease was mainly due to the decision to continue to reduce higher cost time deposit balances 
total average time deposits declined as a percentage of the company s average total deposits in versus the prior year 
the combination of the company s efforts to reduce higher cost time deposits and recent deposit pricing strategies to lower interest rates in concert with market conditions has helped reduce the average rate paid on total deposits in  down significantly from reverse stock split on february   bancorp implemented a for reverse split of its common stock the reverse stock split pursuant to an amendment to its restated articles of incorporation approved by shareholders on december  all share and per share related amounts in this report have been restated to reflect the reverse stock split 
as a result of the reverse stock split  every ten shares of the company s common stock issued and outstanding at the end of the effective date were combined and reclassified into one share of common stock 
bancorp did not issue fractional shares of common stock and paid cash in lieu of fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split 
cash payments for fractional shares were determined on the basis of the stock s average closing price on the nasdaq global select market for the five trading days immediately preceding the effective date  as adjusted for the reverse stock split 
also as a result of the reverse stock split  the number of outstanding shares of common stock declined from  shares to  shares 
the number of authorized shares of common stock was previously established  and remained  at  following the reverse stock split 
proportional adjustments have also been made to the conversion or exercise rights under the company s outstanding stock incentive plans  preferred stock  restricted stock  stock options and warrants 
discussion and analysis the following discussion should be read in conjunction with premierwest s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of december  and and for each of the three years in the periods ended december    and  that are included in this report 

table of contents premierwest conducts a general commercial banking business  gathering deposits and applying those funds to the origination of loans for commercial  real estate  and consumer purposes and investments 
premierwest s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated by interest earning assets principally loans and investments and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities principally customer deposits 
net interest income is affected by the difference the interest rate spread between interest rates earned on interest earning assets and interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and by the relative volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
another indicator of an institution s net interest income is its net yield on interest earning assets or net interest margin  which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
premierwest s profitability is also affected by such factors as the level of non interest income and expenses and the provision for loan loss expense 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts and fees generated through premierwest s mortgage division and investment services subsidiary 
non interest expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions and employee benefits  oreo and loan collection expenses  professional fees  equipment expenses  occupancy related expenses  communications  advertising and other operating expenses

non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap 
net interest income for twelve months ended december   was down as compared to the prior year 
this is primarily due to a decline in average interest earning assets during these periods as part of the company s deleveraging strategy 
correspondingly  average interest bearing liabilities decreased during these same periods 
changes in the balance sheet mix also contributed to declines in net interest income during these periods 
loan balances have declined through payoffs and charge offs 
investment securities have grown as a proportion of the balance sheet with loan demand continuing to be weak due to the extended economic slowdown 
as such  investment securities  which typically generate a lower yield than loans  comprise a higher percentage of earning assets 
net interest margin for increased as compared to  predominantly due to a lower cost of interest bearing deposits 
the yield earned on loans improved year over year primarily due to a reduction in the amount of interest reversed from placement of loans on non accrual in as compared to as a result  the yield on loans for the twelve months ended december  declined by basis points versus basis points for the same period in due to interest reversed from placement of loans on non accrual 
the decline in the amount of interest reversed in is due to the significant reduction in the dollar amount of loans placed on non accrual during as compared to management currently estimates that the bank remains slightly asset sensitive over the next twelve month measurement period 
as such  earning assets are forecast to mature or re price more frequently than interest bearing liabilities over this period 
management s ability to maintain or enhance the bank s net interest margin will depend in part on the ability to generate new loans  further reduce nonperforming assets and control the cost of funds 
all of these actions will depend on economic conditions  competitive factors and market interest rate trends 
for more information see the discussion under the heading quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report 
provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million in the same period last year 
while loan net charge offs in increased versus  the overall risk profile of the company s loan portfolio continues to improve 
the level of adversely classified and non performing loans has declined significantly during the past year 
in addition  the 
table of contents percentage of loans past due days and still accruing as of december  continued to be under 
the provision for credit losses will depend primarily on economic conditions  real estate valuations  and the interest rate environment  as an increase in interest rates could put pressure on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans 
for more information  see the discussion under the subheading allowance for credit losses and net loan charge offs below 
non interest income 
non interest income for the twelve months ended december  was relatively unchanged as compared to the same period in service charge income on deposit accounts declined due to a reduction in the amount of non sufficient check items from the same period in non interest income was also impacted by gains on sales of securities taken in order to reduce the proportion of lower yielding cash equivalent investments and increase the proportion of relatively higher yielding federal government guaranteed and municipal securities 
in addition  investment brokerage fee income grew from increased sales of investment products in a period of historically low deposit interest rates 
this was offset by declines in the one time gain on death benefit from bank owned life insurance and in deposit account service charge income as compared to the previous period 
in november the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued mandates on overdraft payment programs applicable to its supervised institutions  including the bank 
these restrictions were effective july  the bank began implementing changes to its overdraft payment program in the second quarter of to comply with the fdic s mandates 
the company believes these mandates  together with a change in consumer spending habits  have adversely affected non interest income

non interest expense for the twelve months ended december  declined compared to the same period in salaries and employee benefits expense decreased due to a reduction in loan workout personnel to reflect the decline in problem assets 
personnel reductions were also affected in loan production staff in response to soft loan demand due to the current economic downturn 
reductions in branch personnel were also made to correspond to the continued growth in use of non branch channels by customers to access banking services 
in addition  the company s fdic insurance premium expense declined in as compared to as a result of a change in assessment methodology beginning in and declines in asset levels average as part of the planned deleveraging of the bank 
this decrease was partially offset by larger dollar amounts of oreo write downs to current market value and expenses incurred to sell and maintain these properties 
we expect our non interest expense will continue to be affected by expenses associated with elevated levels of non performing assets

income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax provision for the twelve months ended december  and the provision was made for minimum state income taxes owed 
as of december   the company maintained a valuation allowance of million against its deferred tax asset balance of million  for no net deferred tax asset 
if the company returns to sustained profitability  all or a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be reversed 
a reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would decrease the company s income tax expense and increase net income 
balance sheet overview balance sheet highlights as of december  are as follows total assets were billion  down from december  primarily as a result of deleveraging activities  total net loans of million  declined by from the balance at december   total investment securities of million increased from december   and total deposits of billion at december   were down from year end  due to a continued shift away from time deposits and success in migrating to noninterest bearing deposits as sources of funding

declining values of commercial real estate or higher market interest rates may have a further adverse impact on the ability of borrowers with maturing loans to satisfy loan to value ratios required to renew such loans 
as indicated above  the company s loan portfolio has been concentrated in commercial real estate loans and commercial real estate loans for residential purposes during recent years  a common characteristic among community banks due to focused lending for business and consumer needs in communities within the bank s market area 
some commercial loans are secured by real estate  but funds are used for purposes other than financing the purchase of real property  such as inventory financing and equipment purchases  where real property serves as collateral for the loan 
loans of this type are characterized as real estate loans because of the real estate collateral 
since  management has taken actions in an attempt to reduce higher risk commercial real estate loan volume by directing efforts away from new commercial real estate loan production 
however  the levels of non owner occupied and land and land development commercial real estate loans remain above what

management considers a loan to be nonperforming when it is days or more past due  or sooner if the bank has determined that repayment of the loan in full is unlikely 
for commercial purpose loans  interest accrual ceases when days past due but no later than the date of acquisition by foreclosure  voluntary deed or other means and the loan is classified as nonperforming 
for consumer purpose loans  interest accrual ceases when days past due 
a loan placed on non accrual status may or may not be contractually past due at the time the determination is made to place the loan on non accrual status  and it may or may not be secured 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  it is the bank s policy to reverse interest previously accrued but uncollected 
in some instances where the loans are well secured and in the process of collection  such loans will not be placed on non accrual status 
in addition  loans that are impaired pursuant to accounting by creditors for the impairment of a loan  are classified as non accrual consistent with regulatory guidance

impaired loans are defined as loans where full recovery of contractual principal and interest is in doubt and include all non accrual and restructured commercial and real estate loans 
the dollar amount of loan impairment is determined using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral of an impaired collateral dependent loan or an observable market price 
current accounting practice and regulatory guidance places primary emphasis on appraised value for collateral dependent loans 
loan impairment is typically recognized through a charge to the allowance for loan losses reflecting any shortfall between the principal balance owing and the net realizable value of the loan

table of contents continuing actions taken to address the troubled credit situation credit monitoring activities have escalated since the fourth quarter of to provide early warning of possible borrower distress that could lead to loan payment defaults 
enhanced credit monitoring and early warnings are intended to provide additional time to seek viable alternatives with the borrower 
management and staff are actively involved in seeking loan restructuring and other loan modification options including obtaining additional collateral coverage for those borrowers who have experienced payment problems and wish to seek a workable arrangement with the company 
the company established a special asset resolution group to interface both directly with borrowers and with line managers to expedite resolution of existing and potential troubled credits 
as of december   this group had staff members 
in those instances where alternatives have been exhausted or determined to be impractical and default under the terms of the loans has occurred  foreclosure actions are pursued

improved credit risk transparency and oversight through the development of a comprehensive portfolio review package including the monitoring of relevant credit metrics internal credit examinations are completed on a significant portion of our loan portfolio periodically during the year 
a continued decline in economic conditions in our market areas and nationally  as well as other factors  could adversely impact individual borrowers or our loan portfolio in general 
as a result  we can provide no assurance that additional loans will not become days or more past due  become impaired or be placed on non accrual status  restructured or transferred to other real estate owned in the future

the company has remained focused on oreo property disposition activities during dollar volume sales were down year to date as compared to the prior year even though the number of properties sold in was higher than in the same period for this was due to the higher number of residential real estate lots sold in the largest balances in the oreo portfolio at december   were attributable to residential and commercial site development projects  followed by income producing properties  all of which are located in the regions in which we operate

the allowance for loan losses represents the company s estimate as to the probable credit losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased through periodic charges to earnings through provision for loan losses and represents the aggregate amount  net of loans charged off and recoveries on previously charged off loans  that is needed to establish an appropriate reserve for credit losses 
the allowance is estimated based on a variety of factors and using a methodology as described below the company classifies loans into relatively homogeneous pools by loan type in accordance with regulatory guidelines for regulatory reporting purposes 
the company regularly reviews all loans within each loan category to assign risk ratings to them that include pass  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
pursuant to accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan  the impaired portion of collateral dependent loans is charged off 
other loans not considered impaired have loss factors applied to the various loan pool balances to establish loss potential for provisioning purposes 
analyses are performed to establish the loss factors based on historical experience  as well as  expected losses based on qualitative evaluations of such factors as the economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  levels and trends in delinquencies  collateral valuations and impaired loans  levels and trends in charge offs and recoveries  among others 
the loss factors are applied to loan category pools segregated by risk classification to estimate the loss inherent in the company s loan portfolio pursuant to accounting for contingencies 
additionally  impaired loans are evaluated for loss potential on an individual basis in accordance with accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan  and specific reserves are established based on thorough analysis of collateral values where loss potential exists 
when an impaired loan is collateral dependent and a deficiency exists in the fair value of real estate collateralizing the loan in comparison to the associated loan balance  the deficiency is charged off at that time 
impaired loans are reviewed no less frequently than quarterly 

table of contents generally  appraisals on collateral securing adversely classified loans are updated every six to twelve months 
we obtain appraisals from a pre approved list of independent  third party appraisal firms 
approval is based on experience  reputation  character  consistency and knowledge of the respective real estate market 
at a minimum  it is ascertained that the appraiser a is currently licensed in the state in which the property is located  b is experienced in the appraisal of properties similar to the property being appraised  c is actively engaged in the appraisal work  d has knowledge of the current real estate market conditions and financing trends  e is reputable  and f is not on the bank s exclusionary list of appraisers 
our internal appraisal review department will either conduct a review of the appraisal  or will outsource the review to a qualified approved third party appraiser 
upon receipt and review  an external appraisal is utilized to measure a loan for potential impairment 
our impairment analysis documents the date of the appraisal used in the analysis  whether the preparer deems the appraisal to be current  and if not  allows for an internal valuation adjustment with justification 
any adjustments from appraised value to net realizable value are detailed and justified in the impairment analysis and reflected in the allowance for loan losses  as appropriate 
although an external appraisal is the primary source to value collateral dependent loans  we may also utilize values obtained through purchase and sale agreements  negotiated short sales  or the sales price of the note 
these alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution 
impairment analyses are updated on a quarterly basis 
based on these processes  we do not believe there are significant time lapses for the recognition of additional loan loss provisions or charge offs from the date they become known 
in the event that a current appraisal to support the fair value of the real estate collateral underlying an impaired loan has not yet been received but the company believes that the collateral value is insufficient to support the loan amount  an impairment reserve is recorded 
in these instances  the receipt of a current appraisal triggers an updated review of the collateral support for the loan and any deficiency is charged off or reserved at that time 
in those instances where a current appraisal is not available in a timely manner in relation to a financial reporting cut off date  the company s internal appraisal review department prepares or reviews a collateral valuation based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  property location  local price volatility  local economic conditions  and recent comparable sales 
in all cases  the costs to sell the subject property are deducted in arriving at the fair value of the collateral 
any unpaid property taxes or similar expenses are expensed at the time the property is acquired by the bank

loss factors used in management s estimates have declined as a result of the general reduction in net charge offs over the past several years 
overall  we believe that the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio at december   although there can be no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed our current estimates 
the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is critical to our financial results 
please see item a risk factors in this report 
net loan charge offs 
for the twelve months ended december   total net loan charge offs were up from the twelve months ended december   primarily in the real estate loan category 
this is chiefly due to a confidential master settlement agreement the company entered into on january  with its largest non performing loan relationship totaling million 
this settlement resulted in a charge off of million including a partial write down of a remaining non performing loan and a cash settlement in exchange for deeds in lieu of foreclosure and dismissal of lawsuits 
the impact on operations of this settlement was reflected in fourth quarter  whereas the company obtained possession of real property and other collateral on january  
table of contents the table provided below displays selected asset quality ratios as of december   and those same ratios adjusted for the impact of this settlement  had the collateral and real property been obtained as of december  december  actual december  adjusted for settlement allowance for loan losses to gross loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans non performing loans to gross loans non performing assets to total assets the following table shows the allocation of premierwest s allowance for loan losses by category and the percent of loans in each category to gross loans at the dates indicated 
premierwest allocates its allowance for loan losses to each loan classification based on relative risk characteristics 
general  specific and qualitative allocations are made based on estimated losses that are due to current credit circumstances and other available information for each loan category 
general allocations are based on historical loss factors 
specific allocations are related to loans on non accrual status  estimated reserves based on individual credit risk ratings  loans for which management believes the borrower might be unable to comply with loan repayment terms  even though the loans are not in non accrual status  and  loans for which supporting collateral might not be adequate to recover loan amounts if foreclosure and subsequent sale of collateral become necessary 
qualitative allocations include adjustments for economic conditions  concentrations and other subjective factors  and are intended to compensate for the subjective nature of the determination of losses inherent in the overall loan portfolio 
because the total loan loss allowance is a valuation reserve applicable to the entire loan portfolio  the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category does not necessarily represent the actual losses that may occur within that loan category 
december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses of loans in each category to total loans allowance for loan losses of loans in each category to total loans allowance for loan losses of loans in each category to total loans allowance for loan losses of loans in each category to total loans allowance for loan losses of loans in each category to total loans type of loan commercial real estate construction real estate commercial residential consumer and other total as of december   management believes that the company s total allowance for credit losses and its reserve for off balance sheet commitments are sufficient to absorb the losses inherent in the loan portfolio  related both to funded loans and unfunded commitments 
the off balance sheet commitments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
this assessment  based on both historical levels of net charge offs and continuing detailed reviews of the quality of the loan portfolio and current business  economic and regulatory conditions  involves uncertainty and judgment 
as a result  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments cannot be determined with inherent accuracy and may change in future periods 
additionally  bank regulatory authorities may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses as a result of their periodic examinations of the company and their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
if actual circumstances and losses differ substantially from management s assumptions and estimates  the allowance for loan losses might not be sufficient to absorb all future losses 
net earnings would be adversely affected if that were to occur 
total off balance sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  and overdraft protection for demand deposit account were million and million as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents despite diligent assessment by management  there can be no assurance regarding the actual amount of charge offs that will be incurred in the future 
a further slowing in the oregon and or california economies  further declines in real estate values or increased unemployment could result in increased levels of nonperforming assets and charge offs  increased loan loss provisions and reductions in income 
regulatory guidance and current accounting practice is to value all non performing assets at current appraised value less estimated costs to sell without regard to other factors or documentation 
management continues to work closely with borrowers who are motivated to resolve their financial issues through properly collateralized restructures and workouts 
management continually reviews the holding costs of certain other real estate owned in light of current market conditions

the scheduled repayment of long term borrowings and other contractual obligations is as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total years time deposits borrowings operating lease obligations junior subordinated debentures other commitments total employee benefits that include deferred compensation  executive supplemental retirement plans  employee life benefit plans and split dollar obligations accrued interest of  is included in year category capital resources the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve and the fdic have established minimum requirements for capital adequacy for bank holding companies and state non member banks 
for more information on these topics  see the discussions under the subheadings capital adequacy requirements in the section supervision and regulation included in item of this report 
the following table summarizes the capital measures of bancorp and the bank  respectively  at the dates listed below bancorp december  december  regulatory minimum to be adequately capitalized greater than or equal to total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio bank december  december  regulatory minimum to be adequately capitalized regulatory minimum to be well capitalized greater than or equal to greater than or equal to total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio although the bank meets the quantitative guidelines set forth above to be deemed well capitalized  the bank remains subject to the agreement with the fdic and  therefore  is deemed to be adequately capitalized 

table of contents bancorp s total risk based capital ratio improved from december   while its tier and leverage ratio declined during this period 
the bank s capital ratios either strengthened or remained relatively unchanged during improvements to these ratios were the result of management s strategy to deleverage the company and restructure the balance sheet to lower its risk based capital profile 
however  continued losses  primarily associated with credit resolution costs  did contribute to the decline in leverage ratios for the bancorp and bank during for more information  see discussion under the heading note regulatory agreement  economic condition and management plan 
the total risk based capital ratios of bancorp include million of junior subordinated debentures  of which million qualified as tier capital at december   under guidance issued by the federal reserve 
as provided in the dodd frank act  which was signed into law on july   bancorp expects to continue to rely on these junior subordinated debentures as part of its regulatory capital 
however  at this point  bancorp does not expect to issue additional junior subordinated debentures as any future issued junior subordinated debentures would not qualify as tier total capital under dodd frank 
liquidity and sources of funds the bank s sources of funds include customer deposits  loan repayments  advances from the fhlb  maturities of investment securities  sales of available for sale securities  loan and oreo sales  net income  if any  loans taken out at the reserve bank discount window  and the use of federal funds markets 
stated maturities of investment securities  loan repayments from maturities and core deposits are a relatively stable source of funds  while brokered deposit inflows  unscheduled loan prepayments  and loan and oreo sales are not 
deposit inflows  sales of securities  loan and oreo properties  and unscheduled loan prepayments may  amongst other factors  be influenced by general interest rate levels  interest rates available on other investments  competition  pricing consideration  and general economic conditions 
deposits are our primary source of funds 
our loan to deposit ratio has declined since december  as a result of weak loan demand due to the current economic downturn and the bank s planned initiatives to reduce the level of higher risk loans 
the decline in loan balances has resulted in an increase in the more liquid  but lower yielding investment securities portfolio 
in light of our substantial liquidity position  we continued to reduce higher cost time deposits during the most recent quarter 
the following table summarizes the primary liquidity  current ratio  net non core funding dependency  and loan to deposit ratios of the company 
the primary liquidity ratio represents the sum of net cash  short term and marketable assets and available borrowing lines divided by deposits 
the current ratio consists of the sum of net cash  short term and marketable assets divided by deposits 
the net non core funding dependency ratio is non core liabilities less short term investments divided by long term assets 
the company s primary liquidity  current ratio  and net non core funding dependency ratios remained strong at quarter end december  december  december  primary liquidity current ratio net non core funding dependency gross loans to deposits an analysis of liquidity should encompass a review of the changes that appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  the statement of cash flows includes operating  investing  and financing categories 
cash flows provided by operating activities was million with the difference between cash provided by operating activities and a net loss of million consisting primarily of noncash items of million in the 
table of contents loan loss provision and million in depreciation and amortization 
these noncash items were offset by million in write down of oreo due to impairment  million gain on sales of oreo and other foreclosed assets  and million gain on sale of investment securities 
cash flows provided by investing activities of million consisted primarily of million of proceeds from sales  calls  paydowns  and maturities of securities  million in net loan pay downs  million in proceeds from the sale of oreo  offset by million used for purchases of securities  and million used for purchases of premises and equipment 
cash flows used in financing activities of million consisted primarily of million net decrease in deposits  offset by million in net increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
at december   the bank had million in borrowings from securities sold under an agreement to repurchase with various business customers 
at this same period  the bank had no outstanding borrowings against its million in established borrowing capacity with the fhlb  as compared to letters of credit totaling  outstanding against its million in established borrowing capacity at december  the borrowing capacity at the fhlb declined from year end as the company elected to hold a higher balance of unpledged securities 
the bank s borrowing facility is subject to collateral and stock ownership requirements 
the bank also had an available discount window primary credit line with the federal reserve bank of san francisco of million  and million from a correspondent bank with no balance outstanding on either facility  both of which are pursuant to collateralized credit arrangements 
in june  bancorp entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco and dfcs 
for detailed discussion of the written agreement  see item  business supervision and regulation in this report 
under the written agreement  bancorp may not directly or indirectly take dividends or other forms of payment representing a reduction in capital from the bank without the prior written approval of the reserve bank and the dfcs 
also  under our memorandum of understanding  the bank may not pay dividends to the holding company without the consent of the fdic and the dfcs 
at december   the holding company did not have any borrowing arrangements of its own 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the bank had off balance sheet financial instruments of million compared to million at december  for additional information regarding off balance sheet arrangements and future financial commitments  see note commitments and contingent liabilities and note off balance sheet financial instruments in the financial statements included in this report

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like other financial institutions  premierwest is subject to interest rate risk 
interest earning assets could mature or re price more rapidly than  or on a different basis from  interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits with short and medium term maturities and borrowings in a period of declining interest rates 
although having assets that mature or re price more frequently on average than liabilities will be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  such an asset liability structure will result in lower net interest income during periods of declining interest rates 
despite the unprecedented level of governmental debt and economic instability  both internationally and domestically  the flight to safety by investors throughout the world has driven current domestic interest rates to historic lows 
in addition  the federal reserve bank frb has recently announced that it intends to maintain short term rates at very low levels into  given the continued sluggish economy 
the frb has stated it is managing monetary policy to provide support to the struggling housing market as a means to revive the economy 
extended periods of historically low levels generally have a dampening impact on net interest margins of financial institutions 
during such conditions  asset yields can continue to decline while the opportunities to lower deposit costs diminish 
interest rate sensitivity  or interest rate risk  relates to the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income 
interest earning assets with interest rates tied to the prime rate for example  or that mature in relatively short periods of time  are considered interest rate sensitive 
also impacting interest rate sensitivity are loans that are subject to a rate floor 
interest bearing liabilities with interest rates that can be re priced in a discretionary manner  or that mature in relatively short periods of time  are also considered interest rate sensitive 
the differences between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities over various time horizons are commonly referred to as sensitivity gaps 
as interest rates change  the sensitivity gap will have either a favorable or adverse effect on net interest income 
a negative gap with liabilities re pricing more rapidly than assets generally should have a favorable effect when interest rates are falling  and an adverse effect when rates are rising 
a positive gap with assets re pricing more rapidly than liabilities generally should have an adverse effect when rates are falling  and a favorable effect when rates are rising 

table of contents the following table illustrates the maturities or re pricing of premierwest s assets and liabilities as of december   based upon the contractual maturity or contractual re pricing dates of loans excluding nonperforming loans and the contractual maturities of time deposits and borrowings 
prepayment assumptions have not been applied to fixed rate mortgage loans 
demand loans  loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity  and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less 
by repricing interval dollars in thousands months months years over years total assets interest earning assets federal funds sold and interest earning deposits investment securities loans  net total liabilities interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand and savings time deposits borrowings junior subordinated debentures total interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative cumulative gap as a of interest earning assets for purposes of the gap analysis  loans are reduced by the allowance for loan losses  nonaccrual loans  deferred loan fees  and restructuring concessions 
this analysis of interest rate sensitivity has a number of limitations 
the gap analysis above is based upon assumptions concerning such matters as when assets and liabilities will re price in a changing interest rate environment 
because these assumptions are no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or re pricing within a stated period might actually mature or re price at different times and at different volumes from those estimated 
the actual prepayments and withdrawals after a change in interest rates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the data shown in the table 
certain assets  adjustable rate loans for example  commonly have provisions that limit changes in interest rates each time the interest rate changes and on a cumulative basis over the life of the loan 
also  the renewal or re pricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debt could diminish after an interest rate increase 
therefore  the gap table above does not and cannot necessarily indicate the actual future impact of general interest movements on net interest income 
interest rate  credit and operations risks are the most significant market risks impacting our performance 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
we rely on loan reviews  prudent loan underwriting standards and an adequate allowance for credit losses to attempt to mitigate credit risk 
interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by the asset liability management committee alco which includes senior management representatives 
the alco manages our balance sheet to maintain net interest income and present value of equity within acceptable ranges 

table of contents asset liability management simulation models are used to measure interest rate risk 
the models quantify interest rate risk by simulating forecasted net interest income over a month time horizon under various rate scenarios  as well as monitoring the change in the present value of equity under the same rate scenarios 
the present value of equity is defined as the difference between the market value of current assets less current liabilities 
by measuring the change in the present value of equity under different rate scenarios  management can identify interest rate risk that may not be evident in simulating changes in forecasted net interest income 
readers are referred to the sections  forward looking statement disclosure and risk factors of this report in connection with this discussion of market risk 
the following table shows the approximate percentage changes in forecasted net interest income over a month period under several rate scenarios 
for the net interest income analysis  three rate scenarios are compared to a stable unchanged from december  rate scenario stable rate scenario compared to percent change in net interest income up basis points up basis points down basis points as illustrated in the above table  we estimate our balance sheet was slightly asset sensitive over a month horizon at december   in the up basis points scenario meaning that interest earning assets are expected to mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities in a given period 
a decrease in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income  while an increase in market rates may increase net interest income slightly 
at december   we also estimated that our balance sheet was slightly asset sensitive 
we attempt to limit our interest rate risk through managing the repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
for the present value of equity analysis  the results are compared to the net present value of equity using the yield curve as of december  this curve is then shifted up and down and the net present value of equity is computed 
this table does not include flattening or steepening yield curve effects 
december  change in interest rates percent change in present value of equity up basis points up basis points down basis points it should be noted that the simulation model does not take into account future management actions that could be undertaken should a change occur in actual market interest rates during the year 
also  certain assumptions are required to perform modeling simulations that may have a significant impact on the results 
these include important assumptions regarding the level of interest rates and balance changes on deposit products that do not have stated maturities  as well as the relationship between loan yields and deposit rates relative to market interest rates 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of industry standards and future expected pricing behavior but could be significantly influenced by future competitor pricing behavior 
the model also includes assumptions about changes in the composition or mix of the balance sheet 
the results derived from the simulation model could vary significantly due to external factors such as changes in the prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits and competition 
any transaction activity will also have an impact on the asset liability position as new assets are acquired and added
