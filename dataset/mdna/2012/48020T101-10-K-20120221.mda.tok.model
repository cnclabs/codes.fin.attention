item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information and analysis of our results of operations from through  and our liquidity and capital resources 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
executive overview we design  contract for the manufacture of and market a broad range of women s collection sportswear  suits and dresses  casual sportswear and jeanswear for women and children and women s and men s footwear and accessories 
we sell our products through a broad array of distribution channels  including better specialty and department stores and mass merchandisers  primarily in the united states  canada and europe 
we also operate our own network of retail and factory outlet stores and several e commerce web sites 
in addition  we license the use of several of our brand names to select manufacturers and distributors of women s and men s apparel and accessories worldwide 
during to date  the following significant events took place on february   we announced the launch of shoelaborations  a creative platform that seeks talented individuals doing original work in their unique artistic areas and allows them the opportunity to collaborate on a rotating basis with nine west  on march   we announced that we successfully issued million of senior notes due  on april   we announced an amendment and extension of our existing million senior credit facility to provide for additional international subfacilities and a decrease in fees and interest rates to current market rates and to extend the maturity date to april   on june   we announced that we had acquired kurt geiger  a privately held wholesaler and retailer of luxury footwear and accessories  on july   we announced that we had entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with philip simon brands group  inc for the creation  production  marketing and global distribution of a fashion sneaker collection under the nine west brand  and on september   we announced that we had entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with marchon eyewear  inc for the creation  production  marketing and global distribution of ophthalmic eyewear frames and prescription ready sunglasses under the nine west brand 
trends the uncertain economic and political environments have resulted in fluctuating consumer confidence 
rising energy  gasoline and other prices are reducing consumers discretionary income 
this may lead to reduced consumer spending  which could affect our net sales and our future profitability 
we also believe that several significant trends are occurring in the apparel  footwear and accessories industry 
we believe the recent general increase in commodity  labor and transportation costs that we have experienced may continue into the future 
we may be limited in our ability to increase our selling prices to offset these increases 
should the consumer not accept higher retail prices for our products  our margins could be adversely affected 
we believe a trend exists among our major customers to expand the differentiation of their offerings and to achieve strategic advantages over competitors by devoting more resources to the development of exclusive products whether products that the retailer designs under brands that it owns private labels or products produced exclusively for the retailer by national brand manufacturers 
retailers are placing more emphasis on developing their brand images and building strong images for their private label merchandise 
exclusive brands  as the term implies  are only available from a specific retailer  and thus customers loyal to these brands can only find them in the stores of that retailer 
we have responded to this trend by leveraging our design  production and marketing capabilities to develop and provide private label products for certain customers and to provide products under certain of our brands exclusively to select customers  such as providing lei products exclusively to walmart  rachel rachel roy products exclusively to macy s in the us and glo products exclusively to kmart 
while the private label lines compete directly with our product lines and may receive more prominent positioning on the retail floor by department stores  creating more competition  we believe that national brands are often preferred by the consumer 
furthermore  we believe a trend exists among our major customers to concentrate purchasing among a narrowing group of vendors 
in the future  retailers may have financial problems or continue to consolidate  undergo restructurings or reorganizations  or realign their affiliations  any of which could increase the concentration of our customers 
we attempt to minimize our credit risk from our concentration of customers by closely monitoring accounts receivable balances and shipping levels and the ongoing financial performance and credit status of our customers 
consumers are increasing their purchasing of apparel  footwear and accessories through e commerce web sites 
through our web sites  we market either footwear and accessories  apparel or a combination of these products  primarily under their respective brand names 
the selection of products is substantially consistent with the product offerings in our corresponding retail store concepts 
our e commerce systems allow us to fulfill customer orders from inventory at our retail store locations if the items are not available at our distribution center 
on january   the world trade organization s member nations lifted all quotas on apparel and textiles 
as a result  all textiles and textile apparel manufactured in a member nation and exported after january  are no longer subject to quota restrictions 
a special safeguard provision that had provided the us with an additional four years beyond january  to apply quotas on chinese imports of textiles expired on december  the lifting of quotas and expiration of safeguard provisions allows retailers  apparel firms and others to import unlimited quantities of apparel and textile items from china  india and other lower cost countries  which could lead to relatively lower production costs  allow us to improve the quality of our products for a given cost  or allow us to concentrate production in the most efficient markets 
in addition  if the prices of the imported goods can be shown to be less than those offered by domestic producers for the same items  the us international trade commission may recommend that anti dumping duties be imposed on those goods 
as a result  we are unable to predict the long term effects of the lifting of quota restrictions and related events on our results of operations 
retail store closings we continue to review our retail operations for underperforming locations 
as a result of these reviews  we have decided to close retail locations that no longer provide strategic benefits 
during  and  we closed  and locations  respectively  and anticipate closing additional locations in total termination benefits and associated employee costs are expected to be million for approximately  employees  including both store employees and administrative support personnel 
we accrued million  million and million of termination benefits and associated employee costs during  and  respectively 
in connection with our decision to close these stores  we reviewed the associated long term assets for impairments 
as a result of these reviews  we recorded million  million and million of impairment losses in  and  respectively  on leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures located in the stores to be closed 
these costs are reported as selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in the domestic retail segment 
acquisition of kurt geiger on june   we acquired of the equity interests in kurt geiger  a privately held wholesaler and retailer of luxury footwear and accessories  for million in cash and the assumption of million of debt  which was immediately repaid following the transaction 
kurt geiger markets products under four of its own brands kurt geiger  kg  carvela and miss kg and over other luxury brands in more than retail locations  including concessions in europe s leading department stores  including harrods  selfridges  liberty  house of fraser  fenwick john lewis and brown thomas  as well as company operated stores 
approximately million of the purchase price payable to certain selling shareholders who are senior managers of kurt geiger has been rolled over into loan notes the loan notes  which are payable no later than april  and are subject to forfeiture in the event of termination of employment under certain circumstances 
this amount is recorded as compensation expense over the term of the loan notes and is not reported as a component of the cost of the acquisition 
we pursued the acquisition of kurt geiger to increase our international presence and further extend our reach into the designer footwear business 
kurt geiger will serve as our hub in europe 
kurt geiger s wholesale footwear business is reported in our international wholesale segment and its retail business is reported in our international retail segment 
critical accounting policies several of our accounting policies involve significant or complex judgements and uncertainties and require us to make certain critical accounting estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions that are subjective in nature or are about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made 
the estimates with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include the collectibility of accounts receivable  the recovery value of obsolete or overstocked inventory and the fair values of goodwill  intangible assets with indefinite lives and acquisition consideration liabilities 
estimates related to accounts receivable and inventory affect all of our segments 
estimates related to goodwill affect our domestic wholesale sportswear  international wholesale and international retail segments 
estimates related to intangible assets with indefinite lives affect our domestic footwear and accessories  international wholesale  international retail  licensing  other and eliminations segment 
for accounts receivable  we estimate the net collectibility  considering both historical and anticipated trends of trade discounts and co op advertising deductions taken by our customers  allowances we provide to our retail customers to flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of our customers 
for inventory  we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods to the recovery value expected to be realized through off price channels 
historically  actual results in these areas have not been materially different than our estimates  and we do not anticipate that our estimates and assumptions are likely to materially change in the future 
however  if we incorrectly anticipate trends or unexpected events occur  our results of operations could be materially affected 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
accounting rules generally require that we test at least annually for possible goodwill impairment 
we test our goodwill and our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis during our fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying value 
as a result of the impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill balance existing in our retail segment was impaired as a result of decreases in projected revenues  profitability and cash flows for the segment 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
there were no impairment charges as a result of the or impairment analyses 
we perform our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year 
as a result of the  and impairment analyses  we recorded trademark impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  as a result of decreases in projected revenues and cash flows for certain brands 
all trademark impairment charges are reported as sg a expenses in the licensing  other and eliminations segment 
for more information  see goodwill and other intangible assets in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we test both our goodwill and our trademarks for impairment by utilizing discounted cash flow models to estimate their fair values 
these cash flow models involve several assumptions 
changes in our assumptions could materially impact our fair value estimates 
assumptions critical to our fair value estimates are i discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair value of the reporting units and trademarks  ii royalty rates used in our trademark valuations  iii projected average revenue growth rates used in the reporting unit and trademark models  and iv projected long term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values 
these and other assumptions are impacted by economic and market conditions as well as expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
based on our latest annual testing  the following table shows the assumptions we used to derive our fair value estimates and the hypothetical additional impairment charge for goodwill and trademarks resulting from a one percentage point unfavorable change in each of our fair value assumptions dollar amounts in millions 
assumptions effect of one percentage point unfavorable change in goodwill trademarks goodwill trademarks discount rates none royalty rates weighted average revenue growth rates none long term growth rates none at december   we had million of goodwill  of which million has been assigned to the domestic sportswear segment  million has been assigned to the domestic wholesale footwear and accessories segment  million has been assigned to the international wholesale segment and million has been assigned to the international retail segment 
the goodwill assigned to the domestic wholesale footwear and accessories segment is the result of the swh acquisition  the goodwill assigned to the international wholesale segment is the result of the swh and kurt geiger acquisitions  and the goodwill assigned to the international retail segment is the result of the kurt geiger acquisition 
the fair value of each operating segment at december  significantly exceeded the segment s carrying value 
we also had million of indefinite lived trademarks 
should economic conditions and trends such as reduced consumer spending or the failure to achieve projected results deteriorate throughout and beyond  especially in the united kingdom and europe  the carrying values of trademarks and goodwill could become impaired 
at december   we had a total of million accrued for contingent consideration payments relating to the acquisitions of moda and swh 
these liabilities represent the present value  discounted at our weighted average cost of capital  of the projected payments based on i for moda  projected revenues and probability weighted gross margins for the years through  and ii for swh  probability weighted projected earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the acquisition agreement for through these and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
other than the assumptions used in the impairment testing of our goodwill and trademarks  we have not made any material changes to any of our critical accounting estimates in the last three years 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
changes to operating segments with the addition of kurt geiger on june   we have redefined our reportable operating segments to better reflect our expanding international operations 
our operations are now comprised of six reportable segments domestic wholesale sportswear  domestic wholesale jeanswear  domestic wholesale footwear and accessories  domestic retail  international wholesale and international retail

we expect to fund the expenditures from cash generated by operations 
cash flows from financing activities provided million in  primarily as the result of the issuance of million of senior notes due the notes 
uses of cash during this period were primarily for the repayment of acquired kurt geiger debt  debt issuance and financing costs  the repurchase of our common stock  the payment of dividends and payments related to the acquisition consideration payable from the swh acquisition 
in march  we issued the notes 
net proceeds were million  of which million was used to repay amounts then outstanding under our secured revolving credit agreement 
cash flows from financing activities used million in  primarily for a cash distribution of million to the former owners of swh as required by the acquisition agreement  dividends to our common shareholders  repurchases of our common stock and costs related to our secured revolving credit agreement 
cash flows from financing activities used million in  primarily for the repurchase of our notes and associated costs and consent fees  costs related to our new secured revolving credit agreement  and the payment of dividends to our common shareholders 
on april   we commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of our outstanding notes  as well as a consent solicitation to amend the indenture governing our outstanding notes  our senior notes due and our senior notes due collectively  the notes 
the purpose of the consent solicitation was to receive the consent of holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the notes outstanding for proposed amendments to the indenture to provide for a carveout to the lien covenant  for liens incurred in connection with the new senior secured credit facility described above 
we received the required consents on april   consequently  the amendments became operative upon payment of the consent fee to each validly consenting holder of the notes  and are binding on all holders  including non consenting holders of notes 
under the tender offer  we repurchased a total of million of our outstanding notes for a payment of million  and we paid million in consent fees to holders of the notes and million of related costs  resulting in a loss on debt extinguishment of million 
of the consent fees paid  a net million relates to the remaining outstanding notes and will be amortized over the life of the remaining related notes as additional interest expense 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million in  and we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million in we repurchased no common stock during as of december   million of board authorized repurchases was still available 
additional share repurchases in the future will depend on  among other things  market conditions and our financial condition  although any such repurchases will be subject to limitations under our current revolving credit agreement 
our board of directors has authorized our common stock repurchases as a tax effective means to enhance shareholder value and distribute cash to shareholders and  to a lesser extent  to offset the impact of dilution resulting from the issuance of shares of restricted stock and the exercise of employee stock options 
we believe that we have sufficient sources of funds to repurchase shares without significantly impacting our short term or long term liquidity 
in authorizing future share repurchase programs  our board of directors gives careful consideration to our projected cash flows  our existing capital resources and repurchase limitations under our current revolving credit agreement 
we have a secured revolving credit agreement expiring on april  the credit facility with several lending institutions to borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to million 
the terms and conditions of our credit facility provide for  among other things a million us commitment which may be drawn by the us borrowers as revolving loans in us dollars or letters of credit in canadian dollars  us dollars  or an lc alternative currency namely euros  sterling  or any other currency acceptable to the lenders  and a million international commitment which may be drawn by the us borrowers or by any canadian or european borrowers as revolving loans or letters of credit in canadian dollars  us dollars  or an lc alternative currency 
up to the entire amount of the credit facility is available for cash borrowings  with up to million available for all letters of credit  and additional sublimits on letters of credit including but not limited to million for standby letters of credit  million for trade letters of credit  and million for letters of credit under the us commitment denominated in an lc alternative currency 
borrowings under the credit facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness  to make certain investments including acquisitions  and for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business 
such borrowings bear interest either based on the alternate base rate  as defined in the credit facility  or based on eurocurrency rates  each with a margin that depends on the availability remaining under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains customary events of default 
availability under the credit facility is determined with reference to a borrowing base consisting of a percentage of eligible inventory  accounts receivable  credit card receivables and licensee receivables  minus reserves determined by the joint collateral agents 
at december   we had no cash borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding  and our remaining availability was million 
if availability under the credit facility falls below a stated level  we will be required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  will limit or restrict our ability to incur indebtedness  create liens  merge  consolidate  liquidate or dissolve  make investments including acquisitions  loans or advances  sell assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  enter into swap agreements  make certain restricted payments including dividends and other payments in respect of capital stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into restrictive agreements  and amend material documents 
the credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our personal property 
swh has a million unsecured borrowing facility with a lending institution that expires on october  and is renewable on an annual basis  under which no cash borrowings and million in letters of credit were outstanding at december  cash borrowings under this facility bear interest based on either the prevailing prime rate or the prevailing libor rate plus basis points 
swh also has a million variable rate unsecured borrowing facility with a european lending institution that expires in march and is renewable on an annual basis  under which no amounts were outstanding at december  proceeds from the issuance of common stock to our employees exercising stock options amounted to million in no employees exercised stock options in or we recorded net pension expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  to other comprehensive income resulting primarily from a lowering of the discount rate used to determine projected pension benefits in all periods and investment losses in our pension and postretirement plans are currently underfunded by a total of million 
as the benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are frozen with respect to service credits  the effects on future pension expense are not anticipated to be material to our results of operations or to our liquidity 
we contributed million and million to our defined benefit plans in and  respectively 
we expect to contribute million to our defined benefit plans in on february   we announced that our board of directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share to all common stockholders of record as of february  for payment on march  economic outlook the uncertain economic and political environments have resulted in fluctuating consumer confidence 
rising energy  gasoline and other prices are reducing consumers discretionary income 
this may lead to reduced consumer spending from recent experience  which could affect our net sales and our future profitability 
reduced consumer spending  combined with rising costs related to changes in foreign exchange rates  increasing labor costs primarily in asia  commodity prices and increasing transportation costs  may reduce our gross profit margins from present levels 
we may be limited in our ability to increase our selling prices to offset rising costs 
should the consumer not accept higher retail prices for our products  these rising costs would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our products are manufactured in many foreign countries  including china  brazil  spain and italy 
due to the current and expected future economic relationship between the united states and china  we may experience increased risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates should china allow the yuan to rise in value against the dollar 
we may also experience increased risk related to changes in foreign currency rates between the euro  british pound and the dollar due to economic conditions in europe 
should either of these occur  increased production costs for our goods manufactured in china  spain and italy could result 
when adverse economic conditions exist in the united states or abroad  we may experience increased risk related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable  and we may increase our provision for doubtful accounts in the future should any of our wholesale customers experience significant financial difficulties 
if such conditions lead to defaults that are individually or cumulatively significant  we could experience a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and or liquidity 
the economic turmoil in the credit markets over the past several years and the negative effects of the economic environment on our business may negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future 
however  we believe that available cash and cash equivalents  funds generated by operations and the credit facility will provide the financial resources sufficient to meet our foreseeable working capital  dividend  capital expenditure and stock repurchase requirements and fund our contractual obligations and our acquisition liabilities and commitments 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that the participating banks will be willing and able to loan funds to us in accordance with their legal obligations under the credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of sec regulation s k item a 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations for the periods indicated that existed as of december   and  except for purchase obligations and other long term liabilities  is based on information appearing in the notes to consolidated financial statements amounts in millions

includes outstanding trade letters of credit of million  which primarily represent inventory purchase commitments which typically mature in two to six months and excludes million of standby letters of credit  for which we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing and amounts if any to be paid

asu simplifies how entities  both public and nonpublic  test goodwill for impairment

is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position

asu provides for additional disclosures of both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
this scope would include derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods  and disclosures required by these amendments should be provided retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu defers the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
asu did not defer the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
the amendments are effective at the same time as the amendments in asu item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in the market value of our fixed rate long term debt 
we manage this exposure through regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our policy allows the use of derivative financial instruments for identifiable market risk exposures  including interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading or other speculative purposes 
the following quantitative disclosures were derived using quoted market prices  yields and theoretical pricing models obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments  taking into consideration the underlying terms  such as the coupon rate  term to maturity and embedded call options 
certain items such as lease contracts  insurance contracts  and obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits were not included in the analysis 
for further information see derivatives and financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rates our primary interest rate exposures relate to the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt and interest expense related to our revolving credit facility 
at december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt was million 
on that date  the potential decrease in fair value of our fixed rate long term debt instruments resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates was approximately million 
our primary interest rate exposures on variable rate credit facilities are with respect to united states and canadian short term rates 
cash borrowings under these facilities bear interest at rates that vary with changes in prevailing market rates 
at december   we had million in variable rate credit facilities  under which no cash borrowings and million of letters of credit were outstanding 
at december   we had outstanding interest rate swaps to convert our million senior notes due the notes to variable rate debt and an interest rate cap to limit our exposure to increases in the variable rates of our interest rate swaps 
under the terms of the swap contracts  we are required to make semiannual variable rate payments to the counterparties calculated based on three month libor rates which are reset on the th day of each calendar quarter plus  and the counterparties are obligated to make semiannual fixed rate payments to us of 
we also have an interest rate cap that limits our three month libor rate exposure to 
the swap and cap transactions have a termination date of november   the date the notes mature 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of million and the fair value of the interest rate cap was an asset of million 
the maximum future net cash payments that could be made under these contracts are estimated to be million 
foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our products have historically been purchased from foreign manufacturers in pre set united states dollar prices 
with the acquisition of swh and kurt geiger  we also purchase certain products in euros and pounds 
we also have assets  liabilities and intercompany accounts denominated in certain foreign currencies that generate exchange gains and losses as exchange rates change 
to date  we generally have not been materially adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
at december   we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to exchange canadian dollars for a total notional value of us million at a weighted average exchange rate of maturing through march the fair value of these contracts at december  was a million unrealized gain 
we believe that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we are exposed to credit related losses if the counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform its obligation 
however  we do not expect the counterparty  which presently has a high credit rating  to fail to meet its obligations
