in the fourth quarter of fiscal  cintas repatriated approximately million of cash from foreign subsidiaries 
we expect to use the remaining amounts located outside of the us to fund our international operations and international expansion activities 
no marketable securities were outstanding at may  we believe that our investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative 
the primary criterion used in making investment decisions is the preservation of principal  while earning an attractive yield 
cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity 
we generally use these cash flows to fund most  if not all  of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock 
we may also use cash flows provided by operating activities  as well as proceeds from long term debt and short term borrowings  to fund growth and expansion opportunities  as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  an increase of million compared to fiscal along with the increase in net income  the decrease in inventory during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal also had a positive impact on our operating cash flow

we completed the may  share buyback program by purchasing million shares of cintas common stock for a total of million by the end of september  on october   we announced that the board of directors authorized an additional million share buyback program at market prices 
beginning in april  under the october  share buyback program  we purchased million shares of cintas common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a total of million of cintas common stock being repurchased through may  we completed the october  share buyback program by purchasing an additional million shares of cintas common stock in june and july for an aggregate purchase price of million 
from the inception of the october  share buyback program through july   cintas purchased a total of million shares of cintas common stock at an average price of per share for a total purchase price of million

for the fiscal year ended may   cintas acquired approximately  shares of cintas common stock in trade for employee payroll taxes due on restricted stock awards that vested during the fiscal year 
these shares were acquired at an average price of per share 
we paid an annual cash dividend of million  or per share  in december on a per share basis  this dividend is an increase of over the dividend paid in fiscal this marks the th consecutive year that cintas has increased its annual dividend  every year since going public in as of may   we had  million aggregate principal amount in fixed rate senior notes outstanding with maturities ranging from to on may   cintas issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due bearing an interest rate of and an additional million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due bearing an interest rate of 
the interest on both tranches of these senior notes are paid semi annually 
the net proceeds generated from the offerings were used to repay our outstanding commercial paper borrowings  purchase shares of cintas common stock under the october  share buyback program and other general corporate purchases 
as of may   we also had outstanding million of year senior notes issued in fiscal at a rate of  million of year senior notes issued in fiscal at a rate of and million of year senior notes issued in fiscal at a rate of

cintas commercial paper program has a capacity of million that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a credit agreement with its banking group 
this revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of million 
the revolving credit facility was amended on october   to extend the maturity date from september  to october   to improve the applicable margin used to calculate the interest rate payable on any outstanding loans and the facility fee payable under the agreement and to replace the financial covenant regarding cintas net funded indebtedness to total capitalization with a requirement to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization debt to ebitda of no more than to we believe this program  along with cash generated from operations  will be adequate to provide necessary funding for our future cash requirements 
no commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may  or cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements 
these covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens  to engage in sale leaseback transactions and to merge  consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets 
these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to ebitda and interest coverage ratios 
cross default provisions exist between certain debt instruments 
if a default of a significant covenant were to occur  the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness  impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital 
as of may   cintas was in compliance with all significant debt covenants 
our access to the commercial paper and long term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity 
we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past 
our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend  to a significant degree  on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness 
as of may   our ratings were as follows rating agency outlook commercial paper long term debt standard poor s stable a bbb moody s investors service stable p a in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason  or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above  particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings  our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected 
in addition  in such a case  our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above 
the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities 
each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
moreover  each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 
to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long term financing  we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors 
one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda 
for the purpose of this calculation  debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings  long term debt due within one year  obligations under capital leases due in one year  long term debt and long term obligations under capital leases 
contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total one year or less two to three years four to five years after five years long term debt operating leases interest payments interest swap agreements unconditional purchase obligations total long term contractual cash obligations cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans 
the amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas 
future contributions are expected to increase approximately to annually 
based on that increase  payments due in one year or less would be million  two to three years would be million and four to five years would be million 
payments for years thereafter are expected to continue increasing by approximately each year 
long term debt primarily consists of  million in senior notes 
reference note entitled long term debt and derivatives of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of long term debt 
operating leases consist primarily of operational facility leases 
interest payments could include interest on both fixed and variable rate debt 
as of may   cintas did not have commercial paper outstanding  and therefore did not have any variable rate debt 
rates have been assumed to remain constant in fiscal  increase basis points in both fiscal and  increase basis points in both fiscal and and increase a total of basis points beyond fiscal other commitments in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period total one year or less two to three years four to five years after five years lines of credit standby letters of credit guarantees standby repurchase obligations other commercial commitments total other commitments back up facility for the commercial paper program reference note entitled long term debt and derivatives of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

litigation and other contingencies cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business  including personal injury  customer contract  environmental and employment claims 
in the opinion of management  the aggregate liability  if any  with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of cintas

new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity and requires an entity to present either one continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or two separate  but consecutive  statements 
this new guidance is effective for cintas for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending may   and is to be applied retrospectively 
cintas does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued new guidance with respect to the annual goodwill impairment test  which adds a qualitative assessment that allows companies to determine whether they need to perform the two step impairment test 
the objective of the guidance is to simplify how companies test goodwill for impairment and  more specifically  to reduce the cost and complexity of performing the goodwill impairment test 
the guidance may change how the goodwill impairment test is performed  but should not change the timing or measurement of goodwill impairments 
the qualitative screen is effective for companies with fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for all companies 
cintas will consider the new guidance in performing its annual goodwill impairment test  however  it was not early adopted in fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note entitled significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant changes  estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental revenue  which is recorded in the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment  is recognized when services are performed 
other services revenue  which is recorded in the uniform direct sales  first aid  safety and fire protection services and document management services operating segments  is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts cintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance includes an estimate based on historical rates of collectability and allowances for specific accounts identified as uncollectible 
the allowance that is an estimate based on the company s historical rates of collectability is recorded for overdue amounts  beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages 
the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment and the three other operating segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each operating segment 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances 
the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market 
an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification  as well as an estimate based on the company s historical rates of obsolescence 
uniforms and other rental items in service uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization  calculated using the straight line method 
uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing are amortized over their useful life of months 
other rental items  including shop towels  mats  mops  cleanroom garments  flame resistant clothing  linens and restroom dispensers  are amortized over their useful lives  which range from to months 
the amortization rates used are based on industry experience  cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas 
these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and company specific experience  which is typically to years for buildings  to years for building improvements  to years for equipment and to years for leasehold improvements 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets  as appropriate 
long lived assets that are held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the estimated fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
goodwill and impairment goodwill  obtained through acquisitions of businesses  is valued at cost less any impairment 
cintas completes an annual impairment test which includes the determination of the estimated fair value of its reporting units 
this test includes comparisons to current market values  where available  and discounted cash flow analyses 
significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth  as well as discount rates 
the methodology used is consistent with prior years 
based on the results of the annual impairment tests  cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may   or service contracts and other assets service contracts and other assets  which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses  are amortized by use of the straight line method over the estimated lives of the agreements  which are generally to years 
certain noncompete agreements  as well as all service contracts  require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates  among other factors 
because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets  actual results over time could vary from original estimates 
impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification 
no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may   or stock based compensation compensation expense is recognized for all share based payments to employees  including stock options and restricted stock awards  in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted 
the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
measured compensation cost  net of estimated forfeitures  is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related share based compensation award

litigation and environmental matters cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business 
us gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities  cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed in note entitled litigation and other contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
see note entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes 
deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date 
cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets  as adjusted for valuation allowances  will be realized 
cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate 
based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions  cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt and investing in marketable securities 
earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper 
if short term rates changed by one half percent or basis points  cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
this estimated exposure considers the effects on investments and the change in the cost of variable rate debt 
this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 
through its foreign operations  cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than of cintas consolidated revenue and profit 
cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows 
the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar
