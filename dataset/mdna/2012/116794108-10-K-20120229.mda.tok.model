financial overview for the year ended december   our revenue increased by million  or  to  million  compared to  million for the year ended december  included in this change in revenue is an increase of approximately million from the impact of foreign exchange due to the weakening of the us dollar versus the euro  swiss franc and other foreign currencies and an increase of approximately million attributable to recent acquisitions 
excluding the effects of foreign exchange and our recent acquisitions  revenue increased by million  or 
the increase in revenue on an adjusted basis is attributable to both the scientific instruments segment  which increased by million  or  and the energy supercon technologies segment  which increased by million  or 
revenue in the scientific instruments segment reflects an increase in sales from many of our core technologies  particularly x ray and elemental analysis  magnetic resonance  mass spectrometry and molecular spectroscopy products 
the mix of products sold in the scientific instruments segment during reflects increased demand from academic  government and industrial customers 
we attribute the increase in sales to academic and government customers to increased spending from these customers  to new product introductions and to stimulus packages implemented by governments of various countries  particularly the us we continue to closely monitor spending patterns from governments and academic customers and we believe that funding for our products will remain stable  or grow  in most of our key markets 
the improvement in revenues from our industrial customers reflects continued growth in these end markets and our new product introductions 
revenues in the energy supercon technologies segment increased due to higher demand for low temperature superconducting wire 
income from operations for the year ended december  was million  resulting in an operating margin of  compared to income from operations of million  resulting in an operating margin of  for the year ended december  included in income from operations are various charges to inventory  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and other acquisition related costs  deferred offering costs that have been written off and legal and other professional services fees related to our internal fcpa investigation totaling  in the aggregate  million and million in and  respectively 
excluding these charges  operating margins were in and in operating margins decreased  despite growth in our revenues and gross profits  because of the mix of products sold and higher operating expenses 

table of contents gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  our gross profit margin for the year ended december  was  compared with for the year ended december  however  excluding the effect of inventory reserves related to certain specialty magnets and the effects of recently completed acquisitions  including amortization expense totaling  in the aggregate million and million in and  respectively  gross profit margins decreased to in compared with in gross profit margins in benefitted from the higher revenues described above and sales of our newly introduced products which were designed to carry higher gross margins than our previous generations of products 
in addition  our acquisition of the nano surfaces business had a positive impact on our gross profit margins in however  the mix of products sold  including our gas chromatography and inductively coupled plasma products  negatively impacted our gross profit margins 
the chemical analysis business contributed to lower gross profit margins due to higher than planned production costs which were caused  in part  by costs and lost production time associated with relocating factories from former varian inc sites to our own facilities 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the strengthening of the euro and swiss franc  also contributed to the increase because the majority of our production facilities are located in europe 
selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in is attributable to increases in headcount from our recent acquisitions and increases in headcount to support planned revenue growth in our existing businesses 
we also incurred higher commission expenses as a result of increases in new orders and revenues 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the strengthening of the euro and swiss franc  also contributed to the increase because the majority of our employees are located in europe 
we are focused on controlling costs and are implementing selective cost saving programs with the goal of reducing operating expenses and improving operating margins in we incurred approximately million of interest expense during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense relates primarily to increases in the amounts borrowed under the revolving portion of our credit agreement 
the increase in outstanding revolving loans is attributable to million that we borrowed in october to finance the acquisition and short term working capital requirements of the nano surfaces business and an additional million that we borrowed in september to finance the acquisition of the tribology business and for general corporate purposes 
in may  we entered into an amendment and restatement of our credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement increased the maximum commitment on our revolving credit line to million and extended the maturity date on the revolving line of credit to may in addition  in january we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of accredited institutional investors 
under the note purchase agreement we issued and sold million of senior notes that consisted of million of senior notes due january   million of senior notes due january   million of senior notes due january   and million of senior notes due january  we used a portion of the net proceeds from the senior notes to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and intend to use the remainder for general corporate purposes 
our effective tax rate for was  compared to for our provision for income taxes in includes approximately million of tax expense from additional reserves recorded in connection with ongoing tax audits in germany and switzerland 
in  we recorded reserves of million related to the tax audit in switzerland 
the change in our effective tax rate  excluding the increase in reserves for tax audits  relates primarily to reversing certain valuation allowances in the united states 

table of contents our net income attributable to the shareholders of bruker corporation for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  the expensing and capitalization of research and developments costs for software  stock based compensation expense  restructuring and other related charges  income taxes  including the recoverability of deferred tax assets  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  estimated fair values of long lived assets used to evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill  expected future cash flows used to evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and long lived assets  warranty costs  derivative financial instruments and contingent liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current market and economic conditions  industry trends and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from system sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally are transferred to the customer upon receipt of a signed customer acceptance form for a system that has been shipped  installed  and for which the customer has been trained 
as a result  the timing of customer acceptance or readiness could cause our reported revenues to differ materially from expectations 
when products are sold through an independent distributor or a strategic distribution partner who assumes responsibility for installation  we recognize the system sale when the product has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the distributor 
our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights of return  however  our products are typically warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year 
revenue is deferred until cash is received when collectability is not reasonably assured  such as when a significant portion of the fee is due over one year after delivery  installation and acceptance of a system 
for arrangements with multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each element  using the relative selling price method 
the fair value of each element is based on our vendor specific objective evidence  if available 
if vendor specific objective evidence is not available we use evidence from third parties or when third party evidence is not available  we use management s best estimate of the selling price 
revenue from accessories and parts is recognized upon shipment and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
we also have contracts for which we apply the percentage of completion model of revenue recognition and the milestone method of revenue recognition 
application of the percentage of completion method requires us to make reasonable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion of the contract and the total costs we will incur under the contract 
changes in our estimates could affect the timing of revenue recognition 

table of contents income taxes 
the determination of income tax expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments concerning the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the deductions  carryforwards and credits that are available to reduce taxable income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial statement and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be settled 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and we provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used for which a reserve has been provided  we reverse the related valuation allowance 
if our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differs from estimates  additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary 
in addition  we only recognize benefits for tax positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained upon review by a taxing authority with knowledge of all relevant information 
we reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and any changes to these positions as a result of tax audits  tax laws or other facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required  resulting in a charge to operations 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with costs determined by the first in  first out method for a majority of subsidiaries and by average cost for certain international subsidiaries 
we record provisions to account for excess and obsolete inventory to reflect the expected non saleable or non refundable inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products 
inventories also include demonstration units located in our demonstration laboratories or installed at the sites of potential customers 
we consider our demonstration units to be available for sale 
we reduce the carrying value of demonstration inventories for differences between cost and estimated net realizable value  taking into consideration usage in the preceding twelve months  expected demand  technological obsolescence and other information including the physical condition of the unit 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional write downs may be required  resulting in additional charges to operations 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we evaluate whether goodwill is impaired annually and when events occur or circumstances change 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is the operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
in  an amendment to the goodwill impairment guidance was issued that provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary before performing the two step test that was previously required 
the qualitative assessment requires significant judgments by management about macro economic conditions including the entity s operating environment  its industry and other market considerations  entity specific events related to financial performance or loss of key personnel  and other events that could impact the reporting unit 
we adopted the provisions of this amendment for our annual test of impairment as of december  and concluded  based on our qualitative assessment  that no further testing was required 
in the future  if we conclude that further testing is required  the impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method 
estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant judgments by management about the future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment 
in the second 
table of contents step of the goodwill impairment test we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we also review finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets when indications of potential impairment exist  such as a significant reduction in undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets 
should the fair value of our long lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary 
warranty costs 
we normally provide a one year parts and labor warranty with the purchase of equipment 
the anticipated cost for this warranty is accrued upon recognition of the sale based on historical warranty rates and our assumptions of future warranty claims 
the warranty accrual is included as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
although our products undergo quality assurance and testing procedures throughout the production process  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
although our actual warranty costs have historically been consistent with expectations  to the extent warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from our estimates  revisions to the warranty accrual may be required 
derivative financial instruments 
all derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities at fair value  which is calculated as an estimate of the future cash flows  and subsequent changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized in income  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur 
we perform an assessment at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter  to determine whether our derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items 
any changes in the fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness are immediately recognized as income or expense

table of contents exchange due to the weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and other foreign currencies and an increase of approximately million attributable to our recent acquisitions 
excluding the effect of foreign exchange and our recent acquisitions  revenue increased by million  or 
the increase in revenue  on an adjusted basis  is attributable to both the scientific instruments segment  which increased by million  or  and the energy supercon technologies segment  which increased by million  or 
revenue in the scientific instruments segment reflects an increase in sales many of our core technologies 
revenue in the energy supercon technologies segment increased due to higher demand for low temperature superconducting wire 
revenue in the scientific instruments segment reflects an increase in sales from many of our core technologies  particularly x ray and elemental analysis  magnetic resonance  mass spectrometry and molecular spectroscopy products 
the mix of products sold in the scientific instruments segment during reflects increased demand from academic  government and industrial customers 
we attribute the increase in sales of mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance products to spending by academic and government customers  to new product introductions and to stimulus packages implemented by governments of various countries  particularly the us while many european governments have announced their intentions to reduce overall spending  a number of our key european markets  including germany  france and the uk  have announced that research spending will remain stable  or grow in some cases 
based on the announcements from these governments and the european union  we believe that funding for the majority of our products and markets will remain stable  or grow  in most of our key european markets 
the improvement in revenues from our industrial customers reflects an ongoing economic improvement in these end markets 
we remain optimistic that the industrial markets we serve will continue to improve 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue for the year ended december   was million  resulting in a gross profit margin of  compared to cost of product and service revenue of million  resulting in a gross profit margin of  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenue is primarily a function of the higher material costs that result from the higher revenues described above 
however  the increase in costs is also attributable to increases in headcount from our recent acquisitions and increases in headcount to support our current production requirements 
the chemical analysis business also contributed to the increase in cost of revenue because of the costs associated with relocating factories from former varian inc sites to our own facilities 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the strengthening of the euro and swiss franc  also contributed to the increase in cost of revenue because the majority of our production facilities are located in europe 
we recorded million of amortization expense in cost of revenue associated with technology related intangible assets and an additional million representing the difference between the fair value and historical cost of inventories acquired in business combinations and sold in our cost of revenue in also includes million of inventory reserves for the rework of certain specialty magnets that did not meet customer specifications 
in  we recorded million of amortization expense in cost of revenue  million related to the fair value of inventories acquired in recent acquisitions and million related to the specialty magnets that did not meet customer specifications 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenue  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is attributable to increases in headcount from recent acquisitions  primarily the nano surfaces and chemical analysis businesses  and increases in headcount to support planned revenue growth in our existing businesses 
in addition  an increase in new order bookings and revenue in resulted in higher commission 
table of contents expense 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the strengthening of the euro  also negatively impacted our selling  general and administrative expenses because a majority of our selling and marketing employees are located in europe 
research and development our research and development expense for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenue  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses is attributable to increases in headcount from recent acquisitions and increases in headcount and material costs to support future product introductions in our existing businesses 
the increase in research and development expenses is also attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the strengthening of the euro  which negatively impact our research and development expenses because a majority of our research and development is performed in europe 
write off of deferred offering costs in september  we announced plans to sell a minority ownership position in our best subsidiary through an initial public offering of the capital stock of best 
as a result of economic and market factors  the timing of the best initial public offering is uncertain 
although best remains in registration  because of the current uncertainty in the timing of a future offering  we wrote off deferred offering costs totaling million in the third quarter of other charges other charges  net of million recorded in consist of charges recorded entirely in the scientific instruments segment 
the charges recorded in consist of million of acquisition related costs associated with the nano surfaces business  chemical analysis business and other acquisitions completed during the year 
acquisition related costs consist of costs incurred under transition service arrangements we entered into with the sellers of the nano surfaces and chemical analysis businesses and transaction costs  including legal  accounting and other fees 
the transition services agreements expired in and we do not expect these costs to recur 
other charges  net for the year ended december  also includes million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation into the china operations of bruker optics 
other charges  net of million recorded in consist of charges recorded entirely in the scientific instruments segment 
the charges recorded in consist of million of acquisition related costs  million of restructuring charges and a loss of million recorded in connection with the divestiture of a business 
acquisition related costs recorded in relate to our acquisitions of the nano surfaces and chemical analysis businesses and consist of costs incurred under transition service arrangements we entered into with the sellers and transaction costs  including legal  accounting and other fees 
restructuring charges related primarily to severance incurred in connection with closing a production facility in herzogenrath  germany and the loss on the sale of investment is associated with our investment in bruker baltic  ltd  a manufacturing site located in riga  latvia that was engaged in the production of certain components used in our x ray product lines 
the restructuring charges and loss on investment were incurred as part of a broader corporate strategy of reducing costs and consolidating critical production know how in certain key production sites 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net during the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  
table of contents during the year ended december   the major components within interest and other income expense  net  consisted of net interest expense of million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of million 
during the year ended december   the major components within interest and other income expense  net  consisted of net interest expense of million and realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions of million 
the increase in interest expense is primarily a function of higher average outstanding debt balances throughout and  to a lesser degree  an increase in the average interest rates we pay on outstanding borrowings 
losses on foreign currency exchange rates were primarily a function of changes in exchange rates between the euro and the swiss franc against the us dollar 
provision for income taxes the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million compared to an income tax provision of million for the year ended december   representing effective tax rates of and  respectively 
our tax rate may change over time as the amount and mix of income and taxes outside the us changes 
in addition to the amount and mix of income and taxes outside the united states  our income tax provision can be impacted by discrete items of a non recurring nature 
discrete items of this nature resulted in tax expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the discrete items recorded in and relate to additional amounts accrued in connection with ongoing tax audits in germany and switzerland 
the change in our effective tax rate  excluding the increase in reserves for tax audits  relates primarily to reversing certain valuation allowances in the united states 
we were able to release a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in the united states because of deferred tax liabilities arising from the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with the tribology and hplc businesses 
because we maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in the united states  the deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with these acquisitions represents a source of future taxable income that allows us to utilize a portion of the deferred tax assets

this amendment was issued to enhance comparability between entities that report under gaap and international financial reporting standards  or ifrs  and to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions 
table of contents that affect an entity s equity 
the amendment requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two separate but consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are potentially exposed to market risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce these risks 
all 
table of contents transactions related to risk management techniques are authorized and executed pursuant to our policies and procedures 
analytical techniques used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk include market valuations and sensitivity analysis 
impact of foreign currencies we generate a substantial portion of our revenues in international markets  principally germany and other countries in the european union  switzerland and japan  which exposes our operations to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate movement can be positive or negative in any period 
our costs related to sales in foreign currencies are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
in the years ended december  and our revenue by geography was as follows dollars in millions revenue percentage of revenue revenue percentage of revenue united states europe asia pacific rest of world total revenue changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our revenue by approximately in the year ended december  and decreased revenue by in the year ended december  assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries  where the functional currency is the local currency  are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates  or historical rates  as appropriate 
revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year 
adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as a separate component of shareholders equity 
in the years ended december  and  we recorded net gains losses from currency translation adjustments of million and million  respectively 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reported in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
our foreign exchange losses  net were million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
from time to time  we have entered into foreign currency contracts in order to minimize the volatility that fluctuations in exchange rates have on our cash flows related to purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies 
under these arrangements  we agree to purchase a fixed amount of a foreign currency in exchange for a fixed amount of us dollars or other currencies on specified dates  typically with maturities of less than twelve months 
these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting and  accordingly  the instrument is recorded at fair value with the corresponding gains and losses recorded in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents at december  and  we had foreign currency contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had the following notional amounts outstanding under foreign currency contracts in millions buy notional amount in buy currency sell maturity notional amount in us dollars fair value of assets fair value of liabilities december  euro australian dollars january euro us dollars january to october swiss francs us dollars january us dollars mexican pesos january to november based on the contractual maturities of these contracts and exchange rates as of december   we anticipate that these contracts will result in net cash flows of million in at december   assuming all other variables are constant  if the us dollar weakened by  the market value of our foreign currency contracts would increase by approximately million and if the us dollar strengthened by  the market value of our foreign currency contracts would decrease by approximately million 
we will continue to evaluate our currency risks and in the future may utilize foreign currency contracts more frequently as part of a transactional hedging program 
impact of interest rates we regularly invest excess cash in short term investments that are subject to changes in interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal because of our policy of investing in short term financial instruments issued by highly rated financial institutions 
our exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is derived primarily from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rates is to decrease the volatility that changes in interest rates might have on our earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this objective we have entered into an interest rate swap 
a increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would not result in a material change in interest expense because we have determined that the interest rate swap is an effective hedge of the variability of cash flows of the interest payments 
under our interest rate swap arrangement  we pay a fixed interest rate of approximately and receive a variable interest rate based on three month libor through december  the initial notional amount of this interest swap was million and amortizes in proportion to the term debt component of our amended credit agreement 
at december  and  the outstanding notional amount of this swap was million and million  respectively 
based on interest rates as of december   the fair value of the swap was million 
assuming all variables are constant and because the swap will mature on december  the interest rate swap will result in a cash outflow of million in impact of commodity prices we are exposed to certain commodity risks associated with prices for various raw materials 
the prices of copper and certain other raw materials  particularly niobium  used to manufacture superconductors have increased significantly over the last decade 
copper and niobium tin are the main 
table of contents components of low temperature superconductors and continued commodity price increases for copper and niobium  as well as other raw materials  may negatively affect our profitability 
periodically  we enter into commodity forward purchase contracts to minimize the volatility that fluctuations in the price of copper have on our sales of these products 
at december  and december   we had fixed price commodity contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
we will continue to evaluate our commodity risks and may utilize commodity forward purchase contracts more frequently in the future 
inflation we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our business or operating results during any of the periods presented
