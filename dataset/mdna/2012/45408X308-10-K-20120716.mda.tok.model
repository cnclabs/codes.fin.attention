critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
these estimates include  among others  our revenue recognition policies related to the proportional performance and percentage of completion methodologies of revenue recognition of contracts and assessing our goodwill for impairment annually 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results will differ and may differ materially from the estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note to our consolidated financial statements and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
while all accounting policies impact the financial statements  certain policies may be viewed as critical 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
our management believes the policies that fall within this category are the policies on revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  goodwill  and income taxes 
revenue recognition the majority of the revenue recognized for the years ended march  and was derived from the company s subsidiaries  when all of the following criteria have been satisfied 
table of contents revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in government contracting  the company recognizes revenue when a government consultant verifies and certifies an invoice for payment 
revenue from sale of goods is recognized when substantial risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer under the terms of the contract 
for the sale of goods  the timing of the transfer of substantial risks and rewards of ownership is based on the contract terms negotiated with the buyer  eg  fob or cif 
igc considers the guidance provided under staff accounting bulletin sab in determining revenue from sales of goods 
considerations have been given to all four conditions for revenue recognition under that guidance 
the four conditions are contract persuasive evidence of our arrangement with the customers  delivery based on the terms of the contracts  the company assesses whether the underlying goods have been delivered and therefore the risks and rewards of ownership are completely transferred  fixed or determinable price the company enters into contracts where the price for the goods being sold is fixed and not contingent upon other factors 
collection is deemed probable at the time of recognition of revenue  the company makes an assessment of its ability to collect the receivable arising on the sale of the goods and determines that collection is probable 
revenue for any sale is recognized only if all of the four conditions set forth above are met 
the company assesses these criteria at the time of each sale 
in the absence of meeting any of the criteria set out above  the company defers revenue recognition until all of the four conditions are met 
revenue from construction project related activity and contracts for supply commissioning of complex plant and equipment is recognized as follows a cost plus contracts contract revenue is determined by adding the aggregate cost plus proportionate margin as agreed with the customer and expected to be realized 
b fixed price contracts contract revenue is recognized using the percentage completion method and the percentage of completion is determined as a proportion of cost incurred to date to the total estimated contract cost 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs to complete  and profit margins are recognized in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
in many of the fixed price contracts entered into by the company  significant expenses are incurred in the mobilization stage in the early stages of the contract 
the expenses include those that are incurred in the transportation of machinery  erection of heavy machinery  clearing of the campsite  workshop ground cost  overheads  etc 
all such costs are booked to deferred expenses and written off over the period in proportion to revenues earned 
where the modifications of the original contract are such that they effectively add to the existing scope of the contract  the same are treated as a change orders 
on the other hand  where the modifications are such that they change or add an altogether new scope  these are accounted for as a separate new contract 
the company adjusts contract revenue and costs in connection with change orders only when both  the customer and the company with respect to both the scope and invoicing and payment terms  approve them 
in the event of claims in our percentage of completion contracts  the additional contract revenue relating to claims is only accounted after the proper award of the claim by the competent authority 
the contract claims are considered in the percentage of completion only after the proper award of the claim by the competent authority 
full provision is made for any loss in the period in which it is foreseen 
revenue from service related activities and miscellaneous other contracts are recognized when the service is rendered using the proportionate completion method or completed service contract method 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires an entity to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequence attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established and recorded when management determines that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized and therefore  it is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

table of contents in evaluating a tax position for recognition  management evaluates whether it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  based on technical merits of the position 
if the tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the tax position is measured and recognized in the company s financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in management s judgment  is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
as of march  and  there was no significant liability for income tax associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
the issuance by igc of its common stock to hk ironman stockholders in exchange for hk ironman stock  as contemplated by the stock purchase agreement stock purchase agreement between the company  hk ironman  prc ironman and their stockholders  generally will not be a taxable transaction to us holders for us federal income tax purposes 
it is expected that igc and its stockholders will not recognize any gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes 
inventories we provide for inventory obsolescence  excess inventory and inventories with carrying values in excess of market values based on our assessment of the future demands  market conditions and our specific inventory management procedures 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than our estimates  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in all cases inventory is carried at the lower of historical cost or market value 
accounts receivable we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical payment patterns  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of our share of net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition 
goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is disclosed separately 
goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses incurred  if any 
the company adopted the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and others previously referred to as sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which sets forth the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
asc requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be allocated to the reporting unit level  which the company defines as each subsidiary 
asc also prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets upon adoption  but requires that they be tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently as warranted  at the reporting unit level 
as per asc through  the impairment testing of goodwill is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill shall be its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
in asc  a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
the company has determined that igc operates in a single operating segment 
while the ceo reviews the consolidated financial information for the purposes of decisions relating to resource allocation  the cfo  on a need basis  looks at the financial statements of the individual legal entities in india for the limited purpose of consolidation 
given the existence of discrete financial statements at an individual entity level in india  the company believes that each of these entities constitute a separate reporting unit under a single operating segment 
therefore  the first step in the impairment testing for goodwill is the identification of reporting units and the allocation of goodwill to these reporting units 
accordingly  tbl  which is one of the legal entities  is also considered a separate reporting unit and therefore the company believes that the assessment of goodwill impairment at the subsidiary level  which is also a reporting unit  is appropriate 

table of contents the analysis of fair value is based on the estimate of the recoverable value of the underlying assets 
for long lived assets such as land  the company obtains appraisals from independent professional appraisers to determine the recoverable value 
for other assets such as receivables  the recoverable value is determined based on an assessment of the collectability and any potential losses due to default by the counter parties 
unlike goodwill  long lived assets are assessed for impairment only where there are any specific indicators for impairment 
impairment of investment the impairment analysis test is done based on a similar recoverable approach as used in the impairment test for goodwill described above 
the fair value of land is determined based on an independent appraisal of the land held by sricon 
the recoverability of contract claims and other receivables is based on the information available with us with respect to the contract claims awarded in favor of sricon through arbitration orders 
the estimated amount of liability is based on the information available with us with respect of bank debt and other borrowings 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets  with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable 
such circumstances include  though are not limited to  significant or sustained declines in revenues or earnings  future anticipated cash flows  business plans and material adverse changes in the economic climate  such as changes in operating environment  competitive information  impact of change in government policies  etc 
for assets that the company intends to hold for use  if the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows produced by the assets or subsidiary company is less than the carrying amount of the assets  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
for assets the company intends to dispose of by sale  a loss is recognized for the amount by which the estimated fair value less cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on quoted market prices  if available  or other valuation techniques including discounted future net cash flows 
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements changes to us gaap are established by the financial accounting standards board fasb in the form of accounting standards updates asus to the fasb s accounting standards codification 
the company considers the applicability and impact of all asus 
newly issued asus not listed below are expected to have no impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations  because either the asu is not applicable or the impact is expected to be immaterial 
in january  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to the disclosures about an entity s use of fair value measurements 
under these amendments  entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about transfers into and out of the level fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and level fair value determined based on significant other observable inputs classifications  provide separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to the tabular reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the level fair value determined based on significant unobservable inputs classification and provide greater disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities that use fair value measurements 
except for the detailed level roll forward disclosures  the new standard was effective for the company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this accounting standards amendment did not have a material impact on the company s disclosure or consolidated financial results 
the requirement to provide detailed disclosures about the purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity for level fair value measurements is effective for the company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the company s disclosure or consolidated financial results 
in december  the fasb issued a new accounting standard  which requires that step of the goodwill impairment test be performed for reporting units whose carrying value is zero or negative 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s disclosure or consolidated financial results 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance clarifying some of the disclosure requirements related to business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
specifically  the guidance states that  if comparative financial statements are presented  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
additionally  the new standard expands the supplemental pro forma disclosure required by the authoritative guidance to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this guidance became effective january  our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s disclosure or consolidated financial results 
however  it may result in additional disclosures in the event that we enter into a business combination that is material on either an individual or a consolidated basis 

table of contents in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
this update defines fair value  clarifies a framework to measure fair value and requires specific disclosures of fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after january  and is required to be applied retrospectively 
the company does not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued asu  which is now part of asc presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the standard does not change the items  which must be reported in other comprehensive income 
these provisions are to be applied retrospectively and will be effective for us as of january  because this guidance impacts presentation only  it will have no effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting disclosure requirements about the nature and exposure of offsetting arrangements related to financial and derivative instruments 
the requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after january   which for us is the fiscal ending march the requirements will not impact our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that permits companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired before performing the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
the guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this standard will not impact our financial results 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march the following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march  and year ended march  as restated change percentage revenues cost of revenues revenues less cost of revenues excluding depreciation selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation operating income loss interest and other financial expenses interest income other income loss on dilution of stake in sricon impairment loss goodwill impairment loss investment equity in earnings of affiliates income before income taxes and minority interest income taxes benefit expense income after income taxes 
table of contents revenue total revenue is million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the year ended march   an increase by 
the iron ore mines in india were shut down for all of fiscal and fiscal the limited revenue reported is from trading of ore within india 
the government of india has indicated that it will reopen the mines in fiscal and possibly by year end we have shut the plants in china until processes  reporting  new management  and compliance tracking are put in place 
therefore there was no revenue from the chinese plants in the months of january through march we expect the integration of ironman to be completed in fiscal second quarter of once integration is completed under new management we will reopen the plants 
once the mines in india open  we will be in a position to export low grade ore from india to china for further beneficiation at our plants in linxi 
cost of revenue cost of revenue is exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
it consists primarily of compensation and related fringe benefits for project related personnel  department management  and all other dedicated project related costs and indirect costs 
cost of revenue for the year ended march  increased by million  compared to the year ended march  this increase is primarily due to revaluation of prc ironman inventory on account of decrease in market price of iron ore in china and globally 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue has increased from in the previous year to in the current year 
this increase is on account of the significant increase in the raw material prices in the current year in igc mpl and revaluation of inventory at prc ironman 
revenues less cost of revenue the difference between our revenues and cost of revenues decreased by million or to million for the year ended march  as compared to million for the year ended march  the principal reason for the decrease in the same during the year ended march  as compared to the previous year was due to increase in cost of revenue during the year as explained above 
as a percentage of revenue  the difference between revenue and cost of revenue was and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
we had some fixed costs  which did not reduce proportionately leading to a decline in our gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses these consist primarily of employee related expenses  professional fees  other corporate expenses  allocated overhead and provisions and write offs relating to doubtful and bad debts and advances 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended march  compared million for the year ended march  the expenses as a proportion of revenue during the current year were as compared to in the previous year 
the decrease as compared to previous year is due to provision relating to the receivable from one of the investee companies sricon in the previous year 
one of the subsidiaries of the company tbl had advanced a loan to sricon to fund some of the operations 
however due to certain management disputes  the company has not recovered the receivable even though the same was due 
the company intends to pursue the collection of this receivable through appropriate legal recourse in india 
however  due to the uncertainty in the timing and the quantum of collection  the company in fiscal had provided a reserve for this receivable in the amount of million 
write off of certain bad debts that were considered to be irrecoverable amounting to million in previous year 
excluding the impact of the above write offs in previous year  the selling  general  and administrative expenses as a proportion of revenue was in the current year as compared to in the previous year 
the increase in the current year is due mainly to one time expenses related to the acquisition of ironman 
overall in fiscal  the company took steps to reduce and realign its overheads in usa  india and china 
depreciation the depreciation expense was million in as compared to million in the increase is mainly on account of consolidation of h f ironman 
income from operations loss from operations reduced from million for the year ended march  to a loss of million for the year ended march   which is a decrease of million in losses 

table of contents interest and other financial expense the interest expense for the year ended march  was million as compared to million for the year ended march  the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to repayment of notes 
during fiscal  not including ironman  the company paid off about  of short term borrowing  notes payable and trade payable  including one note for which the company was paying an interest rate of 
cost of capital is still a staggering expense for us 
in fiscal  we focused on reducing the cost of capital by eliminating loans that carry very high interest rates and are a drag on earnings 
in fiscal  we paid  in interest and we have eliminated about  in interest  which will manifest in fiscal interest income the interest income for the year ended march  was million as compared to million for the year ended march  the income was derived mostly from cash that is held as deposits 
impairment loss investment for the year ended march   the company again conducted an impairment test of its investment in sricon 
based on a revaluation of the assets including the real estate owned by sricon  the company has determined that a further impairment loss amounting to million relating to the investment in sricon is required 
the carrying value of the investment in sricon is accordingly million as at march  the carrying value as at march  approximates the recoverable assessed value as determined as on that date 
we are in the process of settling our dispute with sricon and expect to eliminate our ownership in sricon in exchange for property in nagpur 
other income other income primarily consists of foreign exchange gain loss arising from the restatement of the inter company receivables  denominated in indian rupees  regarding payables to igc 
further during the current year  the company has written back liabilities relating purchase consideration payable to the promoters of h f ironman 
the purchase consideration of usd million relating to the acquisition of ironman was linked to certain committed conditions to be completed before january  these conditions were not consummated and accordingly  the company has written back the liability related to this payment 
income tax expense we had an income tax expense of million for the year ended march  as compared to million for the year ended march  the income tax expense for the previous year was primarily on account of losses incurred in the previous year  which we believed would be offset against taxable profits in the future years due to the execution of the substantial orders received from china 
during the previous year  considering the continued ban on import of low grade iron ore by china and the shut down on mining and exports from karnataka  the company believed that the timing of the execution of the orders couldn t be projected 
therefore  from the perspective of prudence the company provided a valuation on the entire deferred tax asset balance during the previous year resulting in the substantial income tax expense 
we however continue to expect to perform and deliver ore to our customers and earn sufficient taxable income to utilize all the deferred tax assets that we have recorded 
we have not relied on any specific tax planning strategies in the recognition of the deferred tax assets 
net loss the company had a loss of million for the year ended march  as compared to a loss of million for the year ended march this reduction in loss was driven primarily by lesser write offs of assets  which in turn shows the stability of receivables in the current year 
we have worked very hard in fiscal to a reduce overheads  b reduce our cost of capital by eliminating high interest loans  c realigning the business to focus on the iron ore business  d reach an agreement with sricon and e completing the acquisition of ironman 
we believe that our over all cash expenses related to overheads and interest have been reduced dramatically in preparation for the opening of mines in india and restarting the mines in china 
balance sheet explanations goodwill the increase in goodwill between fiscal and is attributed to the goodwill from the ironman acquisition 
liabilities the company eliminated  in short term borrowings between fiscal and fiscal the company also eliminated  in trade payables and  in notes payable for a total of  the company s non current liabilities increased from  to  between fiscal and the increase is primarily due to  of incentive based compensation that is related to the acquisition of ironman 
non controlling interest the non controlling interest is attributed to the fact that we own of tbl and that hk ironman owns of prc ironman 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources this liquidity and capital resources discussion compares the consolidated company results for the years ended march  and as the iron ore mines in india were closed through fiscal  we focused on acquisitions and strengthening our presence in india and china with respect to iron ore 
the acquisition of ironman in the third quarter of fiscal is expected to generate positive cash inflow from operations in fiscal our future liquidity needs will depend on  among other factors  stability of iron ore prices  demand for iron ore  construction costs  interest rates  and a continued increase in infrastructure in india and china 
we believe that our current cash balances  anticipated operating cash flow in fiscal  and cash from claims are adequate to sustain the company  but not to fuel growth 
the company has access to about inr million million at an exchange rate of inr to usd in funds that have been deposited by the national highway authority of india nhai with the high court in delhi against an arbitration award that was won by tbl 
the amount deposited pursuant to an order by the judge of the high court  includes principal of the award plus interest 
the company is allowed to access the amount deposited with the court immediately  but needs to make arrangements to provide a letter of credit to the high court 
the company is working on arranging the letter of credit  which is routine  and expects to be able access the full million 
on our balance sheet  our accounts receivables only shows the principal of the award and not the interest as the company s policy has been not to book any of the interest mainly because the interest is sometimes used as a negotiating tool for speeding up recovery 
however  in this case we will have access to both the principal and interest pursuant to the ruling of the high court 
this amount of cash that is available to the company plus the reduction in g a and the elimination of interest payable is why the company believes it has access to enough capital to sustain the company over the next months 
on our balance sheet  in addition to the existing cash balances  we have about million in receivables and claims 
we have and continue to take measures to constrain costs until we have visibility into increased liquidity and the opening of the mines in india 
we continue to explore other funding sources including negotiated settlement of accounts receivable  settlement of claims  bank lines  equity  convertible debentures and debt 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to access additional credit facilities 
our strategy is to develop businesses that have a very short receivable cycle like the export of ore to china and to aggressively collect our outstanding receivables and claims 
purchasers of our common stock in our at the market atm offering after july  and the purchasers of our common stock and warrants in our december offering had rescission rights with respect to such purchases but such rights have expired 
repatriation of funds from india requires obtaining clearances from the reserve bank of india rbi 
this process can take several months to complete 
we have compiled all the necessary information for the application  including obtaining the foreign inward remittance certificates firc from all our banks  for all our indian subsidiaries  and initiated the process of applying to the rbi for permission 
we have retained an indian foreign exchange expert to help with the process 
once we obtain the clearances from the rbi  repatriating funds from india will become significantly easier 
as reported on a current report on form k filed by the company on april   the company retired a note  including interest and penalties  in the amount of 
the company projects a reduction in annual interest costs from this loan by about  the company paid off the loan with  shares of newly issued common stock 
the company anticipates that the elimination of this expense will be one factor in bringing the company back to profitability in its current fiscal year  which began april  we calculated the wvap to require the payment of  shares to the noteholder 
however  the noteholder is claiming that it is entitled to  shares  which claim we intend to oppose vigorously 
there has been no legal action filed in connection with this claim 
not including any liability that was settled by ironman  the company retired  in addition to the loan of  about  in short term borrowings and  in trade payables for a total of  in loans and liability 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchanges  commodity prices  equity prices  and other market driven rates or prices 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather  indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
customer risk the company s customers are the indian government  state government  private companies  indian government owned companies and chinese steel mills and iron ore traders 
therefore  our business requires that we continue to maintain a pre qualified status with our clients so we are not disqualified from bidding on future work 
the loss of a significant client may have an adverse effect on the company 
disqualification can occur if  for example  we run out of capital to finish contracts that we have undertaken 
commodity prices and vendor risk the company is affected by the availability  cost and quality of raw materials including cement  asphalt  steel  rock aggregate  iron ore and fuel 
the prices and supply of raw materials and fuel depend on factors beyond the control of the company  including general economic conditions  competition  production levels  transportation costs and import duties 
the company typically builds contingencies into the contracts  including indexing key commodity prices into escalation clauses 
however  drastic changes in the global markets for raw materials and fuels could affect our vendors  which may create disruptions in delivery schedules that could affect our ability to execute contracts in a timely manner 
we are taking steps to mitigate some of this risk by attempting to control the supply and quality of raw materials 
we do not currently hedge commodity prices on capital markets  which exposes the company to risks related to high prices 
labor risk the building boom in india and the middle east india  pakistan and bangladesh export labor to the middle east had created pressure on the availability of skilled labor like welders  equipment operators  etc 
this has recently changed with the shortage of financial liquidity and falling oil prices 
we see limited labor risk in india or in china 
compliance  legal and operational risks we operate under regulatory and legal obligations imposed by the indian and chinese governments and us securities regulators 
those obligations relate  among other things  to the company s financial reporting  trading activities  capital requirements and the supervision of its employees 
for example  we file our financial statements in four countries under four different gaap standards 
failure to fulfill legal or regulatory obligations can lead to fines  censure or disqualification of management and or staff and other measures that could have negative consequences for our activities and financial performance 
we are mitigating this risk by hiring local consultants and staff who can manage the compliance in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
however  the cost of compliance in various jurisdictions could have a negative impact on our future earnings 
interest rate risk the infrastructure development industry is one in which leverage plays a large role 
a typical contract requires that we furnish an earnest money deposit  a performance guaranty and the ability to discount letters of credit
