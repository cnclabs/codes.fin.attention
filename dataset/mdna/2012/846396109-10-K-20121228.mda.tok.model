competition medical 
in the medical market segment  we face significant competition for sales of the three main categories of therapeutic support surfaces 
these are powered air therapy support surfaces  non powered air therapy support surfaces and therapeutic foam support surfaces 
competition in the therapeutic support surface market is based on a variety of factors including product performance  ease of use  patient safety features  price and durability 
customers often select a product based on these criteria after conducting a formal clinical evaluation 
chief competitors include hill rom holdings hill rom  kinetic concepts  invacare corporation  joerns healthcare  and medline industries 
these competitors use combinations of their own sales representatives and manufacturer s representatives to sell nationwide directly to hospitals  distributors  long term care facilities and original equipment manufacturers 
many of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than span america 
we believe our competitive advantages in the medical segment include innovative and patented product designs  product quality  manufacturing capabilities  distribution relationships  rapid delivery capabilities and responsiveness to customer requirements 
many smaller national and regional players also participate in this segment  with varying market segments and resources 
competition within the foam mattress overlay and patient positioner categories is primarily based on price  selection and delivery 
we believe that span america is one of the largest nationwide suppliers of mattress overlays and patient positioners to the us health care market 
our primary competitors in these categories include joerns healthcare and covidien plc 
span medical products canada 
created through the december acquisition of mc healthcare products in beamsville  ontario canada  this division faces competition for sales in the long term care market both from manufacturers and national distributors of long term care beds and related furniture 
price as well as product features and performance  quality  delivery and brand recognition all play a part in selection of a particular product 
additionally  the ability to offer packages that include a variety of products as well as financing can also influence the buying decision 
the purchase decision may also be based on a mixture of the preceding factors 
several of the primary competitors in the long term care market for beds and furniture are the same as those in the support surfaces segment 
these include joerns healthcare  invacare corporation  hill rom and medline 
another major player is gf health products graham field 
these competitors are larger than span medical products canada and use their own sales forces  manufacturer s representatives  distributors or a combination to sell their products to long term care facilities 
while the acquired mc healthcare operation has historically been smaller than its major competitors  the product line has a strong reputation for high quality  innovative products combined with excellent customer service 
custom products 
in the custom products segment  we routinely encounter significant competition for our mattress pad and pillow products 
the competition is principally based on price  which is largely determined by foam density and thickness 
however  competition also exists due to variations in product design and packaging 
there are presently a number of companies with the manufacturing capability to produce similar bedding products 
our primary competitors in this market are sleep innovations  inc  er carpenter company and sinomax  inc  most of which are larger and have greater resources than span america 
we also have a number of competitors in the market for our industrial products  including hibco plastics  cellofoam north america  inc  ufp technologies  inc 
and foam tech 
these competitors are larger and have greater resources than span america  including large  nationwide sales forces 
the competition for industrial foam products is largely based on price 
in many instances  however  design  product quality and delivery capabilities are also important 
we believe that our competitive advantages in the custom products segment include our distribution relationship with louisville bedding company  innovative product designs  manufacturing and foam fabrication capabilities  low cost manufacturing processes and responsiveness to customer requirements 
during recent years  we have encountered increasing competition in the consumer bedding market from visco foam products manufactured both in the united states and china 
visco foam  also known as visco elastic foam or memory foam  has greater density and different properties than traditional polyurethane foam products 
it responds to body temperature  conforms to the shape of the body  and generally has slower recovery time compared with traditional polyurethane foam 
memory foam is also significantly more expensive than traditional foam and is more difficult to handle and fabricate 
because memory foam is more difficult to cut and shape than traditional foam  it is more difficult for us to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
consequently  the memory foam mattress pads currently on the market tend to be somewhat undifferentiated without unique surface designs 
in addition  since memory foam is significantly more expensive and more dense than traditional foam  it is more cost effective for overseas competitors from china for example to ship the products into the us market 
this is generally because retail prices of memory foam products are significantly higher than comparable traditional foam products  which generates much higher revenue per square foot of retail shelf space and lowers shipping costs as a percent of sales value 
major customers we have an agreement with louisville bedding company to distribute our consumer foam products 
sales to louisville bedding during fiscal made up approximately of our total net sales and approximately of sales in the custom products segment 
see industry segment data medical distributor and private label manufacturing relationships above and note major customers and note operations and industry segments and geographical areas in the notes to consolidated financial statements below for more information on major customers 
the loss of any of these major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
seasonal trends seasonal trends within our medical segment are generally not material to our operations 
however  we periodically have significant seasonal fluctuations within our custom products segment 
the custom products segment consists of our consumer and industrial product lines 
we occasionally experience significant fluctuations within our consumer bedding products due to seasonal promotions with our retail customers 
historically  these consumer promotions have commonly occurred during our first and fourth fiscal quarters  ending in december and september  respectively 
the consumer products promotions are arranged on a case by case basis with our retail customers and our marketing partner  louisville bedding company 
consequently  it is possible to have several promotions within a fiscal year or none at all  depending on market and competitive conditions 
we have not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in our industrial product line 
patents and trademarks span america holds united states patents and foreign patents relating to various components of our therapeutic support surfaces and seating products for the medical segment 
we have also filed additional patent applications 
we believe that these patents are important to our business 
however  while we have a number of products covered by patents  there are competitive alternatives available  sales of which are not restricted by our patents 
therefore  we do not rely solely on our patents to maintain our competitive position in our various markets 
our principal patents include those on our pressureguard and seating products 
the pressureguard patents have remaining lives ranging from two to nine years with additional patents pending 
the seating patents have remaining lives ranging from one to seven years 
we hold federally registered trademarks and foreign trademark registrations  including span america  span aids  geo matt  geo mattress  pressureguard  and isch dish  in the medical and consumer segments 
other federal registration applications are presently pending 
we believe that these trademarks are readily identifiable in their respective markets and add value to our product lines 
raw materials and backlog approximately of our raw materials consist of polyurethane foam  nylon vinyl mattress covers and tubes  motors  pneumatic pumps  blowers  bed actuators  steel and metal stampings 
in addition  we use corrugated shipping containers  polyethylene plastic packaging material and hook and loop fasteners 
we believe that our basic raw materials are in adequate supply and are available from many suppliers at competitive prices 
see item a 
risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on price increases for polyurethane foam 
as of september   we had unshipped or open orders of approximately million  which represented a increase as compared to our open orders of million at fiscal year end the majority of the open orders at both fiscal year ends and were from a consumer customer for seasonal promotional items that were shipped within days of year end 
open orders at september  include approximately  of orders for span canada which we did not own at october  we expect to fill all orders open as of september  in the fiscal year 
employees we had full time employees as of september  in the united states and in canada 
of these employees  were manufacturing personnel 
span america is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement in the united states and has never experienced an interruption or curtailment of operations due to labor controversy 
on december   we acquired substantially all of the assets of mc healthcare  located in beamsville  ontario 
the manufacturing employees of this facility employees at september  are members of the sheet metal workers international association  local union the union  whose employment is governed by a collective agreement with the union that was assumed by operation of canadian labor law by our new canadian subsidiary in connection with the asset acquisition 
this collective agreement expired by its terms on october  a new collective agreement has been negotiated and ratified by a vote of the union members 
there has been no work interruption or curtailment of operations as a result of the negotiations on the new agreement 
the new collective agreement is currently being finalized  and we believe its terms are at least as favorable as those in the previous agreement 
we do not anticipate any material adverse change in our mchp operations as a result of the new collective agreement 
we expect the new agreement to be finalized and signed during january mchp had total employees on september  we believe that our relations with our employees are good in both the united state and canada 
supervision and regulation the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and regulations issued or proposed thereunder  provide for regulation by the fda of the marketing  manufacture  labeling  packaging and distribution of medical devices  including our products 
these regulations require  among other things  that medical device manufacturers register with the fda  list devices manufactured by them  and file various reports 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with good manufacturing practices as required by the fda and state regulatory authorities 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations and do not anticipate having to make any material expenditures as a result of fda or other regulatory requirements 
we are certified as an iso and iso supplier for our pressureguard mattress products from our greenville  south carolina plant 
iso the international organization for standardization is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies dealing with quality system requirements that can be used by a supplier to demonstrate its capability and for the assessment of the capability of a supplier by external parties 
compliance with iso standard is required by health canada for all class ii medical devices sold there 
all of our powered therapeutic support surfaces for the health care market are considered class ii medical devices 
the certification is subject to reassessment at six month intervals 
we have maintained our certification based on the results of iso audits conducted during fiscal year the canadian food and drugs act  and the medical devices regulations issued thereunder  provide for regulation by health canada of the manufacture  labeling  packaging  distribution  sale and advertisement of medical devices  including the bed frames made through span medical products canada inc  span america s wholly owned subsidiary  which are considered class i medical devices 
the medical devices regulations require  among other things  that class i medical device manufacturers who sell medical devices hold a medical device establishment license and file various reports 
in addition  manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with device safety and effectiveness requirements as required by the medical devices regulations and health canada 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations and do not anticipate having to make any material expenditures as a result of health canada or other regulatory requirements 
environmental matters our manufacturing operations in the us and canada are subject to various government regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations 
we do not anticipate that continued compliance will have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
item a 
risk factors the loss of a key distributor or customer in the company s medical or custom products segments could cause a rapid and significant sales decline  which would likely result in a material decline in earnings 
many of our medical products are sold through large national distributors in the united states and canada 
we do not maintain long term distribution agreements with most of these distributors 
instead  we supply them based on purchase orders that are issued by the customers on a daily or weekly basis 
with minimal notice  either party can generally end these supplier customer relationships 
consequently  if a large customer or distributor decided to discontinue purchasing our products  our sales and earnings could quickly decline 
our largest customers in the medical segment are mckesson medical surgical and cardinal health  which accounted for and  respectively  of sales in the medical segment in fiscal in addition  all of our consumer foam products are sold through our exclusive distributor  louisville bedding company  under a marketing and distribution agreement that expires in december the agreement automatically renews for successive three year terms unless either party provides notice of its intent not to renew at least days prior to the expiration date 
sales to louisville bedding company accounted for of sales for the company in fiscal and of sales in the custom products segment 
for more information on major customers and information on our business segments  see the discussions under item business major customers  item business industry segment data medical distributor and private label manufacturing relationships  item business industry segment data custom products  note major customers and note operations and industry segments and geographic areas in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the current weakness in the us economy combined with uncertainties about healthcare reform and tax policy could cause our sales to decline  which in turn could have a material negative effect on our earnings 
the largest volume product lines within our medical segment are our lines of therapeutic support surfaces  which consist of our pressureguard and geo mattress products as well as our private label support surfaces 
these products are generally considered by us and our customers to be capital purchase items instead of consumable supplies 
we believe that purchases of these capital goods are more easily postponed during business downturns than purchases of consumables 
consequently  sales of our support surfaces and bed frames are likely to be more sensitive to general economic weakness than other medical product lines in our business 
also  uncertainties about tax policy and the full implementation of healthcare reform could cause our customers to delay  reduce or cancel capital expenditure plans  which could slow sales particularly within our support surface and bed frame product lines 
therapeutic support surface sales made up of total company sales during fiscal and increased during the year compared with fiscal sales of bed frames  which resulted from the mc healthcare acquisition  made up of total company sales during fiscal sales of therapeutic support surfaces and bed frames could decline if the economy remains weak or worsens or if healthcare reform and changes in tax policy result in reduced demand from our customers 
in addition  our industrial products are sold primarily to the automotive  packaging and water sports industries  as well as various other manufacturers 
our industrial business has historically been more affected by general economic trends than other span america product lines 
therefore an economic downturn is likely to have a greater effect on sales of industrial products than on other product lines in our business 
sales of industrial products could decline if the economy remains weak or worsens 
since many of our operating costs are fixed within a normal monthly range of sales and production activity  sales declines could result in proportionally greater declines in earnings performance 
we would attempt to reduce expenses in response to lower sales levels  but we cannot give assurance that we would be able to fully offset the effect of a decline in sales volume 
as a result our business could be materially adversely affected by an economic downturn or continuing weakness of the economy 
current weaknesses or downturns in the us and global economies could also have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of one or more of our key customers or distributors or on several customers and distributors that  in the aggregate  account for a material portion of our sales 
such an adverse effect on our customers or distributors could  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our own business and or financial condition as a result of a loss or material reduction in our sales to such customers or distributors and also  potentially  our inability to collect material accounts receivable which accounts receivable are unsecured owed to us by such customers or distributors if they become unable to pay their debts 
our acquisition of mc healthcare in december introduces several new risks for the company  including those related to business integration  international operations  foreign exchange and impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
although we have no current plans to make significant changes to the operations of mc healthcare  our efforts to integrate the various operational processes of span america and mc healthcare could result in temporary business disruptions or inefficiencies 
in addition  the change in ownership could precipitate changes in mc healthcare s relationships with key customers or suppliers 
these events could have a negative effect on our earnings performance 
while we believe that the mc healthcare acquisition will prove to be successful and improve our financial performance  we cannot guarantee that the acquisition will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
there are risks inherent with any acquisition such as retaining key employees and the risk that unexpected liabilities may arise from the mc healthcare acquisition 
mc healthcare s manufacturing facility is located in beamsville  ontario  canada 
we are leasing the current facility under a five year lease agreement as described elsewhere in this report 
as a result  we will be operating in a foreign country under different laws  regulations and customs  all of which will add potential new risks and costs to the company 
prior to the acquisition  span america had no material foreign exchange risk 
as a result of the acquisition  we now manufacture and sell products in the us and canada 
revenues and costs are incurred in both us and canadian dollars 
we are therefore subject to realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency translation activities related to our operations 
these foreign exchange gains or losses could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the mc healthcare acquisition resulted in additional goodwill of approximately million 
this goodwill will be evaluated at least annually for possible impairment 
if the goodwill became impaired and not recoverable  it could result in a material non cash charge to earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our medical business could lose sales volume or could have a lower sales growth rate as a result of government reimbursement changes in the medical market 
a number of our medical products are eligible for reimbursement by medicare 
we receive no direct reimbursements from medicare  but our customers often submit reimbursement requests to medicare 
for example  we sell therapeutic support surfaces to home health care dealers who in turn rent these products to patients 
medicare reimburses the dealers for some or all of the patient s rental cost 
if medicare reimbursement rates are reduced  the demand for our medical products that are covered by medicare could decrease  depending on the size of the rate reduction and could have a material adverse impact on our earnings 
our earnings could be negatively affected by raw material cost increases that we are unable to recover through sales price increases 
the cost of polyurethane foam represented approximately of our total cost of goods sold in fiscal an increase in foam raw material costs that we are not able to pass through to our customers by increasing prices could have a significant negative effect on our profitability 
besides polyurethane foam  our other major raw material categories include therapeutic support surface covers made of various water proof fabrics  vinyl bags  vinyl air cylinders  electronic components for beds and support surfaces  motors  pneumatic pumps  blowers  corrugated boxes  bed actuators  steel and metal stampings 
raw materials are our single largest cost category  representing approximately of our total cost of goods sold in fiscal cost increases in these raw materials could have a significant adverse effect on earnings if we are unable to recover the higher costs through sales price increases or operating expense reductions 
changes in applicable laws or increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions  as a result of concern over climate change  may result in increased raw material or other costs  which would negatively affect our profitability 
our sales volume could decline as a result of competition from low cost foreign imports 
during the last several years  we have experienced increased competition in our medical and custom products segments from low cost foreign imports 
in the medical segment  the number of low cost  imported mattress products has increased  but it has not yet had a significant impact on our medical business 
we believe that we have potentially greater exposure to low cost imports in our consumer bedding product lines because those products have more commodity like characteristics than our medical products 
also  our customers  which are generally national retailers  are more likely to change suppliers to buy lower cost products 
therefore  we could lose significant sales volume in our consumer bedding business and some portion of our medical sales volume if we are unable to compete effectively with low cost imports 
certain of our medical products are classified as medical devices and are regulated by the fda 
these regulations require  among other things  that medical device manufacturers register with the fda  list devices manufactured by them  and file various reports 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with good manufacturing practices as required by the fda and state regulatory authorities 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations  the existence of the regulations creates the risk of a product recall and related expenses as well as the risk of additional expenses required to meet new regulatory requirements 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties we own our principal office and manufacturing facility  which is located in greenville  south carolina 
this facility contains approximately  square feet used by the medical and custom products segments and is located on a acre site 
we believe that our current manufacturing and storage space is adequate to support our operations during the next several years  depending on sales growth rates 
we also lease  square feet of warehouse space in salt lake city  utah for use as a distribution center for our medical products segment 
we lease this facility on a month by month basis at a rate of  per month 
we consider the south carolina and utah facilities to be suitable and adequate for their intended purposes 
in connection with our acquisition of mc healthcare on december   we signed a year commitment to lease the  square foot manufacturing and showroom facility in beamsville  ontario  canada from mc healthcare s former parent corporation  thompson contract supply company limited  at  per year with an option to buy the property or continue the lease for an additional five years 
we consider the beamsville  ontario facilities suitable and adequate for the conduct of the business acquired from mc healthcare  which is part of our medical products segment 
item legal proceedings from time to time we are a party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
we believe that as a result of legal defenses and insurance arrangements with parties believed to be financially capable  there currently are no proceedings threatened or pending against us that  if determined adversely  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

we sell the industrial product line directly to our customers through our own sales force instead of using distributors 
results of operations fiscal vs 
summary fiscal net sales increased to million compared with million in fiscal and benefited from growth in the medical and custom products segments and from the acquisition of mc healthcare 
the million increase in sales included organic growth of million and million from the mc healthcare acquisition as further described below 
net income for fiscal rose to million  or per diluted share  an increase of from million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the earnings increase for fiscal was the result of higher overall sales volume  the mc healthcare acquisition and a lower rate of increase in sg a expenses compared with the prior year 
on december   we acquired substantially all the assets of mc healthcare products inc mc healthcare or mchp 
mchp  located in beamsville  ontario  canada  was a privately owned manufacturer and marketer of medical bed frames and related products for the long term care market 
for their pre acquisition fiscal year ended july   mchp reported sales of cdn million and operating profit of cdn  which included non recurring and owner related expenses of cdn million and cdn  in depreciation and amortization 
the total purchase price for the mchp assets was approximately million  which included million in cash and  shares of span america common stock paid at closing  plus  paid in january for the final working capital adjustment 
the  shares of span america common stock were valued at million based on the average of the high and low sales prices on december  we funded the asset acquisition through a combination of cash on hand  proceeds from the liquidation of our securities available for sale and million from our revolving credit facility 
the tangible assets purchased consisted primarily of accounts receivable  inventory and manufacturing equipment 
liabilities assumed consisted of accounts payable and accruals incurred in the ordinary course of business 
the transaction resulted in goodwill of approximately million and other intangible assets of approximately million 
span america is operating mchp under the registered business name mc healthcare products  a division of span medical products canada inc which we refer to as span canada  which is a newly formed british columbia corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of span america 
for reporting and management purposes  financial results for mchp became part of our existing medical segment as of the acquisition date  december  sales medical segment sales rose to million in fiscal compared with sales of million in fiscal mc healthcare is included in the medical segment and accounted for of the medical segment sales growth compared with the prior fiscal year 
the remaining growth in medical sales was primarily from our lines of therapeutic support surfaces 
therapeutic support surfaces are our largest medical product line  making up of our medical segment sales in fiscal and in fiscal we sell these products to long term care facilities  home care dealers and acute care hospitals throughout the united states and canada 
sales of therapeutic support surfaces increased in fiscal as a result of higher sales of our pressureguard custom care support surfaces launched in fiscal and our broad line of geomattress support surfaces 
performance in our other medical product lines included a increase in sales of the risk manager bedside safety mat 
selan skin care sales increased  while sales of seating products increased during the same period 
sales of our span aids patient positioners decreased by during fiscal compared with fiscal  and sales of mattress overlays declined during fiscal medical sales accounted for of total net sales in fiscal year and in fiscal year our custom products segment consists of bedding products for the consumer market and specialty foam products for the industrial market 
sales in the custom products segment increased in fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal within this segment  consumer sales rose to million compared with million in fiscal the majority of sales growth in the custom products segment was due to consumer bedding sales that resulted from several limited time promotions with our retail customers during fiscal the remaining portion of the increase came from higher demand from existing customers related to product enhancements as well as the addition of new customers 
our internet consumer bedding sales also continued to grow  increasing during fiscal to approximately  compared with fiscal all of our consumer products are sold through our marketing and distribution partner  louisville bedding company 
industrial sales  which make up the other part of the custom products segment  increased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal this increase was due to higher demand primarily from customers in the specialty packaging and automotive industries 
gross profit our gross profit increased by during fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the asset acquisition of mchp and two special sales promotions of our consumer products in the retail market 
gross margin decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was caused by higher foam raw material prices in both the medical and custom products segments  a shift in sales mix toward the lower margin custom products segment and a less profitable sales mix within the medical segment 
sales in the custom products segment made up of total net sales in fiscal year compared with in fiscal selling  research development and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses increased  to million of net sales in fiscal compared with million of net sales in fiscal the increase occurred in the medical segment and was primarily the result of the acquisition of mc healthcare and higher commission and freight expense as a result of the growth in sales volume 
total research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the increase was the result of new product development efforts for both mc healthcare and span america s base medical business 
we incur almost all of our research and development expenses in the medical segment for the development of new products  new features of existing products and design improvements 
our r d expenses will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year  depending on the nature of the development projects being pursued 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the expense increase during fiscal resulted primarily from the mc healthcare acquisition and higher incentive compensation expenses in fiscal mchp acquisition related expenses included  of intangibles amortization expense and  
per diluted share after taxes in non recurring  acquisition transaction costs for the fiscal year partially offsetting these increases were income of  in fiscal from the cash value of life insurance compared with  in fiscal in spite of the increases in expense levels  total selling  r d and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales to in fiscal compared with in fiscal because total revenues grew at a faster rate than expenses during this period 
operating income operating income increased in fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal in the medical segment  operating income for fiscal increased by to million compared with million in fiscal operating income in the custom products segment increased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase in operating income for the year was the result of higher sales volume in both the medical and custom products segments as a result of the mchp asset acquisition and two special  limited time consumer products promotions 
non operating income and expenses we incurred net non operating expense of  in fiscal compared with net non operating income of  in fiscal the  change from income to expense was caused by a  reduction in investment income  the addition of  in interest expense and a foreign currency exchange loss of  related to the december asset acquisition of mc healthcare 
we incurred no interest expense in fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion about our revolving credit facility and foreign currency exchange below for more information 
net income and dividends net income for fiscal rose to million  or per diluted share  an increase of from million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the earnings increase for fiscal was the result of higher overall sales volume  the mc healthcare acquisition and a lower rate of increase in sg a expenses compared with the prior year 
the mc healthcare acquisition contributed after tax income of  or per diluted share  from the closing date of december   through fiscal year end and accounted for approximately of the total increase in net income for fiscal compared with the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  we paid dividends of million  or of net income for the year 
this amount consisted of two quarterly dividends of per share and two quarterly dividends of per share 
in november  the board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share and a regular quarterly cash dividend of cents per share 
the special dividend and regular quarterly dividend were paid on december   to shareholders of record on november  this was our nd consecutive quarterly dividend and our fourth special cash dividend payment 
results of operations fiscal vs 
summary total sales in fiscal were million compared with million in fiscal medical sales decreased to million due primarily to lower sales of therapeutic support surfaces 
custom products sales for fiscal increased compared with fiscal year to million due to higher sales of consumer bedding products 
compared with fiscal year  net income for fiscal year declined to million  or per diluted share  because of lower sales volume in the medical segment  a less profitable sales mix within our medical segment and our consumer product lines  increased raw material costs and higher administrative expenses 
sales total sales in our core medical business decreased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the decline was due to lower sales of therapeutic support surfaces  which were down by to million during fiscal  compared with million in fiscal therapeutic support surfaces are our largest medical product line  making up of our medical segment sales in fiscal and in fiscal sales of therapeutic support surfaces declined in fiscal as a result of lower sales of our pressureguard apm powered product line primarily due to weak economic conditions earlier in the fiscal year 
we experienced sales growth from pressureguard easy air products  our non powered geo mattress product line and the newly launched pressureguard custom care support surfaces that partially offset the declines from other support surface product lines 
performance in our other medical product lines included a increase in sales of the risk manager bedside safety mat  which we introduced in fiscal sales of our span aids patient positioners increased by during fiscal compared with fiscal selan skin care sales declined as did sales of seating products 
sales of mattress overlays declined during fiscal medical sales accounted for of total net sales in fiscal year and in fiscal year our custom products segment consists of bedding products for the consumer market and specialty foam products for the industrial market 
sales in the custom products segment rose during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the sales growth came from an sales increase in our consumer product lines  where sales were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal all of our consumer products are sold through our marketing and distribution partner  louisville bedding company 
in the other part of the custom products segment  industrial sales remained level at million in fiscal compared with fiscal as lower sales in the water sports market were mostly offset by higher sales in the automotive market 
gross profit our gross profit decreased by during fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal gross margin decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal the decreases in gross profit and gross margin were caused by the following factors a decline in sales volume and a less profitable sales mix within the medical segment  various raw material price increases during the last two quarters of fiscal and a less profitable sales mix for the total company because of the combination of higher sales in the custom products segment and lower sales in the medical segment 
the custom products segment made up of total net sales in this fiscal year compared with in fiscal selling  research development and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses increased less than  remaining at million and of net sales in both fiscal and fiscal the increase occurred in the medical segment and was primarily the result of higher shipping costs 
total research and development expenses decreased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the decrease was caused by the completion in late fiscal of several new product development projects that involved contract services 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the expense increase during fiscal resulted from mostly non recurring professional fees and other fees related to our acquisition of mc healthcare as previously discussed 
these increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses in fiscal in addition  we had income of  in fiscal from the cash value of life insurance compared with  in fiscal operating income in the medical segment  operating income for fiscal declined by to million compared with million in fiscal the decrease occurred because medical sales declined and raw material costs increased compared with last fiscal year 
operating income in the custom products segment decreased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal in spite of higher sales volume in the custom products segment  an increase in raw material costs and a less profitable sales mix among our consumer product lines caused the decline in operating income for the custom products segment 
operating income for the total company declined in fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal the decline in operating income was caused primarily by lower sales volume in the medical segment and higher raw material costs 
non operating income investment and other income decreased by to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the decrease was caused by an  gain on the sale of assets in fiscal year that was not repeated in fiscal and lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in interest expense we incurred no interest expense in fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion about our revolving credit facility 
net income and dividends net income decreased in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the decline in earnings was caused primarily by lower sales volume in the medical segment  a less profitable sales mix among our consumer products  a less profitable overall sales mix  higher raw material costs in both the medical and custom products segments and higher administrative expenses 
during fiscal  we paid dividends of million  or of net income for the year 
this amount consisted of two quarterly dividends of per share and two quarterly dividends of per share 
liquidity and capital resources we generated cash flow from operations of million during fiscal  which represented an increase of compared with cash flow of million in fiscal the primary reasons for the increase in cash flow during fiscal were higher net income  as previously described  and a decrease in inventory levels during the year 
inventory levels at fiscal year end  excluding inventory purchased in the mchp acquisition  declined by  compared with fiscal year end during the comparable period of fiscal year  inventory levels increased by million  primarily due to preparation for a large consumer products order that shipped in november this swing from a million increase in inventory in fiscal to a  inventory decrease in fiscal was the main reason for the large increase in cash flow from operations during fiscal see below for additional information about inventory levels 
major uses of cash provided by operations during fiscal included the purchase of the assets of mchp for cash at closing of million including the final working capital adjustment  payment of dividends of million and the purchase of other property and equipment of working capital decreased by  or  to million at fiscal year end compared with fiscal year end the decrease in working capital resulted from the liquidation of securities available for sale to fund the asset acquisition of mchp and increases in accrued income tax and incentive compensation during fiscal in addition  our current ratio decreased to at fiscal year end from at fiscal year end accounts receivable  net of allowances  increased  or million  to million at the end of fiscal compared with million at the end of fiscal the days sales outstanding or average collection time  calculated using a month average for trade accounts receivable balances  decreased to days in compared with days in approximately million included in accounts receivable at september  were for sales made by span canada 
all of our accounts receivable are unsecured 
certain receivables of span canada are insured under the terms of an insurance policy 
inventory  net of reserves  increased by million  or  to million at fiscal year end compared with million at fiscal year end excluding the inventory acquired as part of the mchp acquisition  inventory levels decreased by  during fiscal year at september  our inventory included approximately million of inventory belonging to mchp 
the work in process inventory shown in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements is associated entirely with mchp 
at year end in both fiscal and we were holding larger than normal amounts of consumer finished goods related to an order in each respective year that shipped the subsequent november 
inventory turns increased to times in fiscal compared with times in fiscal we experienced an increase in the reserve for obsolete inventory as a result of the mchp asset acquisition 
our deferred income tax asset increased by  or  during fiscal to  from  due mostly to incentive compensation accrued during fiscal that is not deductible for tax purposes until fiscal year net property and equipment increased by  or  during fiscal the increase was made up of  in depreciation expense  approximately  in equipment purchased as part of the mchp asset acquisition and  in other equipment purchases not related to the acquisition 
on december   we acquired substantially all of the assets of mchp  a privately owned manufacturer and marketer of medical bed frames and related products 
the purchase price was approximately million 
the transaction resulted in additional goodwill of approximately million and other intangible assets of million 
the acquisition related intangible assets included in other assets were made up of trade names  non compete agreements and customer relationships 
other assets increased to million at fiscal year end compared with million at fiscal year end mainly as a result of an increase in the cash value of corporate owned life insurance policies 
our accounts payable increased by to million at fiscal year end compared with million at fiscal year end the balance at fiscal year end included approximately  in accounts payable of mchp 
excluding the mchp accounts payable at fiscal year end  accounts payable would have decreased by approximately  due to normal fluctuations in accounts payable levels 
accrued and sundry liabilities  including obligations for span canada  increased by during the year to million compared with million last year due mainly to higher levels of accrued income taxes payable and incentive compensation 
in connection with our acquisition of the assets of mchp  we borrowed million under our revolving credit agreement in early december during the remainder of fiscal  we borrowed additional funds primarily for working capital needs related to the two consumer sales promotions that took place in the first and second quarters of fiscal and the unusually high sales of mchp products during the second quarter of fiscal as of september   we had no borrowings under our existing revolving line of credit 
on december  we amended and restated our revolving credit agreement in connection with the acquisition of the assets of mchp 
the maximum principal amount we can borrow at any one time under the loan agreement is million 
the maturity date was extended to april  the agreement is unsecured and accrues interest at a variable rate equal to day libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points depending on our leverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
the current margin is basis points 
the interest rate  including the margin  in november  was 
interest only payments are required monthly 
there is a basis point annual fee on any unused availability above million payable quarterly 
we have pledged to grant the bank a security interest in our accounts  instruments  and chattel paper upon its request in the event of a default as defined in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by our new subsidiary span medical products canada inc the credit facility includes financial covenants relating to tangible net worth and leverage ratios  and restricts mergers and acquisitions  assets sales  indebtedness  liens and capital expenditures 
the credit facility also restricts dividends and stock repurchases during any fiscal year to an aggregate amount of no more than of the sum of i our income from continuing operations for that fiscal year plus ii the absolute value of any aggregate after tax  non cash and extraordinary losses for that fiscal year 
as an exception to the restriction above  we may pay a regular quarterly dividend in an amount no greater than the previous quarter s regular dividend so long as we remain in compliance with the financial covenants after giving effect to the payment of the dividend 
also  our wholly owned subsidiary  span canada  is not restricted in its ability to pay dividends or make distributions to the parent company 
violation of loan covenants could result in acceleration of the term of the agreement 
we believe that we were in compliance with the loan covenants as of september  in november  we announced a program to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
in february  the board expanded the repurchase program by  shares  bringing the total number of authorized shares to  as of september   we had repurchased a total of  shares under the expanded program at an average price of per share  representing a total investment of million 
considering these prior purchases  we are authorized to repurchase an additional  shares under the current program 
we may continue to repurchase our stock from time to time in the open market or in private transactions  depending on market and company conditions 
the stock repurchase program  however  may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
in november  the board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share and a regular quarterly cash dividend of cents per share 
the special dividend and the regular quarterly dividend were paid on december   to shareholders of record on november  we believe that funds on hand  funds generated from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility are adequate to finance our operations and expected capital requirements during fiscal and for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
for additional information regarding these obligations  see the referenced footnotes in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item below 
payments due by period contractual obligations dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations note purchase obligations note deferred compensation note total contractual obligations impact of inflation and cost of raw materials general market inflation was low in the united states and canada during fiscal and was consequently a minor factor in our operations for the year 
however  volatility in the cost of polyurethane foam  our primary raw material in the us  was a significant factor for our operations during fiscal in april  our cost of foam rose between and  depending on the type of foam 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced decreases of approximately in the costs of some of our foam raw materials 
we have taken various actions to mitigate the effect of these cost increases 
however  we can give no assurance that we will be able to fully offset these cost increases in the future  and the failure to do so could negatively affect our profitability 
based on current conditions in the markets for our primary raw materials  we expect inflation to be a moderate factor for our operations during fiscal the cost of polyurethane foam  our primary raw material  is indirectly influenced by oil prices 
however  other market factors also affect foam prices  including the available supply of component chemicals  demand for related products from domestic and international manufacturers  competition among domestic suppliers  our purchase volumes and regulatory requirements 
consequently  it is difficult for us to accurately predict the impact that future inflation and other factors might have on the cost of polyurethane foam  our largest volume raw material 
foreign currency exchange span canada  operating under the name mc healthcare products  uses the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations  which vary based on volume and currency market conditions 
these exchange rate fluctuations will cause foreign exchange gains and losses  which could be material to our results of operations depending on currency market conditions and the timing and levels of our business activities in the u 
s and canada 
for fiscal year  our realized foreign currency exchange loss was  critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements that we prepare in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions also require the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make forecasts about future events and their estimated impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
any differences could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the accounting policies more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report  we have identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit evaluations are undertaken to set credit limits for all customers 
we regularly evaluate past due accounts included in our accounts receivable and provide what we estimate to be adequate reserves for doubtful accounts 
customer financial conditions may change and increase the risk of non collectability and may require additional provisions  which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of september  and october  our provision for doubtful accounts was approximately  and  respectively 
this represented approximately of total accounts receivable at fiscal year end compared with of total accounts receivable at fiscal year end reserve for obsolete and excess inventories we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of future product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimates  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
as of september   our provision for excess and obsolete inventory represented approximately of total inventories  or approximately  this compares with  or  of total inventories at fiscal year end the increase in our inventory reserve in both dollars and percent was caused by the asset acquisition of mc healthcare 
warranty obligations we warrant certain of our products for specific periods of time against manufacturing or performance defects 
we provide for the estimated future cost of warranty obligations in cost of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty cost represents our best estimate at the time of sale of the total cost that we will incur to repair or replace covered products or parts 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty cost is primarily based on historical experience as well as current information on repair costs 
actual warranty cost could differ from these estimated amounts 
in addition  we receive warranties from certain suppliers of key components of our products  and we rely on these suppliers to replace or provide credit for their defective goods that might be used in our products 
such replacements or credits reduce our direct warranty costs 
if our suppliers failed to honor their warranties  our warranty cost could increase 
we review the accrued balances on a quarterly basis and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if our estimated warranty costs were too low  we would be required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future  which would negatively affect our operating results 
our actual warranty expense was approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal our accrued warranty costs at september   were  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on product warranties 
impairment of goodwill impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group is greater than its fair value 
the assets of our medical business include a significant amount of goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill in our medical business unit for impairment at least annually  in september  or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of our medical business unit 
for fiscal year end  we determined that the fair value of the medical business unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no impairment charge was required 
in assessing the value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the medical business unit 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges  which would negatively impact operating results 
as of september   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and is greater than its fair value  the asset is impaired and an impairment loss must be recognized 
present value of deferred compensation we are obligated under the terms of a retirement agreement to make fixed payments for the remaining lives of span america s founder and his ex wife as discussed in note deferred compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this obligation can be funded from internally generated cash or from the cash value of company owned life insurance policies  which had a value of million at september  see item a below and notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on deferred compensation and the cash value of life insurance 
we have fully accrued the present value of the expected payments due over the combined estimated life expectancy of our founder and his ex wife 
in calculating this present value we used a discount rate of  which was an estimate of the effective long term rate of return on the portfolio 
if the actual rate of return was significantly lower than our estimate and we were required to accrue additional deferred compensation costs in the future  it would negatively affect operating results 
as of september   we had recorded a deferred compensation liability of approximately  including current and long term portions 
if we reduced the discount rate by  the deferred compensation liability would be increased by approximately  and pre tax income would be reduced by the same amount 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk in three areas cash value of life insurance  our credit facility and foreign currency exchange 
other assets at september  included million in cash value of life insurance  which is subject to market risk related to equity pricing and interest rate changes 
the cash value is generated from life insurance policies that are being used as the funding vehicle for a retirement program for span america s founder and former chairman 
see present value of deferred compensation above 
the cash value is invested in a combination of fixed income life insurance contracts and a portfolio of mutual funds managed by an insurance company 
the fixed income contracts are similar to fixed income bond funds and are therefore subject to interest rate and company risk 
the mutual fund portfolios invest in common stocks and bonds in accordance with their individual investment objectives 
these portfolios are exposed to stock market and interest rate risk similar to comparable mutual funds 
we believe that substantial fluctuations in equity markets and interest rates and the resulting changes in cash value of life insurance would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash value of life insurance increased by  creating after tax income of approximately  our credit facility accrues interest at a variable rate equal to day libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points depending on our then applicable leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
interest is payable monthly 
the interest rate at november was 
beginning april   the credit facility also includes an annual unused commitment fee of basis points  payable quarterly  on any unused line of credit availability over  an increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our financial condition and earnings to the extent that we had outstanding borrowings under the facility 
the degree of impact would vary depending on the level of the borrowings 
we repaid the outstanding balance of our long term debt during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year and had no outstanding balance as of september  in addition  as a result of the mchp acquisition  we now manufacture and sell products in the us and canada 
revenues and costs are incurred in both us and canadian dollars 
we are therefore subject to realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency translation activities related to our operations 
these foreign exchange gains or losses could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars has been relatively stable since the mchp acquisition 
consequently  we do not currently actively manage our foreign exchange risk
