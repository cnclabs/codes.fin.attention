item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  those described above under item a 
risk factors  and forward looking statements safe harbor below 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

table of contents we are a leading provider of government outsourced services specializing in the management of correctional  detention  mental health  residential treatment and re entry facilities  and the provision of community based services and youth services in the united states  australia  south africa  the united kingdom and canada 
we operate a broad range of correctional and detention facilities including maximum  medium and minimum security prisons  immigration detention centers  minimum security detention centers  mental health  residential treatment and community based re entry facilities 
we offer counseling  education and or treatment to inmates with alcohol and drug abuse problems at most of the domestic facilities we manage 
as of january   our worldwide operations included the management and or ownership of approximately  beds at correctional  detention and residential treatment facilities  including idle facilities and projects under development  and also included the provision of monitoring approximately  offenders in a community based environment on behalf of approximately federal  state and local correctional agencies located in all states 
our correctional and detention management services involve the provision of security  administrative  rehabilitation  education  health and food services  primarily at adult male correctional and detention facilities 
our mental health and residential treatment services are operated by our geo care business segment and involve working with governments to deliver quality care  innovative programming and active patient treatment primarily in privately operated state mental health care facilities 
our community based services  operated through our geo care business segment  involve supervision of adult parolees and probationers and the provision of temporary housing  programming  employment assistance and other services with the intention of the successful reintegration of residents into the community 
our youth services division  operated through the geo care business segment  include residential  detention and shelter care and community based services along with rehabilitative  educational and treatment programs 
our monitoring services  operated through the geo care business segment  provide our governmental clients with innovative compliance technologies  industry leading monitoring services  and evidence based supervision and treatment programs for community based parolees  probationers and pretrial defendants  including services to ice for the provision of services designed to improve the participation of non detained aliens in the immigration court system 
we develop new facilities  using our project development experience to design  construct and finance what we believe are state of the art facilities that maximize security and efficiency 
we also provide secure transportation services for offender and detainee populations as contracted domestically  and in the united kingdom  our joint venture geoamey is responsible for providing prisoner escort and custody services in the united kingdom  including all of wales and all of england except london and east of england 
for the fiscal year ended january   we had consolidated revenues of billion and we maintained an average companywide facility occupancy rate of  excluding facilities that are either idle or under development 
critical accounting policies we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition facility management revenues are recognized as services are provided under facility management contracts with approved government appropriations based on a net rate per day per inmate or on a fixed monthly rate 
a limited number of our contracts have provisions upon which a small portion of the revenue for the contract is based on the performance of certain targets 
revenue based on the performance of certain targets is less than of our consolidated annual revenues 
these performance targets are based on specific criteria to be met over specific periods of time 
such criteria includes our ability to achieve certain contractual benchmarks relative to the quality of service we provide  non occurrence of certain disruptive events  effectiveness of our quality control programs and our responsiveness to customer requirements and concerns 
for the limited number of contracts where revenue is based on the performance of certain targets  revenue is either i recorded pro rata when revenue is fixed and determinable or ii recorded when the specified time period lapses 
in many instances  we are a party to more than one contract with a single entity 
in these instances  each contract is accounted for separately 
we have not recorded any revenue that is at risk due to future performance contingencies 
construction revenues are recognized from our contracts with certain customers to perform construction and design services project development services for various facilities 
in these instances  we act as the primary developer and subcontract with bonded national and or regional design build contractors 
these construction revenues are recognized as earned on a percentage of completion basis measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total cost for each contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes to cost estimates are made in the period in which we determine that such losses and changes are probable 
typically  we enter into fixed price contracts and do not perform additional work unless approved change orders are in place 
costs attributable to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred if we believe that it is not probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
if we believe that it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price  costs related to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which they are incurred  and contract revenue is recognized to the extent of the costs incurred 
revenue in excess of the costs attributable to unapproved change orders is not recognized until the change order is approved 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to estimated costs and income  and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
as the primary contractor  we are exposed to the various risks associated with construction  including the risk of cost overruns 
accordingly  we record our construction revenue on a gross basis and include the related cost of construction activities in operating expenses 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements for certain contracts where we provide project development services to our clients in addition to standard management services  we follow revenue recognition guidance for multiple element arrangements 
this revenue recognition guidance related to multiple deliverables in an arrangement provides guidance on determining if separate contracts should be evaluated as a single arrangement and if an arrangement involves a single unit of accounting or separate units of accounting and if the arrangement is determined to have separate units  how to allocate amounts received in the arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
in instances where we provide these project development services and subsequent management services  generally  the arrangement results in no delivered elements at the onset of the agreement 
the elements are delivered over the contract period as the project development and management services are performed 
project development services are not provided separately to a customer without a management contract 
during the fiscal year ended january  we implemented asu no 
which provides amendments to revenue recognition criteria for separating consideration in multiple element arrangements 
the implementation of this standard in the fiscal year ended january  did not have a material impact on our 
table of contents financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the amendments  among other things  establish the selling price of a deliverable  replace the term fair value with selling price and eliminate the residual method such that consideration can be allocated to the deliverables using the relative selling price method based on geo s specific assumptions 
as a result of the bi acquisition  we also periodically sell our monitoring equipment and other services together in multiple element arrangements 
in such cases  we allocate revenue on the basis of the relative selling price of the delivered and undelivered elements 
the selling price for each of the elements is estimated based on the price we charge when the elements are sold on a stand alone basis 
reserves for insurance losses the nature of our business exposes us to various types of third party legal claims  including  but not limited to  civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and or mistreatment  sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees  medical malpractice claims  product liability claims  intellectual property infringement claims  claims relating to employment matters including  but not limited to  employment discrimination claims  union grievances and wage and hour claims  property loss claims  environmental claims  automobile liability claims  contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities  programs  electronic monitoring products  personnel or prisoners  including damages arising from a prisoner s escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility 
in addition  our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation 
we maintain a broad program of insurance coverage for these general types of claims  except for claims relating to employment matters  for which we carry no insurance 
there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed 
it is our general practice to bring merged or acquired companies into our corporate master policies in order to take advantage of certain economies of scale 
we currently maintain a general liability policy and excess liability policies with total limits of million per occurrence and in the aggregate covering the operations of us corrections detention  geo care s community based services  geo care s youth services and bi 
in addition  geo care s residential treatment services division has a separate claims made liability insurance program for their mental health facilities with a specific loss limit of million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
that same million limit also applies to medical professional liability claims arising out of correctional healthcare services 
we are uninsured for any claims in excess of these limits 
we also maintain insurance to cover property and other casualty risks including  workers compensation  environmental liability and automobile liability 
for most casualty insurance policies  we carry substantial deductibles or self insured retentions of million per occurrence for general liability and hospital professional liability  million per occurrence for workers compensation and million per occurrence for automobile liability 
in addition  certain of our facilities located in florida and other high risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles 
since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events  no reserves have been established to pre fund for potential windstorm damage 
limited commercial availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure  mainly in california and the pacific northwest  may prevent us from insuring some of our facilities to full replacement value 
with respect to our operations in south africa  the united kingdom and australia  we utilize a combination of locally procured insurance and global policies to meet contractual insurance requirements and protect the company 
in addition to these policies  our australian subsidiary carries tail insurance on a general liability policy related to a discontinued contract 
of the reserves discussed above  our most significant insurance reserves relate to workers compensation and general liability claims 
these reserves are undiscounted and were million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
we use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported 
in applying these methods and assessing their results  we consider such factors as historical frequency and severity of claims at each of our 
table of contents facilities  claim development  payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business  among other factors 
such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments 
our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services and unpredictability of the size of jury awards 
we also may experience variability between our estimates and the actual settlement due to limitations inherent in the estimation process  including our ability to estimate costs of processing and settling claims in a timely manner as well as our ability to accurately estimate our exposure at the onset of a claim 
because we have high deductible insurance policies  the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on our ability to control our claims experience 
if actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
significant judgments are required to determine the consolidated provision for income taxes 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon many factors such as tax regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income and the character of such taxable income 
additionally  we must use significant judgment in addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets or liabilities may be required  which may result in an adverse impact on the results of our operations and our effective tax rate 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria 
management has not made any significant changes to the way we account for our deferred tax assets and liabilities in any year presented in the consolidated financial statements 
based on our estimate of future earnings and our favorable earnings history  management currently expects full realization of the deferred tax assets net of any recorded valuation allowances 
furthermore  tax positions taken by us may not be fully sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
in determining the adequacy of our provision benefit for income taxes  potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations are regularly assessed 
as such  the final outcome of tax examinations  including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues  cannot be estimated with certainty 
to the extent that the provision for income taxes increases decreases by of income before income taxes  equity in earnings of affiliate  discontinued operations  and consolidated income from continuing operations would have decreased increased by million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended january   january  and january  property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
equipment and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over to years 
accelerated methods of depreciation are generally used for income tax purposes 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
we perform ongoing assessments of the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset 
if the assessment indicates that assets will be used for a longer or shorter period than previously anticipated  the useful lives of the assets are revised  resulting in a change in estimate 
in our first fiscal quarter ended april   we completed a depreciation study on our owned correctional facilities 
based on the results of the depreciation study  we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our buildings from our historical estimate of years to a revised estimate of years  effective january  maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
interest is capitalized in connection with facility construction 
capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset s estimated useful life 

table of contents we review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment assessment include deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long lived assets  or when other changes occur that might impair recovery of long lived assets such as the termination of a management contract 
if impairment indicators are present  we perform a recoverability test to determine whether or not an impairment loss should be measured 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition 
for the purposes of the recoverability test  if a long lived asset is part of a group that includes other assets  the unit of accounting for the long lived asset is its group 
generally  we group our assets by facility for the purposes of considering whether any impairment exists 
when considering the future cash flows of a facility  we make assumptions based on historical experience with our customers  current data related to the pricing of our management contracts  residual value of our facilities  and or terminal growth rates 
while these estimates do not generally have a material impact on the impairment charges associated with managed only facilities  the sensitivity increases significantly when considering the impairment on facilities that are either owned or leased by us due to the investment we make in buildings and improvements for owned and leased facilities 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
impact of future accounting pronouncements the following accounting standards have an implementation date subsequent to the fiscal year ended january  and as such  have not yet been adopted by us during the fiscal year ended january  in may  the fasb issued asu no 
which provides a consistent definition of fair value in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs and ensures that their respective fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are the same except for minor differences in wording and style 
the amendments change certain fair value measurement principles and enhance the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
the standard will become effective for us during interim and annual periods beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively 
we do not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
which requires an entity to present all nonowner changes in stockholders equity either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this standard will become effective for us in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively 
we do not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu in order to defer only those changes in update that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
no other requirements in asu were affected by this update  including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
asu is effective for us in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we do not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows

the remaining increase is primarily driven by the activation of riverbend in december which resulted in additional depreciation expense of million 
geo care the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for geo care of million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily due to our acquisitions of bi and cornell which contributed increases to depreciation and amortization expense of million and million  respectively

liquidity and capital resources on august   we entered into a new credit agreement  which we refer to as our senior credit facility by and among geo  as borrower  bnp paribas  as administrative agent  and the lenders who are  or may from time to time become  a party thereto 
on august   we used proceeds from borrowings under the senior credit facility primarily to repay existing borrowings and accrued interest under the third amended and restated credit agreement  which we refer to as our prior senior credit agreement  of million and to pay million for financing fees related to the senior credit facility 
on august   our prior senior credit agreement was terminated 
we accounted for the termination of our prior senior credit agreement as an extinguishment of debt 
in connection with repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the termination of the prior senior credit agreement  we wrote off million of associated deferred financing fees in third quarter on august   in connection with the cornell acquisition  we used aggregate proceeds of million from the term loan a and the revolver primarily to repay cornell s obligations plus accrued interest under its revolving line of credit due december of million  to repay its obligations plus accrued interest under the existing senior notes due july of million  to pay million in transaction costs and to pay the cash component of the merger consideration of million 
on february   we entered into amendment no 
to the senior credit facility  which we refer to as amendment no 
amendment no 
 among other things  amended certain definitions and covenants relating to the total leverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratios set forth in the senior credit facility 
this amendment increased our borrowing capacity under the revolver by million and increased the term loans under the senior credit facility by million  specifically under a new million incremental term loan a on february   we used the funds from the new million incremental term loan a along with the net cash proceeds from the offering of the senior notes to finance the acquisition of bi 
on may   we executed amendment no 
to the senior credit facility  which we refer to as amendment no 
as a result of this amendment  relative to our term loan b  the applicable rate was reduced to per annum from per annum in the case of eurodollar loans and to per annum from per annum in the case of abr loans and the libor floor was reduced to from 
as of january   the senior credit facility was comprised of i a million term loan a bearing interest at libor plus and maturing august   ii a million term loan a bearing interest at libor plus and maturing august   iii a million term loan b  bearing interest at libor plus with a libor floor of and maturing august  and iv the revolver of million bearing interest at libor plus and maturing august  on july   we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock effective through december  the stock repurchase program will be funded primarily with cash on hand  free cash flow  and borrowings under our revolver 
the stock repurchase program is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  in accordance with applicable securities and stock exchange requirements 
the program may also include repurchases from time to time from executive officers or directors of vested restricted stock and or vested stock options 
the stock repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any specific 
table of contents amount of our common stock and may be suspended or extended at any time at our discretion 
during the fiscal year ended january   we purchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million primarily with proceeds from our revolver 
our board determined in february to adopt a dividend policy 
under the dividend policy  we anticipate that we will pay quarterly dividends beginning in the fourth quarter of in the amount of 
per share for a total of 
per share in annual dividends  subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board that cash dividends are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and our agreements applicable to the declaration of cash dividends  including our indentures and senior credit facility 
based on million shares outstanding as of january   a quarterly cash dividend of 
per share would have resulted in a quarterly cash dividend of million in the aggregate 
based on our current capitalization  we do not believe that making dividend payments will materially adversely impact our liquidity 
we believe we have the ability to declare quarterly cash dividends  as well as continue to fund the stock repurchase program  our working capital  our debt service requirements  and our maintenance and growth capital expenditure requirements  while maintaining sufficient liquidity for other corporate purposes 
as of january   we had million outstanding under the term loan a  million outstanding under the term loan a  million outstanding under the term loan b  net of million discount  and our million revolving credit facility had million outstanding in loans  million outstanding in letters of credit and million available for borrowings 
we also had the ability to borrow million under the accordion feature of our senior credit facility subject to lender demand and market conditions 
our significant debt obligations could have material consequences 
see risk factors risks related to our high level of indebtedness 
we plan to fund all of our capital needs  including our capital expenditures  from cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility and any other financings which our management and board of directors  in their discretion  may consummate 
currently  our primary source of liquidity to meet these requirements is cash flow from operations and borrowings from the million revolver 
our management believes that cash on hand  cash flows from operations and availability under our senior credit facility will be adequate to support our capital requirements for and disclosed under capital requirements above 
we are also in the process of bidding on  or evaluating potential bids for  the design  construction and management of a number of new projects 
in the event that we win bids for these projects and decide to self finance their construction  our capital requirements in and or could materially increase 
in that event  our cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowings under the existing senior credit facility may not provide sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs through and we could be forced to seek additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that any such financing or refinancing would be available to us on terms equal to or more favorable than our current financing terms  or at all 
in the future  our access to capital and ability to compete for future capital intensive projects will also be dependent upon  among other things  our ability to meet certain financial covenants in the indenture governing the senior notes  the indenture governing the senior notes and our senior credit facility 
a substantial decline in our financial performance could limit our access to capital pursuant to these covenants and have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and capital resources and  as a result  on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to these foregoing potential constraints on our capital  a number of state government agencies have been suffering from budget deficits and liquidity issues 
while we expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants  if these constraints were to intensify  our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted as could our compliance with these debt covenants

if the company s ceo had retired as of january   the company would have had to pay him million including a tax gross up relating to the retirement payment equal to million 
based on our current capitalization  we do not believe that making this payment would materially adversely impact our liquidity

table of contents shareholder s loan expire upon the earlier of full funding or release from sacs of its obligations under its debt agreements 
the lenders ability to draw on the shareholder s loan is limited to certain circumstances  including termination of the contract 
we have also guaranteed certain obligations of sacs to the security trustee for sacs lenders 
we have secured our guarantee to the security trustee by ceding our rights to claims against sacs in respect of any loans or other finance agreements  and by pledging our shares in sacs 
our liability under the guarantee is limited to the cession and pledge of shares 
the guarantee expires upon expiration of the cession and pledge agreements 
in connection with a design  build  finance and maintenance contract for a facility in canada  we guaranteed certain potential tax obligations of a trust 
the potential estimated exposure of these obligations is cad million  or million as of january   commencing in we have a liability of million and million related to this exposure as of january  and january   respectively 
to secure this guarantee  we purchased canadian dollar denominated securities with maturities matched to the estimated tax obligations in to we have recorded an asset and a liability equal to the current fair market value of those securities on our balance sheet 
we do not currently operate or manage this facility 
at january   we also had eight letters of guarantee outstanding totaling million under separate international facilities relating to performance guarantees of our australian subsidiary

our maximum exposure relative to the joint venture is our note receivable of million  including accrued interest of million  and future financial support necessary to guarantee performance under the contract 
except as discussed above  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
we are also exposed to various commitments and contingencies which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
see part i item legal proceedings 
derivatives as of january   we have four interest rate swap agreements the agreements in the aggregate notional amount of million 
we have designated these interest rate swaps as hedges against changes in the fair value of a designated portion of the senior notes due to changes in underlying interest rates 
these interest rate swaps  which have payment  expiration dates and call provisions that mirror the terms of the senior notes  effectively convert million of the senior notes into variable rate obligations 
each of the swaps has a termination clause that gives the counterparty the right to terminate the interest rate swaps at fair market value  under certain circumstances 
in addition to the termination clause  the agreements also have call provisions which specify that the lender can elect to settle the swap for the call option price 
under these interest rate swaps  we receive a fixed interest rate payment from the financial counterparties to the agreements equal to per year calculated on the notional million amount  while we make a variable interest rate payment to the same counterparties equal to the three month libor plus a fixed margin of between and  also calculated on the notional million amount 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in earnings along with related designated changes in the value of the senior notes 
total net gains loss  entirely offset by a corresponding increase decrease in the fair value of the variable rate portion of the senior notes  recognized and recorded in earnings related to these fair value hedges was million  million and million in the fiscal periods ended january   january  and january   respectively 
as of january  and january   the fair value of the swap assets was million and 
table of contents million  respectively 
there was no material ineffectiveness of these interest rate swaps during any of the fiscal years ended january   january  or january  our australian subsidiary is a party to an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on the variable rate non recourse debt to 
we have determined the swap  which has a notional amount of million  payment and expiration dates  and call provisions that coincide with the terms of the nonrecourse debt  to be an effective cash flow hedge 
accordingly  we record the change in the value of the interest rate swap in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable income taxes 
total unrealized gain loss  net of tax  recognized in the fiscal years ended january   january  and january  and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  related to this cash flow hedge was million  million  and million  respectively 
the total value of the swap asset as of january  and january  was million and million  respectively  and is recorded as a component of other assets within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
there was no ineffectiveness of this interest rate swap for the fiscal years presented 
we do not expect to enter into any transactions during the next twelve months which would result in the reclassification into earnings or losses associated with this swap currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following is a table of certain of our contractual obligations  as of january   which requires us to make payments over the periods presented 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt term loans revolver capital lease obligations includes imputed interest operating lease obligations non recourse debt estimated interest payments on debt a estimated funding of pension and other post retirement benefits estimated construction commitments estimated tax payments for uncertain tax positions b total a due to the uncertainties of future libor rates  the variable interest payments on our senior credit facility and swap agreements were calculated using an average libor rate of based on projected interest rates through fiscal b state income tax payments are reflected net of the federal income tax benefit 
except as discussed above  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements which would subject us to additional liabilities 

table of contents cash flow cash and cash equivalents as of january  was million  compared to million as of january  and was impacted by the following cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in was positively impacted by increases in net income attributable to geo  non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense as well as from cash dividends received from our joint venture in south africa of million 
these positive impacts were offset by a decrease in cash due to timing of cash collections and payments 
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in was impacted by the effect of certain significant non cash items such as positive impacts of depreciation and amortization expense of million and the write off of deferred financing fees of million associated with the termination of our third amended and restated credit agreement in third quarter the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily the result of the additional amortization of intangible assets and the depreciation of fixed assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of cornell 
these positive impacts were partially offset by the timing of cash collections and payments 
in  cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was positively impacted by an increase in net income attributable to geo of million over the prior year as well as the impact of certain non cash items including depreciation and amortization expense of million and the write off of deferred financing fees of million 
cash used in investing activities in of million primarily related to our cash consideration of the purchase of bi for million and million for capital expenditures 
cash used in investing activities in of million was primarily the result of our acquisition of cornell in august for million and capital expenditures of million compared to cash used in investing activities during of million which primarily consisted of our acquisition of just care for million and capital expenditures of million 
cash provided by financing activities in of million reflects proceeds from our senior credit facility and senior notes of million and proceeds of million from our revenue bonds  net of discount  offset by payments on indebtedness of million 
we also made a cash distribution of million to the partners of mcf and paid million in connection with the issuance of revenue bonds and the financing of the bi acquisition 
additionally  we paid million in for purchases of our common stock 
cash provided by financing activities in was million and reflects cash proceeds from our senior credit facility consisting of million in borrowings under the term loan a  million of borrowings under the term loan b with a total discount of million  and of million of borrowings under our revolver 
these proceeds were offset by payments of million for the repayment of our prior term loan b  payments of million on our revolver  and payments of million on non recourse debt  term loans and other debt 
in addition  we paid million for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program and million for shares of common stock which were purchased from certain directors and executives and retired immediately after purchase 
cash provided by financing activities in was million and reflects cash proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes of million and prior revolver borrowings of million 
these proceeds were offset by payments of million for repayment of our senior notes  payments of million on our prior revolver and payments on non recourse debt and prior term loan b of million 
cash proceeds from our senior notes were primarily used to pay down our senior notes and our prior revolver 
inflation we believe that inflation  in general  did not have a material effect on our results of operations during  and while some of our contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing  inflation could have a 
table of contents substantial adverse effect on our results of operations in the future to the extent that wages and salaries  which represent our largest expense  increase at a faster rate than the per diem or fixed rates received by us for our management services 
outlook the following discussion of our future performance contains statements that are not historical statements and  therefore  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statement 
please refer to item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k  the forward looking statements safe harbor  as well as the other disclosures contained in this annual report on form k  for further discussion on forward looking statements and the risks and other factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals and cause the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward looking statements 
with state and federal prison populations growing by approximately since  the private corrections industry has played an increasingly important role in addressing us detention and correctional needs 
the number of state and federal prisoners housed in private facilities has increased by since the year with the federal government and states such as arizona  texas and florida accounting for a significant portion of the increase 
at year end  of the estimated million state and federal prisoners incarcerated in the united states were held in private facilities  up from in in addition to our strong positions in federal and state markets in the us  we believe we are the only publicly traded us correctional company with international operations 
with the existing operations in south africa  australia  and the united kingdom  we believe that our international presence positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities within the private corrections and detention industry in new and established international markets 
we intend to pursue a diversified growth strategy by winning new customers and contracts  expanding our government services portfolio and pursuing selective acquisition opportunities 
we achieve organic growth through competitive bidding that begins with the issuance by a government agency of a request for proposal  or rfp 
we primarily rely on the rfp process for organic growth in our us and international corrections operations as well as in geo care s operations 
we believe that our long operating history and reputation have earned us credibility with both existing and prospective clients when bidding on new facility management contracts or when renewing existing contracts 
our success in the rfp process has resulted in a pipeline of new projects with significant revenue potential 
in  we activated five new or expansion projects representing an aggregate of  additional beds 
this compares to the three new or expansion projects activated in representing  new beds 
as of january   we have two facilities under various stages of development or pending commencement of operations which represent  beds 
in addition to pursuing organic growth through the rfp process  we will from time to time selectively consider the financing and construction of new facilities or expansions to existing facilities on a speculative basis without having a signed contract with a known customer 
we also plan to leverage our experience to expand the range of government outsourced services that we provide 
we will continue to pursue selected acquisition opportunities in our core services and other government services areas that meet our criteria for growth and profitability 
the strategic acquisitions of cornell companies and bi incorporated have further diversified geo  creating a stronger company with a full continuum of care service platform and leading competitive positions in key market segments in the corrections  detention  and rehabilitation treatment services industry 
from the development of facilities  to the intake and housing of offenders  to the provision of transportation functions as well as comprehensive medical  mental health and rehabilitation services  to the reintegration and supervision of offenders in the community  we believe governmental clients are increasingly looking for full service  turnkey solutions that can deliver enhanced quality and cost savings across a comprehensive continuum of care 
following the completion of the cornell and bi acquisitions  we are positioned to provide complementary  full service continuum of care solutions for our numerous government clients 

table of contents revenue domestically  we continue to pursue a number of opportunities in the privatized corrections and detention industry 
overcrowding at corrections facilities in various states and increased demand for bed space at federal prisons and detention facilities are two of the factors that have contributed to the opportunities for privatization 
we expect to compete on procurements at the state level which represent approximately  to  correctional beds 
in new hampshire  the state has issued rfps for a new correctional facility totaling approximately  to  beds 
in arizona  we were competing on a procurement for  in state beds 
in december  the state of arizona cancelled the procurement and announced that a new rfp for  state beds will be issued in in florida  the department of corrections had issued a request for proposal rfp for the management  under one single contract  of all correctional facilities  reception centers  work camps  and community based work release centers in south florida  which total approximately  to  beds 
the rfp was expected to result in a contract start date of january   however  in late september  a florida circuit court stopped the procurement on the basis that the means through which the project was legislated was unconstitutional 
in february  the florida legislature introduced standalone legislation relative to the procurement  however  the legislation was not approved by the florida senate 
we believe that florida s legislative and executive leaders continue to support public private partnerships that can result in significant savings for the taxpayers and improved offender rehabilitation 
we will continue to monitor this potential opportunity in florida and we also hope that other opportunities will develop at the state level over the coming years as states across the country look for ways to maximize savings and improve offender rehabilitation 
we continue to be encouraged by opportunities as discussed above  however any positive trends may  to some extent  be adversely impacted by government budgetary constraints in the future 
while only four states have reported new budget gaps and states are on target to meet revenue expectations during their fiscal year  officials in at least states are concerned with their overall fiscal outlook according to a recent survey by the national conference of state legislatures 
as a result of budgetary pressures  state correctional agencies may pursue a number of cost savings initiatives which may include the early release of inmates  changes to parole laws and sentencing guidelines  and reductions in per diem rates and or the scope of services provided by private operators 
these potential cost savings initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our current operations and or our ability to pursue new business opportunities 
effective october   the state of california began implementing its criminal justice realignment plan  which is expected to delegate tens of thousands of low level state offenders to local county jurisdictions in california 
as a result of this decision  we received written notice from the california department of corrections and rehabilitation regarding the cancellation of our agreements for the housing of low level state offenders at three of our california community corrections facilities 
in january  we also received notice from the cdcr of its intention to terminate the contract at golden state medium community correctional facility effective july  we plan to market these facilities for use by local county jurisdictions in california 
additionally  if state budgetary constraints  as discussed above  persist or intensify  our state customers ability to pay us may be impaired and or we may be forced to renegotiate our management contracts on less favorable terms and our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 
we plan to actively bid on any new projects that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
although we are pleased with the overall industry outlook  positive trends in the industry may be offset by several factors  including budgetary constraints  unanticipated contract terminations  contract non renewals  and or contract re bids 
although we have historically had a relatively high contract renewal rate  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our expiring management contracts on favorable terms  or at all 
also  while we are pleased with our track record in re bid situations  we cannot assure that we will prevail in any such future situations 
internationally  on september   we assumed the management of the bed dungavel house immigration removal centre located near glasgow  scotland 
we executed the contract for the management and operation of this facility with the united kingdom border agency in march on august   our newly formed joint venture in the united kingdom  which we refer to as geoamey  began providing prison escort and custody services for the ministry of justice in the united kingdom under three contracts awarded to geoamey in march also in the united kingdom  the government issued a procurement for the private management of nine existing prison facilities which total approximately  beds 
geo has gone through the 
table of contents prequalification process for this procurement and has been invited to compete on these opportunities 
we began competition for these opportunities in the fourth quarter of and expect contract awards to be announced in fall of we believe there will be additional opportunities in the united kingdom such as additional market testing of prisons  electronic monitoring of offenders and community corrections 
in south africa  the department of correctional services dcs had previously issued an rfp to privatize the development and operation of four  bed prison projects totaling  beds 
requests for proposal were issued in december in october  we were notified by the dcs that the procurement was cancelled 
we will continue to monitor opportunities in south africa 
in august  our geo australia subsidiary submitted a formal proposal in response to the new zealand government s request for proposal for a new design  build  finance and management contract for a new correctional center for beds 
our geo australia subsidiary had been short listed in this procurement  however  we have been notified that our bid is no longer under consideration based on its proposal terms 
we are exploring other opportunities in international markets and will continue to actively bid on any opportunities that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
with respect to our mental health  residential treatment  youth services  electronic monitoring services  and re entry services business conducted through our geo care business segment  we are currently pursuing a number of business development opportunities 
in connection with our merger with cornell in august and our acquisition of bi in february  we have significantly expanded geo care s operations by adding facilities  non residential service centers  and day reporting centers 
we also expanded the service offerings of geo care by adding electronic monitoring services  community re entry and immigration related supervision services 
through both organic growth and acquisitions  and subsequent to our acquisition of bi in february  we have been able to grow geo care s business to approximately  beds and approximately  offenders under community supervision 
geo care assumed management and operation of the new bed montgomery county mental health treatment facility in texas in march the opening of this facility provides entry into texas  which we believe may provide additional growth opportunities 
in addition to texas  several states including georgia  louisiana  south carolina  north carolina  pennsylvania  virginia and others have indicated a desire to privatize one or more state psychiatric hospitals 
relative to opportunities for community based re entry centers  we expect to compete for several formal solicitations from the bop for re entry centers across the country and are also working with our existing local and state correctional clients to leverage new opportunities for both residential facilities as well as non residential day reporting centers 
we continue to expend resources on informing state and local governments about the benefits of privatization and we anticipate that there will be new opportunities in the future as those efforts begin to yield results 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on any suitable opportunities that become available in this area 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our contracts to provide services to our governmental clients 
labor and related costs represented of our operating expenses in additional significant operating expenses include food  utilities and inmate medical costs 
in  operating expenses totaled of our consolidated revenues 
our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in will be impacted by the activation of any new or existing facilities as a result of the cost of transitioning and or start up operations related to a facility opening 
during  we will incur carrying costs for facilities that are either currently vacant or are expected to become vacant in the carrying costs associated with the approximately  beds we are currently marketing are expected to be million including depreciation expense of million 
we will also experience increases  compared to historical amounts  as a result of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of cornell and bi 
in addition to these factors  we expect to experience overall increases in operating expenses in compared to as a result of a full year of operations relative to bi  which was acquired in february as of january   our worldwide operations included the management and or ownership of approximately  beds at correctional  detention and residential treatment facilities  including idle facilities and projects under development and also included the provision of monitoring of approximately  offenders in a community based environment on behalf of approximately federal  state and local correctional agencies located in all states 
see the discussion below regarding synergies and cost savings 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses 
in  general and administrative expenses totaled of our consolidated revenues 
we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in to decrease as a result of an expected decrease in nonrecurring integration costs related to our acquisitions 
in connection with our merger with cornell  we incurred nonrecurring integration and or transaction costs of million and approximately million  during fiscal years ended and  respectively 
in connection with our acquisition of bi  we incurred nonrecurring integration and or transaction costs of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect business development costs to remain consistent as we pursue additional business development opportunities in all of our business lines and build the corporate infrastructure necessary to support our mental health residential treatment services business 
we also plan to continue expending resources from time to time on the evaluation of potential acquisition targets 
synergies and cost savings our management anticipates annual synergies of approximately million during the year following the full integration of the merger with cornell and approximately million during the year following our acquisition of bi 
there may be potential to achieve additional synergies thereafter 
we believe any such additional synergies would be achieved primarily from greater operating efficiencies  capturing inherent economies of scale and leveraging corporate resources 
any synergies achieved should further enhance cash provided by operations and return on invested capital of the combined company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates with respect to our senior credit facility 
payments under the senior credit facility are indexed to a variable interest rate 
based on borrowings outstanding as of january  under the senior credit facility of million net of discount of million  for every one percent increase in the interest rate applicable to the senior credit facility  our total annual interest expense would increase by million 
as of january   we had four interest rate swap agreements in the aggregate notional amount of million 
these interest rate swaps  which have payment  expiration dates and call provisions that mirror the terms of the senior notes  effectively convert million of the senior notes into variable rate obligations 
under these interest rate swaps  we receive a fixed interest rate payment from the financial counterparties to the agreements equal to per year calculated on the notional million amount  while we make a variable interest rate payment to the same counterparties equal to the three month libor plus a fixed margin of between and  also calculated on the notional million amount 
for every one percent increase in the interest rate applicable to our aggregate notional million of swap agreements relative to the senior notes  our annual interest expense would increase by million 
we have entered into certain interest rate swap arrangements for hedging purposes  fixing the interest rate on our australian non recourse debt to 
the difference between the floating rate and the swap rate on these instruments is recognized in interest expense within the respective entity 
because the interest rates with respect to these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical basis point change in the current interest rate would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  we invest our cash in a variety of short term financial instruments to provide a return 
these instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less 
while these instruments are subject to interest rate risk  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the south african rand and the british pound currency exchange rates 
based upon our foreign currency exchange rate exposure as of january  with respect to our international operations  every percent change in historical currency rates would have a million effect on our financial position and a million impact on our results of operations over the next fiscal year
