item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview murphy oil corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with petroleum marketing operations in the united states and refining and marketing operations in the united kingdom 
a more detailed description of the company s significant assets can be found in item of this form k report 
murphy generates revenue by selling oil and natural gas production to customers in the united states  canada  malaysia  the united kingdom and other countries 
additionally  the company generates revenue by selling refined petroleum and ethanol products at hundreds of locations in the united states and the united kingdom 
the company s revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells 
also  because crude oil is purchased by the company for uk refinery feedstocks  natural gas is purchased for fuel at its uk refinery and at worldwide oil production facilities  and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in the us that are primarily located at walmart supercenters  the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the company s costs 
in order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business  revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products  amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration 
profits and generation of cash in the company s refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins  which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing  transporting and marketing these products 
murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions and note holders 
worldwide oil prices were significantly higher in than  but north american natural gas prices were weaker in than in the prior year 
the sales price for a barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude oil averaged in  in and in the nymex natural gas price per million british thermal units mmbtu averaged in  in and in crude oil prices rose in primarily due to a combination of recovering demand and unrest in the oil rich middle east and northern africa 
while the prices of wti crude oil rose almost compared to the prior year  crude oil sold based on other worldwide benchmark prices  such as brent and tapis  rose even more than wti 
the rise in prices of wti based crude oil  which is only used as a benchmark in north america  was held back in compared to other worldwide benchmark price increases due to a somewhat temporary crude oil dislocation discount and a bit of supply demand disparity in the continental us during the year 
the average price of nymex natural gas was lower in than the disparity between crude oil and natural gas prices in north america continued to widen during compared to an energy equivalent basis of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil due to gas production growth that exceeded demand 
the increase in natural gas production was primarily associated with volumes produced at a number of expanding us unconventional shale gas plays 
natural gas prices in north america have declined further in early due to milder than normal winter temperatures across much of the us crude oil and north american natural gas prices were both higher in than in crude oil prices generally strengthened in as the worldwide economy began to show signs of recovery following the deep recession that began in wti oil prices in averaged higher than  while nymex natural gas prices increased 
changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the company  especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis one barrel of oil equals six thousand cubic feet of natural gas by the company in in  the percentage of hydrocarbon production represented by oil is expected to remain relatively consistent with if the prices for crude oil and natural gas should weaken in or beyond  the company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business 
such lower oil and gas prices could  but may not  have a favorable impact on the company s refining and marketing operating profits 

table of contents results of operations net income in of million per diluted share was better than net income in of million per diluted share 
the improvement in net income in comparison to was primarily attributable to higher oil prices in and stronger us retail marketing and refining margins 
these were mostly offset by an impairment charge of million in to reduce the carrying value of the azurite oil field offshore republic of the congo to fair value 
the net cost of corporate activities not allocated to the operating segments was lower in than in net income in included income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share compared to income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share in the results of discontinued operations in both years are associated with two us refineries and certain associated marketing assets that were sold in income from continuing operations was million per diluted share in compared to million per diluted share in murphy had net income in of million per diluted share  down compared to net income of million per diluted share in net income in included income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share  while had income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share 
the results of discontinued operations in were associated with operating income of the two us refineries and associated marketing assets that were sold in  income from discontinued operations in primarily arose from a million after tax gain on disposal of all ecuador assets in march  but also included operating income of the us refineries and marketing assets sold in income from continuing operations was million per diluted share in and million per diluted share in income in rose for both exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m operations compared to the prior year 
earnings for the company s e p operations increased in primarily due to higher sales prices and sales volumes of crude oil and natural gas 
the company s r m earnings from continuing operations were higher in primarily due to stronger profits on us retail gasoline fuel and merchandise sales 
earnings in were unfavorably affected compared to by higher net costs associated with corporate activities that were not allocated to operating segments  with the higher costs primarily caused by an unfavorable variance for the effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections 
vs 
net income in totaled million per diluted share compared to million per diluted share in these earnings included income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share in compared to income of million per diluted share in discontinued operations in both years were associated with the company s two us refineries which were sold in income from continuing operations amounted to million per diluted share in  down from million per diluted share in the lower earnings from continuing operations in was primarily attributable to a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the azurite oil field  offshore republic of the congo  to fair value 
higher sales prices for worldwide crude oil and sarawak natural gas production and higher us retail marketing profits partially offset the impact of the congo impairment 
e p income in was million lower than  primarily attributable to the million impairment charge at the azurite oil field in republic of the congo 
other unfavorable impacts in included higher dry hole costs compared to  lower crude oil sales volumes  lower north american natural gas sales prices and higher extraction costs for oil and gas produced in e p results in benefited from a higher average sales prices for crude oil produced and a higher sales prices for natural gas produced offshore sarawak  malaysia 
income from r m continuing operations was million higher in compared to  essentially attributable to stronger us retail gasoline marketing margins of more than per gallon and larger profits on sales of merchandise in the us retail marketing business 
the net costs of corporate activities were million less in than primarily due to gains from transactions 
table of contents denominated in foreign currencies in compared to losses on such transactions in during the us dollar generally strengthened in comparison to the malaysian ringgit  which provided a favorable foreign currency impact to the company s earnings due to fewer us dollars being required to pay and future income taxes owed in the local currency 
sales and operating revenues were billion more in than primarily due to higher prices realized on crude oil production and gasoline and other refined products sold by the company 
gain on sale of assets classified in continuing operations was million more in than principally due to a profit on sale of gas storage assets in spain in the current year 
interest and other income loss in was favorable million compared to principally due to improved income effects from transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
additionally  the company collected higher interest income on invested cash balances in primarily due to larger average invested balances during the year 
crude oil and product purchases expense was billion more in than due to higher costs of crude oil feedstocks at the milford haven  wales refinery  higher costs for gasoline purchased for resale in the us retail marketing operations and an increase in volume of merchandise purchased for resale at us retail gasoline stations 
operating expenses in were million more than mostly due to higher costs associated with the company s production of oil and natural gas in  plus higher operating expenses at us retail marketing stations  and higher power and other costs at the milford haven  wales refinery 
exploration expense in was million above primarily due to higher dry hole costs associated with unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities in brunei  indonesia  canada and suriname 
selling and general expenses rose million in compared to primarily due to a combination of higher costs for employee compensation and professional services 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was down million in mostly due to fewer barrels of oil equivalent produced in compared to impairment of long lived assets of million in was attributable to a charge to reduce the net book value of the azurite oil field to fair value 
the charge was necessitated by a reduction of proved oil reserves at this field at year end accretion of asset retirement obligations increased million in  primarily due to future abandonment costs to be incurred on oil and gas development wells drilled in the eagle ford shale and montney areas in  and higher estimated abandonment costs for existing wells in the gulf of mexico and offshore malaysia and for synthetic oil operations at syncrude in western canada 
the income effect of the redetermination of the company s working interest at the terra nova field  offshore eastern canada  was favorable million in compared to the final settlement related to the redetermination was made in early at a net cost to the company that was million less than previously estimated 
the benefit from this reduced settlement payment was recognized in the net cost of million in related to the portion of terra nova s operating results in that were estimated to be owed to other partners upon final settlement 
due to the redetermination process  the company s working interest at terra nova was reduced from to 
interest expense in was million more than primarily due to interest associated with tax reassessments in canada in the most recent year 
interest capitalized to oil and gas development projects in was million below due to cessation of interest capitalized upon commencement of production at the tupper west area in western canada in the first quarter income tax expense was million more in than due to higher pretax income in plus higher exploration and impairment expenses in the year for which no tax benefit was recognizable by the company 
the effective tax rate on a consolidated basis increased from in to in due to a larger percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in and due to higher exploration  impairment and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can presently be recognized due to no assurance that these expenses would be realized in or future years to reduce taxes owed 
the tax rates in both and were higher than the us federal statutory rate of due to a combination of us state income taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceeded the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the company s uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these expenses in or future years 
income from discontinued operations was million higher in than due to stronger us refining margins in prior to the sale of the refineries near the end of the third quarter of additionally  discontinued operations included a pretax gain on sale of the two us refineries of million 

table of contents vs 
net income in was million per diluted share compared to million per diluted share in the and results included income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share and million per diluted share  respectively 
the discontinued operations income in included the operating results of the meraux  louisiana  and superior  wisconsin  refineries and associated marketing assets that were sold in the discontinued operations income included the operating results of these two refineries plus properties in ecuador that were sold in march at an after tax gain of million 
income from continuing operations in and were million per diluted share and million per diluted share  respectively 
the higher income from continuing operations compared to was caused by higher earnings in both the e p and r m businesses  but these were partially offset by higher net costs for unallocated corporate activities 
e p income from continuing operations improved million in  primarily due to a per barrel higher realized sales price for crude oil in the results were impacted by two unusual items 
first  an after tax gain of million in was derived from a recovery of certain deepwater gulf of mexico federal royalties paid in prior years 
second  an after tax charge of million was recorded in associated with a required one time working interest redetermination at the terra nova field  offshore eastern canada 
the e p results were also favorably affected  but in less significant measures  by higher sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas and higher sales prices for natural gas 
e p was unfavorably affected in compared to the prior year by higher expenses for exploration  production  depreciation and administration 
income from r m continuing operations was million more in  with the improvement mostly attributable to slightly more than a per gallon improvement in margins on sale of gasoline at us retail marketing stations 
this was partially offset by higher net losses in for uk r m operations 
the net costs of corporate activities were higher by million in  mostly attributable to unfavorable effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
to a lesser degree  the corporate net costs were unfavorably affected by lower interest income and higher expenses for interest and administration 
the unfavorable variance in foreign currency transactions in was primarily attributable to a strengthening of the malaysian ringgit versus the us dollar and weakening of the british pound sterling against the us dollar during the year 
sales and other operating revenues grew billion in compared to mostly due to higher sales prices for gasoline and other motor fuels in the later year 
additionally  higher sales prices and sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas in the e p segment contributed to the increase in revenue 
gain on sale of assets was million less in than because the earlier year included a million gain on sale of a small canadian natural gas field 
interest and other operating income loss was unfavorable by million in compared to mostly due to a million unfavorable variance from the effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies  plus nonrecurring interest income in of million associated with a recovery of federal royalties paid in prior years for production at certain deepwater gulf of mexico fields 
the expense associated with crude oil and product purchases increased by billion in compared to due to higher average costs for wholesale gasoline and other motor fuels which were purchased for resale at the company s retail fueling stations in the us and us and higher costs for crude oil feedstocks at the company s uk refinery 
operating expenses were million higher in than due to a combination of higher oil and natural gas production costs and higher costs for us retail gasoline station operations 
exploration expenses rose million in compared to due to higher geophysical costs in the gulf of mexico and republic of the congo  higher amortization expense for undeveloped leases in the eagle ford shale  and higher administrative office and study costs in foreign locations 
exploration costs in included lower dry hole costs in malaysia  australia and the us  which more than offset higher dry hole costs in republic of the congo  suriname and the uk selling and general expenses were million more in than in primarily due to higher employee compensation costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense rose million in versus due to higher natural gas and crude oil sales volumes in  higher e p per unit depreciation rates  and higher r m depreciation that included a new ethanol production facility  more us retail gasoline stations in operation and a crude unit expansion at the milford haven  wales  refinery that was completed in impairment of properties was nil in and million in  with the earlier year costs related to write off of an underperforming natural gas field in the gulf of mexico 
accretion of asset retirement 
table of contents obligations was million more in than primarily due to higher discounted abandonment liabilities in for wells drilled in malaysia and for synthetic oil operations at syncrude 
expense for redetermination of working interest at the terra nova field was million less in than because the earlier year included cumulative costs for the period of december through  while costs related only to that year s operations at terra nova 
interest expense was million higher in primarily due to nine months of interest in on nonrecourse debt associated with the hankinson  north dakota  ethanol production facility  compared to three months of interest on this debt in following the october  acquisition date 
the nonrecourse debt was paid off by the company in september the higher nonrecourse debt interest was mostly offset by lower interest expense on outstanding general bank financing balances in capitalized interest was million less in than in the prior year due to interest amounts allocated to the sarawak natural gas development in prior to start up of operations later that year  partially offset by higher interest allocated to the tupper west gas development in income tax expense in was million more than due to higher pretax earnings and a slightly higher overall effective tax rate in the later year 
the consolidated effective tax rate was in compared to in  with the rate increase in the later year caused by a larger percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in and due to higher current year exploration and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can presently be recognized due to no assurance that these expenses will be realized in or future years to reduce taxes owed 
the tax rates in both and were higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to a combination of us state income taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceeded the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the company s uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in or future years 
income from discontinued operations was million per diluted share in and million per diluted share in income from discontinued operations in both years included operating results for the two us petroleum refineries sold in late income from discontinued operations in included an after tax gain of million on ecuador assets which were sold in march segment results in the following table  the company s results of operations for the three years ended december   are presented by segment

table of contents exploration and production earnings from exploration and production e p continuing operations were million in  million in and million in e p income in was million less than in primarily due to a million impairment charge in to reduce the carrying value of the azurite oil field to fair value 
the period also had higher exploration expense  lower crude oil sales volumes and lower north american natural gas sales prices 
but the latest year benefited from higher oil and sarawak natural gas sales prices and higher natural gas sales volumes 
the company s realized crude oil sales prices averaged per barrel more in than north american natural gas sales prices in were per mcf below levels  but natural gas sales prices from fields offshore sarawak were higher in by per mcf 
crude oil  condensate and gas liquids sales volumes were lower in compared to  compared to a decrease in oil production volumes of in oil sales volumes declined more than oil production volumes during primarily due to the timing of scheduling oil sales transactions at the kikeh field offshore malaysia 
sales volumes at kikeh were below production levels in due to an increase in the volume of unsold barrels at the field at the latest year end  while in  kikeh sales volumes exceeded production  which effectively reduced the company s unsold inventory balance from year end us crude oil sales volumes were lower in than principally due to less production at the thunder hawk field in the gulf of mexico 
lower crude oil sales volumes in canada in were mostly attributable to production issues and a lower company working interest percentage in at the terra nova field  but this was partially offset by higher sales volumes at the seal heavy oil field in alberta 
crude oil sales volume in the uk in were below levels primarily due to lower oil volumes produced at the schiehallion and mungo monan fields during the later year 
crude oil sales volumes at kikeh in fell compared to due to lower annual production in caused by well downtime for mechanical issues 
sales of crude oil and condensate increased at fields offshore sarawak in due to higher volumes produced during the year 
crude oil sales volumes in republic of the congo fell in due to production decline at the azurite field 
natural gas sales volumes increased in and the improvement was primarily attributable to higher gas volumes produced during at the tupper west area in western canada following start up in the first quarter of the year 
natural gas sales volumes also improved in at the tupper area in canada and at fields offshore sarawak  both of these areas had active development programs during natural gas sales volumes were lower during at the kikeh field principally due to less volumes produced because of mechanical issues with wells 
income from e p continuing operations in was million more than in the increase was primarily attributable to higher sales prices for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons produced in the company s average realized sales price for crude oil  condensate and gas liquids in increased per barrel over the company s average natural gas sales prices in north america and sarawak malaysia were also higher in than e p income in included a million after tax one time benefit from recovery of previously paid federal royalties associated with certain fields in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico 
although both and had charges associated with a redetermination of working interest at the terra nova field offshore eastern canada  charges were higher by million due to including estimated costs to settle the period from december to  while included only costs for that year s operating activities 
earnings in benefited from higher crude oil and natural sales volumes compared to crude oil and liquids sales volumes increased in while natural gas sales volumes rose 
the increase in hydrocarbon sales volumes in led to higher expenses for production and depreciation of million and million  respectively 
the year also had higher exploration expenses of million compared to  essentially due to higher expenses related to geophysical activities  undeveloped lease amortization and administration  which were somewhat offset by lower expenses for dry holes 
crude oil sales volumes increased in in the us due to a full year of production at the thunder hawk field in the gulf of mexico  this field started producing in july heavy oil sales volumes in canada in were less than due to lower gross production and a higher royalty rate in the seal area of western canada 
oil sales volumes in offshore canada were below levels mostly due to lower gross production at the terra nova field and a higher royalty rate at the hibernia field 
synthetic oil sales at syncrude increased in due to higher gross production compared to sales volumes for crude oil produced in malaysia were lower 
table of contents in due to less production at the kikeh field offshore sabah 
crude oil sold in the uk rose in due to making up for undersold inventory barrels produced in at the schiehallion field 
crude oil sales increased in in republic of the congo due to a full year of production at the azurite field following production start up in august natural gas sales volumes in increased significantly compared to the prior year due to a full year of production and higher daily sales volumes at gas fields which started up in offshore sarawak malaysia  as well as higher sales volumes at the tupper area in western canada 
the results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages f and f of this form k report

a summary of oil and gas revenues  including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  is presented in the following table 
millions of dollars united states oil and gas liquids natural gas canada conventional oil and gas liquids synthetic oil natural gas malaysia oil and gas liquids natural gas united kingdom oil and gas liquids natural gas republic of the congo oil total oil and gas revenues the company s total crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids production from continuing operations  which excludes discontinued operations in ecuador sold in march  averaged  barrels per day in   barrels per day in and  barrels per day in united states oil production decreased from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in with the lower volumes mostly caused by field decline at thunder hawk that was primarily caused by a delay in development drilling operations in and following the macondo incident in april the production decline at thunder hawk was partially offset by higher oil volumes produced in at the eagle ford shale area in south texas 
production of heavy oil in the western canada sedimentary basin was  barrels per day in  up from  barrels per day in  primarily due to ongoing drilling operations at the seal area in alberta 
oil production offshore canada fell from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in primarily due to field decline at terra nova and a reduction of the company s working interest at this field from in to in synthetic oil operations at syncrude had net production of  barrels per day in  up from  barrels per day in  with the increase caused by a lower royalty rate in due to higher costs incurred for the operations 
oil production in malaysia decreased from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  primarily due to lower production at the kikeh field 
sands and other fines produced with the oil at kikeh led to certain wells being down for a portion of oil production in malaysia was favorably affected in by higher condensate and other gas liquids produced at gas fields offshore sarawak 
oil production in the uk was  barrels per day in  down from  barrels per day in  with the decline primarily due to more downtime at the schiehallion and mungo monan fields during 
table of contents the later year 
the azurite field offshore republic of the congo averaged  barrels per day in  down from  barrels per day in due to faster than expected well decline 
united states crude oil production averaged  barrels per day in  up from  barrels per day in the us increase was primarily attributable to a full year of oil production at the thunder hawk field that started up in july in the gulf of mexico 
heavy oil production in western canada declined from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in due to a combination of lower gross production in the seal area plus a higher royalty rate there due to higher sales prices in crude oil production offshore canada fell from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in essentially due to lower production levels at terra nova caused by field decline and a higher royalty rate at hibernia 
synthetic oil production of  barrels per day in exceeded volumes of  per day due to less downtime for maintenance in the later year 
crude oil and liquids production in malaysia averaged  barrels per day in  down from  barrels per day in  with the decrease mainly due to downtime in the later year at kikeh for well maintenance and installation of drilling equipment on the production facility 
crude oil production in the uk in was about flat with as higher production volumes at schiehallion almost offset lower volumes due to well decline at mungo monan 
oil production in republic of the congo rose to  barrels per day in after averaging  barrels per day for all of  the azurite field came on production in august the company sold its interest in block and other areas in ecuador in march and has accounted for ecuador as discontinued operations 
oil production in ecuador  excluded from the totals for continuing operations  averaged  barrels per day in worldwide sales of natural gas were million cubic feet mmcf per day in  mmcf per day in and mmcf per day in natural gas production in the us averaged mmcf per day in  compared to mmcf per day in the lower volume in was primarily attributable to the thunder hawk field where production declined during the year due to delay in development drilling operations following the macondo incident in april natural gas production in canada rose from mmcf per day in to an annual company record of mmcf per day in primarily due to start up of production at the tupper west area in western canada in the first quarter gas sales volumes also increased in at the nearby tupper area due to development drilling activities during the year 
natural gas production in malaysia rose to mmcf per day in compared to mmcf per day in natural gas sales volumes during at sarawak and kikeh averaged mmcf per day and mmcf per day  respectively 
gas sales rose mmcf per day at sarawak due to higher demand from the local purchaser  while kikeh gas volumes fell mmcf per day in due to lower demand and wells down for mechanical repairs for a portion of the year 
natural gas production in the uk fell from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in primarily due to more downtime for repairs at the amethyst field during the just completed year 
natural gas sales volumes in the us were mmcf per day in  down from production of mmcf per day as higher production at thunder hawk in the gulf of mexico and the eagle ford shale area did not fully offset declines at fields onshore south louisiana and at other fields in the gulf of mexico 
natural gas volumes in western canada increased from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in essentially due to continued ramp up of tupper area production during the later year 
natural gas sales volumes in malaysia increased in for both the sarawak and sabah offshore areas 
sarawak production rose to mmcf per day in following volumes of mmcf per day in sarawak gas production began in september and as such was on production for all of versus four months in the company also continued ramp up of new wells at sarawak gas fields during gas sales at the kikeh field averaged mmcf per day in  up from mmcf per day the prior year 
natural gas sales volumes in the uk increased from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in as gas volumes rose at both the mungo monan and amethyst fields during the later year 
the company s average worldwide realized sales price for crude oil  condensate and gas liquids from continuing operations was per barrel in compared to per barrel in and per barrel in 
table of contents the company s average realized oil sales price of in was an increase of compared to the average price of west texas intermediate wti crude oil rose during the company s average oil price increased more than wti because other worldwide benchmark prices rose more than wti during dated brent prices  for example  rose during additionally  the company s realized sales price in malaysia in and a portion of benefited from a switch to the brent benchmark price during the prior year 
crude oil prices strengthened in due to an improvement in energy demand in association with a slowly recovering worldwide economy and unrest in northern africa and the middle east during that caused concern in the oil markets about the potential for supply disruptions 
compared to  the company s average crude oil sales prices in the us rose to per barrel  heavy oil prices in canada sold for more and averaged per barrel  offshore canada prices increased to per barrel  synthetic crude oil sold for more at per barrel  crude oil in malaysia was up and averaged per barrel  uk crude oil production sold for more at per barrel  and crude oil in republic of the congo sold at per barrel in  an increase of from the average realized crude oil sales price increased in compared to the higher price for was slightly below the increase in wti sales price between the years 
other benchmark oil prices used for sale of company crude oil did not increase at the same rate as wti 
the increase in the sales price for appi tapis based crude oil during did not keep pace with the increase in the wti price due to differences in market conditions in asia versus the us during most of  the company sold its kikeh crude oil based on the appi tapis benchmark price 
in late  the company began to sell its kikeh crude oil based on a brent crude oil benchmark 
compared to  the company s average crude oil sales prices rose in the us to average per barrel  heavy oil sales prices in canada rose to an average of per barrel  offshore canada oil sold at per barrel  an increase of  canadian synthetic crude oil sold for more and averaged per barrel  crude oil produced in malaysia increased to an average price of per barrel  uk crude oil prices increased to per barrel  and crude oil sold in republic of the congo increased only to per barrel as the only sale in was near the end of the year when prices were above the average 
the company s natural gas sales prices in north america in did not generally increase in concert with crude oil prices 
a growing gas supply from unconventional sources such as shale operations kept gas prices in check during the latest year 
the company s average realized north american natural gas sales price was per thousand cubic feet mcf in  a decline of from the per mcf realized in natural gas produced in offshore sarawak was sold at an average price of per mcf  an increase of from the per mcf realized during in the uk the average sales price rose from per mcf in to per mcf in  up in the current year 
virtually all natural gas prices showed improvements in compared to the prices for natural gas generally rose in in sympathy with the increase in average crude oil prices during the same period 
the company s average sales prices for natural gas in north america increased to per mcf in natural gas produced offshore sarawak sold for more in than in and averaged per mcf in the later year 
natural gas produced in the uk sold at an average of per mcf in  a increase from based on sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each per barrel and per mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production continuing operations by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the company s refining and marketing segments could be affected differently 

table of contents production expenses from continuing operations were  million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
costs per equivalent barrel during the last three years are shown in the following table 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil malaysia united kingdom republic of the congo worldwide excluding synthetic oil production expense per equivalent barrel in the us increased in compared to due to lower volumes produced at the thunder hawk field and higher facility rental costs in the early days of the eagle ford shale operation as production ramped up 
the per unit cost for canadian conventional oil and gas operations  excluding synthetic oil  was slightly higher in compared to as the benefit of significantly higher natural gas production at tupper west and tupper was more than offset by lower production volumes without a comparable reduction in costs at hibernia and terra nova 
higher cost per barrel in compared to at canadian synthetic oil operations was mostly caused by higher overall maintenance and fuel costs 
production cost per unit in malaysia was higher in compared to primarily at kikeh caused by higher costs for the work program to address equipment damaged by sand produced with the oil and the associated downtime which led to lower oil production 
higher per barrel production expense in the uk in compared to was primarily attributable to lower production levels at all fields and extended maintenance work 
production expense in republic of the congo was lower on a per unit basis in compared to due to lower gross costs incurred at the azurite field in the later year 
production expense per equivalent barrel in the us increased in compared to due to a larger proportion of production in the later year coming from the higher cost thunder hawk field in the gulf of mexico 
cost per barrel for canada conventional oil and gas operations  excluding synthetic oil  was lower in than due to a larger portion of total hydrocarbons produced coming from the tupper gas area  but this was partially offset by higher unit costs for offshore operations at hibernia and terra nova 
the increase in production costs per barrel for synthetic oil operations in compared to was caused by higher maintenance and natural gas costs in the current year 
production expense in malaysia rose in compared to as higher well maintenance and workover costs at kikeh were only partially offset by a higher proportion of lower cost natural gas produced at fields offshore sarawak 
production expense in in the uk on a per unit basis was lower than due to less repair costs at schiehallion and higher natural gas production at amethyst 
per unit production expense in in republic of the congo was less than in due to higher production levels associated with ramp up of the azurite field  which came onstream in august exploration expenses from continuing operations for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f on this form k report 
expenses other than leasehold amortization are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars dry holes geological and geophysical other undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses 
table of contents dry hole expense was million higher in than due to more unsuccessful exploratory drilling results in the current year  with the most significant areas including brunei  indonesia  southern alberta and suriname 
lower dry hole costs in in malaysia  republic of the congo and the uk somewhat offset the higher costs noted above 
geological and geophysical g g expenses were million higher in compared to the increase in g g expenses in was attributable to higher spending on seismic in brunei  the kurdistan region of iraq  block h malaysia and cameroon  but the current year included lower seismic spending in republic of the congo 
other exploration costs were million more in than mostly due to higher office costs allocable to exploration activities in brunei  indonesia and iraq  and an exploration well drilling penalty in southern alberta 
undeveloped leasehold amortization expense was million higher in than mostly due to lease costs associated with concessions in the kurdistan region of iraq  but partially offset by slightly lower amortization costs in for eagle ford shale leases in south texas and the montney area of western canada 
dry hole expense was million lower in than in despite a increase in spending for exploratory drilling 
dry hole expense in the us was lower in mostly due to deferral of planned gulf of mexico drilling due to the moratorium imposed by the federal government following the april blowout and oil spill at the macondo well owned by other companies 
malaysian operations had lower dry hole expense in due to more successful exploratory drilling results and favorable adjustments to final costs on prior year wells 
dry holes in the uk in primarily related to a decision to expense a well drilled in for which studies in indicated a lack of economical development options based on current pricing levels 
dry hole expense in republic of the congo was higher in than due to drilling more unsuccessful wells in the mps block in the later year 
dry hole expense in in other foreign areas was less than in primarily due to an unsuccessful well offshore australia in g g expenses were million higher in than areas of higher spending on seismic in the year included the eagle ford shale area of south texas  the mpn and mps blocks offshore republic of the congo  and offshore malaysia 
these higher g g costs in were somewhat offset by lower spending in the tupper area of western canada and offshore suriname 
other exploration costs in were million above levels primarily due to higher administrative costs for operations in suriname  indonesia and australia in undeveloped leasehold amortization expense rose million in compared to  primarily due to higher amortization associated with lease acquisition costs in the eagle ford shale area of south texas  partially offset by less amortization expense in following sanction of development at the tupper west property in august the company recorded a million impairment charge in to reduce the carrying value of the azurite oil field  offshore republic of the congo  to fair value 
the impairment charge at azurite was necessitated by a reduction in the field s proved oil reserves at year end due to poor well performance 
an impairment charge of million was recorded in to write off the remaining costs of a poorly performing natural gas field in the gulf of mexico 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for exploration and production operations totaled million in   million in and million in the million decrease in compared to was primarily attributable to lower overall levels of hydrocarbon volumes sold  somewhat offset by a slightly higher per barrel depreciation rate based on a change in the mix of production between and the million increase in compared to was primarily caused by higher overall volumes of oil and natural gas sold during additionally  a higher proportion of production was derived from fields brought onstream in recent years under a higher cost development environment 
the exploration and production business recorded expenses of million in  million in and million in for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities 
because the abandonment liability is carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value  accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment 
the million increase in accretion costs in compared to was attributable to a higher number of wells drilled in the current year in the eagle ford shale and montney areas and higher overall future estimated abandonment cost liabilities for gulf of 
table of contents mexico wells and synthetic oil operations at syncrude 
the million increase in accretion expense in compared to was due to additional wells drilled during the later year in several geographical areas and higher estimated abandonment costs for offshore operations in malaysia and for syncrude synthetic oil operations 
the effective income tax rate for exploration and production continuing operations was in  in and in the effective tax rate was significantly higher in than due to no tax benefit recorded on the impairment charge for the azurite field and higher exploration and administrative expenses in certain foreign tax jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be currently recognized due to lack of sufficient revenue to realize a current or future benefit 
income tax expense in was reduced by a million benefit for expenses incurred in prior years in block p  malaysia 
it was determined during that these expenses in block p are deductible against taxable income generated in block k malaysia 
also  in  the uk government enacted a supplemental tax on oil and gas company profits in that country 
this tax increase raised the company s tax expense in by million  primarily to increase the recorded balance for deferred income taxes that will be paid in future years at the new higher rate 
the effective tax rate is now in the uk the overall effective income tax rate was slightly higher in than mostly due to tax barrels owed the government of republic of the congo under the production sharing agreement covering the azurite field 
more tax barrels were owed the government due to higher azurite production levels in the effective tax rates in all three years exceeded the us statutory tax rate of due to higher overall foreign tax rates and exploration and other expenses in areas where current tax benefits cannot be recorded by the company 
tax jurisdictions with no current tax benefit on expenses primarily include certain non revenue generating areas in malaysia  suriname  australia  indonesia  brunei  cameroon and the kurdistan region of iraq 
each main exploration area in malaysia is currently considered a distinct taxable entity and expenses in certain areas may not be used to offset revenues generated in other areas 
no tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for block h  offshore sabah  and blocks pm  offshore peninsula malaysia 
at december   million barrels of the company s us proved oil reserves and billion cubic feet of us proved natural gas reserves were undeveloped 
more than of the total us undeveloped reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis are associated with the company s eagle ford shale operations in south texas 
further drilling and facility construction are generally required to move the undeveloped reserves in the eagle ford shale area to developed 
in the western canadian sedimentary basin  total proved undeveloped natural gas reserves totaled billion cubic feet  with the migration of these reserves  primarily in the tupper and tupper west areas  dependent on both development drilling and completion of processing and transportation facilities 
in block k malaysia  all oil reserves of million barrels for the kakap field are undeveloped pending completion of facilities and development drilling directed by another company 
additionally  the kikeh field had undeveloped oil reserves of million barrels  which are subject to further development drilling before being moved to developed 
also in malaysia  there were billion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves at various fields offshore sarawak at year end  which were held under this category pending completion of development drilling and facilities 
the deepwaters of the gulf of mexico and the schiehallion field in the uk north sea accounted for additional proved undeveloped reserves of million and million equivalent barrels of oil  respectively  at december  on a worldwide basis  the company spent approximately billion in  billion in and billion in to develop proved reserves 
refining and marketing the company s refining and marketing r m operations generated earnings from continuing operations of million in  million in and million in the r m earnings improvement of million in compared to was mostly attributable to a per gallon improvement in retail fuel marketing sales margin in the us and higher profits on merchandise sales at us retail stations in the r m earnings increase of million in compared to was driven primarily by a per gallon improvement in sales margin for retail fuel  partially offset by lower refining margins in the uk in compared to the prior year

us profits in included higher income from the company s ethanol production facilities compared to the hankinson plant operated for both years while the hereford plant was open for most of only 
corn costs were higher in compared to  but this increase was essentially offset by higher sales prices for ethanol and by products  dried distillers grains and wet distillers grains  in the current year 
united states r m profits from continuing operations increased million in compared to the increase was due to a per gallon higher fuel margin compared to in the retail marketing business 
the retail marketing business had slightly lower volumes sold in compared to fuel margins in the retail chain were hurt in by both lower demand for gasoline and diesel due to the weak economy and generally rising wholesale fuel costs caused by crude oil prices that rose gradually during the year 
united states refined product sales volumes including discontinued operations averaged  barrels per day in  compared to  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in the decrease in was primarily due to the sale of the two us refineries near the end of september  plus lower gasoline volumes sold through the us retail marketing business

foreign currency transaction effects in the uk were also favorable in compared to the prior year 
the corporate area also benefited in from higher interest income of million compared to  principally due to higher levels of invested cash earning interest during the current year 
net interest expense  after capitalization of finance related costs to development projects  was million higher in than this unfavorable variance was principally due to interest charged on certain tax assessments in canada and lower amounts of interest capitalized to development projects in the latest year  primarily at the tupper west area development in western canada where gas production started up in the first quarter of administrative expenses associated with corporate activities were also higher in compared to  primarily associated with additional costs for compensation and professional services

the company had after tax losses from foreign currency exchange of million in  while had after tax gains of million 
the foreign currency exchange loss in was primarily associated with a stronger malaysian ringgit compared to the us dollar 
this led to costs associated with higher recorded future income tax liabilities  which are required to be paid in local currency 
foreign currency exchange losses were also experienced in the uk during caused by a stronger uk dollar compared to the british pound sterling 
this led to higher costs for us dollar denominated liabilities owed by the company s us refining and marketing business  which has a sterling functional currency 
additionally  benefited from interest income of million associated with a recovery of federal royalties previously paid on certain deepwater gulf of mexico oil and natural gas production 
net interest expense  after capitalization of finance related costs to development projects  was million higher in than mostly due to lower interest capitalized on oil and natural gas development projects during corporate activities had higher administrative and depreciation expenses in than in of million and million  respectively  compared to the increase in administrative expense in was primarily associated with higher employee compensation costs

environmental matters murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations dealing with the environment 
virtually all operations of the company are affected by laws and regulations covering environmental  health and safety matters 
compliance with existing and anticipated environmental regulations affects murphy s overall cost of business  including capital costs to construct  
table of contents maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities  and operating costs for ongoing environmental compliance 
murphy s competitive position may be impacted to the extent that regulatory requirements with respect to a particular production technology may give rise to costs that competitors might not bear 
environmental regulations have historically been subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities and these are expected to continue to evolve in the foreseeable future 
the company is unable to predict the ongoing cost of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of such regulations on its operations 
violation of federal or state environmental laws  regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and construction bans or delays 
a discharge of hazardous substances into the environment could  to the extent such event is not insured  subject murphy to substantial expense  including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations and claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for any personal injury and property damage that might result 
murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations  and such capital expenditures were million in and are projected to be million in the sale of us refineries in will reduce future capital expenditures required to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting murphy s operations are the us clean air act  which regulates air emissions the us clean water act  which regulates discharges into us waters the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases the us federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which regulates solid waste and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal 
the us federal oil pollution act of opa  which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the united states the u 
s safe drinking water act  which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground injection wells the federal water pollution control act of fwpca also addressing discharge of pollutants into navigable waters the department of the interior governing offshore oil and gas operations 
the european union regulation for registration  evaluation  authorization and restriction of chemicals reach the european union trading directive resulting in european emissions trading scheme these laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of air  water and solid waste discharges 
they also generally require permits for new or modified operations 
many states and foreign countries where the company operates also have or are in the process of developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water as well as the characteristics and composition of refined products  which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements 
murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations  including legal and administrative proceedings  governing remediation of wastes or oil spills from current and past operations  which include but may not be limited to leaks from pipelines  underground storage tanks and general environmental operations 
murphy is actively engaged in the legislative and regulatory process  both nationally and internationally  in response to climate change issues and environmental and health related matters 

table of contents murphy s environmental  health  and safety committee  a standing committee of the board of directors  was created to oversee and monitor the company s environmental  health  and safety ehs policies and practices 
in february  the board approved a worldwide environmental  health  and safety policy the ehs policy  which is available on the company s web site 
in addition to requiring that the company comply with all applicable ehs laws and regulations  the ehs policy includes a directive that the company will continue to minimize the impact of its operations  products and services on the environment by implementing economically feasible projects that promote energy efficiency and use natural resources effectively 
cercla cercla commonly referred to as the superfund act  and comparable state statutes  primarily address historic contamination and impose joint and several liability upon potentially responsible parties prp  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
cleanup of contaminated sites is the responsibility of the owners and operators of the sites that released  disposed  or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
cercla requires reporting to the national response center for releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous or extremely hazardous if the released quantities exceed an epa established reportable level 
cercla also authorizes the us environmental protection agency epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible persons 
in the course of ordinary operations  the company generates waste that falls within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
murphy may be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of the costs required to remediate sites at which such hazardous substances have been disposed of or released into the environment 
the epa currently considers murphy to be a prp at one superfund site 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at this site may be substantial 
however  based on current negotiations and available information  the company believes that it is a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at the superfund site and as such  it has not recorded a liability for remedial costs 
the company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at this site or other superfund sites 
the company believes that its share of the ultimate costs to remediate this superfund site will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
waste the company currently owns or leases  and has in the past owned or leased  properties at which hazardous substances have been or are being handled 
although the company has used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by the company or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under murphy s control 
these properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under such laws murphy could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
while some of these historical properties are in various stages of negotiation  investigation  and or cleanup  murphy is investigating the extent of any such liability and the availability of applicable defenses  including state funding for remediation  and believe costs related to these sites will not have a material adverse affect on its net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
although certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered from other sources  no assurance can be given that future recoveries from these sources will occur 
therefore  the company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries as of december  rcra and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of solid wastes  with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment  storage or disposal of hazardous wastes 
murphy generates 
table of contents non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of rcra and comparable state statutes 
the company s operating sites also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
the costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
however  it is possible that additional wastes  which could include wastes currently generated during operations  will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes 
hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes 
such changes in the regulations could result in additional capital expenditures and operating expenses 
water under opa  owners and operators of tankers  owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the united states 
the company is not aware of opa claims made against murphy 
each murphy offshore facility in the gulf of mexico has in place an emergency evacuation plan eep and all such facilities are covered by an oil spill response plan osrp 
in the event of an explosion  personnel would be evacuated immediately in accordance with the eep 
the appropriate osrp would be activated if needed 
in the event of an oil spill or containment event  the appropriate osrp and containment plan would be executed as needed 
the eep is approved by the us coast guard uscg and the osrp and containment plan are approved by the bureau of ocean energy management boem 
the company also has comprehensive emergency and spill response plans for offshore facilities in international waters 
murphy s osrp utilizes a consortium of seasoned and well equipped contract service companies to provide response equipment and personnel 
one company has been contracted to provide spill containment and recovery equipment  including skimmers  boom  and vessels such as fast response boats and high volume open sea skimmer barges 
this company has hired other companies to store and maintain response equipment and provide certified tanks and barges 
murphy is a founding member of marine preservation association  which provides access to marine spill response corporation assets to support marine spills in the gulf of mexico and other offshore areas 
additionally  murphy has an agreement with another company to provide aerial dispersant spraying services  and has further contracted with another company to utilize their equipment for oil containment should a well blowout occur 
the federal water pollution control act of fwpca imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters 
the fwpca imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation and damages 
murphy maintains wastewater discharge permits for its facilities where required pursuant to the fwpca and comparable state laws 
murphy has also applied for all necessary permits to discharge storm water under such laws 
the company believes that compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
murphy utilizes hydraulic fracturing technology for its exploration and production activities in canada and the us murphy is actively engaged in exploration and production in the eagle ford shale play in south texas 
on january   the texas railroad commission finalized a rule that requires oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals and amount of water used in hydraulic fracturing of wells 
air murphy s us operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state and local statutes 
the company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with these statutes in all states in which it operates 
amendments to the federal clean air act enacted in required most refining operations in the us to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the epa and state environmental agencies 

table of contents under the epa s clean air act authority  the national petroleum refinery npr initiative global consent decree was used by the epa to undertake at virtually all us refineries an investigation of four marquee compliance areas  including i new source review prevention of significant deterioration for fluidized catalytic cracking units  heaters and boilers  ii new source performance standards for flares  sulfur recovery units  fuel gas combustion devices including heaters and boilers  iii leak detection and repair requirements  and iv benzene national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants 
murphy began negotiations with the epa in  but was interrupted by the events of hurricane katrina 
the states of louisiana and wisconsin are both parties to the npr 
negotiations with epa resumed in and were essentially completed in under the global consent decree  the company paid a fine of million and committed to certain future capital improvements 
the company sold its two us refineries in the european union has adopted an emissions trading scheme in response to the kyoto protocol in order to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
murphy s refinery at milford haven  wales  currently has the most exposure to these requirements and may require purchase of emission allowances to maintain compliance with environmental permit requirements 
these environmental expenditures are expensed as incurred 
in  murphy was notified by the environment agency ea that it failed to surrender proper emission allowances  which murphy self reported to the ea in the company is evaluating all available options regarding this matter 
climate change currently  various national and international legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxides are in various phases of discussion or implementation 
these include a promulgated epa regulation  mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases for numerous industrial business segments  including refineries and offshore production  which became effective december  these were followed by a more recent regulation requiring mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases for petroleum and natural gas systems  including onshore exploration and production facilities  which became effective december  and was revised december  during  us federal legislation epa s greenhouse gas endangerment finding  epa s prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule  low carbon fuel standards  etc 
and various state actions were proposed finalized to develop statewide or regional programs  each of which have or could impose mandatory reductions and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
murphy believes it has met all of the epa required reporting deadlines and strives to ensure accurate and consistent emissions data reporting 
the impact of existing and pending climate change legislation  regulations  international treaties and accords could result in increased costs to the company to i operate and maintain facilities  ii install new emission controls on facilities  and iii administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions trading program 
these actions could also impact the consumption of refined products  thereby affecting gasoline and ethanol marketing operations 
the physical impacts of climate change present potential risks for severe weather floods  hurricanes  tornadoes  etc 
at certain of the company s refined product terminals in the us and its offshore platforms in the gulf of mexico 
commensurate with this risk is the possibility of indirect financial and operational impacts to the company from disruptions to the operations of major customers or suppliers caused by severe weather 
the company has repositioned itself to take advantage of potential climate change opportunities by acquiring renewable energy sources through the acquisition of two ethanol production facilities  thereby achieving a lower carbon footprint and an enhanced capability to meet governmental fuel standards 
the company is unable to predict at this time how much the cost of compliance with any future legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions  or the cost impact of natural catastrophic events resulting from climate change  if it occurs  will be in future periods 
the company recognizes the importance of environmental stewardship as a core component of its mission as a responsible international energy company and has implemented sufficient disclosure controls and procedures to capture and process environmental  safety and climate change related information 
as a companion to murphy s ehs policy  the company s web site also contains a statement on climate change 
not only does this statement 
table of contents on climate change include murphy s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions on an absolute basis while growing its upstream and certain downstream operations  the information on the company s web site describes actions already taken to move towards that goal 
these efforts include incorporating climate change into the company s planning processes  reducing emissions  pursuing new opportunities and engaging legislative and regulatory entities externally 
in support of these efforts  worldwide greenhouse gas inventories have been conducted since additionally  murphy participates in the massachusetts institute of technology mit joint program on the science and policy of global change 
the initiatives cited above demonstrate the company s commitment regarding environmental issues  which are at the forefront of today s global public policy dialogue 
other matters the energy independence and security act eisa was signed into law in december the eisa  through epa regulation  requires refiners and gasoline blenders to obtain renewable fuel volume or representative trading credits as a percentage of their finished product production 
eisa greatly increases the renewable fuels obligation defined in the renewable fuels standard rfs which began in september murphy is actively blending renewable fuel volumes through its retail and wholesale operations and trading corresponding credits known as renewable identification numbers rins to meet most of its obligation 
on july   the rfs standard came into effect requiring the blending phase in of ethanol  biodiesel  cellulosic and advanced renewable fuels 
murphy is meeting its obligations for rfs primarily through the rins system 
the company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in its operations 
under murphy s accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed routinely 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
safety matters the company is subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in murphy s operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
the company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 
other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which are often affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
prices for oil field goods and services have generally risen with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant at times during the last few years primarily driven by high demand for such goods and services when oil and gas prices were strong 
as noted earlier  oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile over the last several years 
oil prices were very strong in early to mid  then fell precipitously in late and into early  then have generally strengthened since that time 
the prices for oil field goods and services 
table of contents generally rise in periods of higher oil prices and do not usually decline as significantly as oil and gas prices in a lower price environment 
should oil prices continue to rise in future periods  the company anticipates that prices for certain oil field equipment and services could rise sharply 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services 
accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements the company adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb regarding accounting for transfers of financial assets effective january  this guidance makes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity as defined previously no longer relevant for accounting purposes 
therefore  formerly qualifying special purpose entities were reevaluated for consolidation by reporting entities in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance 
this adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted  effective january   guidance issued by the fasb that requires a company to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses of the entity or the right to receive potentially significant benefits from the entity 
a company is required to make ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
this guidance also amended previous guidance for determining whether an entity is considered a variable interest entity 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued accounting guidance that expanded the disclosure requirements about financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses 
this guidance became effective for the company at december  because the company has no significant financing receivables that extend beyond one year  the impact of this guidance did not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statement disclosures 
the us securities and exchange commission sec adopted revisions to oil and natural gas reserves reporting requirements which were effective for the company at year end in january  the fasb issued guidance that aligned its oil and gas reserves reporting requirements and effective date with the sec s guidance 
the primary changes to reserves reporting included a revised definition of proved reserves  including the use of unweighted average oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month during the year to compute such reserves  expanding the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include non traditional and unconventional resources  which includes the company s canadian synthetic oil operations at syncrude  allowing companies to voluntarily disclose probable and possible reserves in sec filings  amending required proved reserve disclosures to include separate amounts for synthetic oil and gas  expanded disclosures of proved undeveloped reserves  including discussion of such proved undeveloped reserves five years old or more  and disclosure of the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the company s overall reserve process 
the company utilized the new sec and fasb guidance at december   and to determine its proved reserves and to develop associated disclosures 
the company chose not to provide voluntary disclosures of probable and possible reserves in this form k 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that simplifies the annual goodwill impairment assessment process by permitting a company to assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 

table of contents if a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the company would be required to conduct the current two step goodwill impairment test 
this change is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning in early adoption is permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of this standard in to have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that only permits two options for presentation of comprehensive income 
comprehensive income can be presented in a a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  including total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income  or b in two separate but continuous statements for the statement of income and the statement of comprehensive income 
the new guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of as in prior years  the company expects to continue to present the statements of income and comprehensive income in two separate statements  and the adoption of this guidance in is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb deferred the requirement for reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to be measured and presented by line item in the statements of income and comprehensive income 
the united states congress passed the dodd frank act in among other requirements  the law requires companies in the oil and gas industry to disclose payments made to the us federal and all foreign governments 
the sec was directed to develop the reporting requirements in accordance with the law 
the sec has issued preliminary guidance and has received feedback thereon from interested parties 
the preliminary rules indicated that payment disclosures would be required at a project level within the annual form k report beginning with the year ending december  the sec has not issued final guidance regarding required disclosure 
therefore  it is expected that reporting will be delayed beyond year end the company cannot predict the final disclosure requirements that will be required by the sec 
significant accounting policies in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires significant estimates 
the most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below 
proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves are defined by the sec as those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic method or probabilistic method is used for the estimation 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well  or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
sec rules require that we use an unweighted average of the oil and gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year for determining proved reserve quantities 
these historical prices often do not approximate the average price that the company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production in the future 
the company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations 
estimated reserves are subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and gas prices can 
table of contents lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the company s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations 
downward reserve revisions can also lead to significant impairment expense 
the company cannot predict the type of oil and natural gas reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
the company s proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages f and f of this form k 
murphy has utilized reliable geologic and engineering technology in to include proved undeveloped reserves more than one location from producing wells in the more developed portions of the eagle ford shale 
the study incorporated public and proprietary data from multiple sources and encompassed the entire basin 
this included analysis of seismic data  well log data  test production and fluids properties to establish geologic consistency as well as significant statistical performance data yielding predictable and repeatable reserve estimates within certain analogous areas 
these locations were limited to only those areas with both established geologic consistency and sufficient statistical performance data where such data could be demonstrated to provide reasonable certain results 
oil proved reserves revisions positive proved oil reserve revisions in the us in were primarily associated with better production at the medusa field in the gulf of mexico 
positive oil revisions for canada conventional operations were mostly attributable to better well performance at the hibernia field  offshore eastern canada 
synthetic oil operations had positive reserve revisions in due to change in royalty rate 
positive oil revisions in in malaysia were primarily at the kikeh field caused by production performance 
positive oil revisions in the uk in were associated with the schiehallion field which is being redeveloped by its owners 
the negative revision in oil reserves in republic of the congo in was attributable to poor production results for wells in the field 
the positive revision in us proved oil reserves in was primarily associated with better than anticipated performance of wells at the thunder hawk and medusa fields in the gulf of mexico 
better well performance at the hibernia and terra nova fields led to favorable proved oil reserve revisions in canada in proved oil reserves for canadian synthetic oil operations had a positive revision in primarily due to a lower royalty 
the positive proved oil reserve revision in malaysia in primarily related to better well performance at the kikeh field 
a positive proved oil reserve revision in republic of the congo in was attributable to improved terms under the production sharing agreement that allocated a larger share of production at the azurite field to the account of the company beginning in october a favorable oil reserve revision in in the united states was attributable to favorable performance of the thunder hawk and front runner fields and federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields 
a favorable conventional oil revision in canada in was caused by performance of the terra nova field and improved heavy oil pricing which added reserves in the seal area 
due to changes in the sec s definition of proved oil reserves  which were first effective as of december   synthetic oil reserves are now included as proved oil reserves 
consequently  total synthetic oil reserves as of january  of million barrels were added to total oil reserves in the positive revision to synthetic oil reserves during was attributable to lower royalties compared to a year earlier 
an unfavorable revision to oil reserves in malaysia in was due to current year drilling results for a well in the kikeh field  along with reduced entitlements at kikeh and west patricia due to increased prices in compared to year end oil reserves in the uk reflected an unfavorable revision in because of an anticipated reduction in life expectancy for major equipment at the schiehallion project 
natural gas proved reserves revisions proved natural gas reserves in the us had negative revisions in due to well performance being less than expected in early wells drilled in the gas prone regions of the eagle ford shale in south texas 
positive gas reserve revisions in canada in were primarily at the tupper and tupper west areas and these were based on better than anticipated well performance 
negative gas reserve revisions in malaysia in were primarily due to higher sales prices which effectively reduced the entitlement percentage for 
table of contents future production at the sarawak gas fields 
negative gas reserve revisions in the uk in were essentially caused by revised estimate of gas cap volumes at the mungo monan field 
proved natural gas reserves in the us had positive revisions in due to better well performance at the thunder hawk and mondo fields in the gulf of mexico 
the positive gas reserve revision in canada in was attributable to performance at various wells in the tupper area of british columbia 
proved reserves of natural gas in malaysia were revised downward in due to higher prices leading to a lower future entitlement percentage for the company 
positive gas reserve revisions in the uk in were attributable to better well performance at all gas producing fields 
in  a positive us gas reserve revision was caused by favorable performance of the thunder hawk  front runner and mondo nw fields as well as federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields 
in malaysia  a combination of increased entitlements due to pricing and drilling performance at the sarawak gas project led to positive gas revisions in gas reserves in the uk were favorably revised in because of the amethyst field gas compression project and better mungo field performance 
successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 
in some cases  a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves cannot be made immediately 
this is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon s found 
the determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is  in turn  usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves 
under current accounting rules  the company holds well costs in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked  dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred 
in  a dry hole was recorded for a well drilled in republic of the congo in a significant reduction in proved oil reserves at the azurite field in the same mps block during reduced the likelihood of this well being produced in future years 
in  a dry hole was recorded for a well in the north sea that was drilled in extensive evaluations of this oil discovery determined in that recovery of hydrocarbons was not economical in the current price environment 
there were no dry holes in that were drilled in prior years 
impairment of long lived assets the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment and goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  future capital and abandonment costs  future margins on refined products produced and sold  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable reserve revisions  expected deterioration of future refining and or marketing margins for refined products  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a property s carrying value for possible impairment 
in making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment  the company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices  future 
table of contents production volumes  and future capital and operating costs 
due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets  the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the company s projections 
estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves 
although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  however  there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection 
the company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available 
the company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations 
although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable  at times  costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated 
in assessing potential impairment involving refining and marketing assets  the company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events  which include projections of future margins  future capital expenditures and future operating expenses 
future marketing or operating decisions  such as closing or selling certain assets  and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the company s conclusion about potential asset impairment 
impairment expense of million was recognized in to reduce the carrying value of the azurite oil field  offshore republic of the congo  to fair value 
the expense was necessitated by a significant year end reduction of proved reserves at this field which was caused by poor well performance 
additionally  an impairment expense of million was recorded in to write off the remaining carrying value of one underperforming natural gas field in the gulf of mexico 
based on an evaluation of expected future cash flows from properties at year end  the company does not believe it had any other significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at that date 
the expected future sales prices for crude oil and natural gas used in the evaluation were based on quoted future prices for the respective production periods 
these quoted prices often reflect higher expected prices for oil and natural gas in the future compared to the existing spot prices at the time of assessment 
if quoted prices for future years had been lower  the smaller projected cash flows for properties could have led to significant impairment charges being recorded for certain properties in in addition  one or a combination of factors such as lower future sales prices  lower future production  higher future costs  lower future margins on refining and marketing sales  or the actions of government authorities could lead to impairment expenses in future periods 
based on these unknown future factors as described herein  the company cannot predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to basis differences for property  equipment and inventories  and dismantlements and retirement benefit plan liabilities 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
a valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for blocks h and pm in malaysia and blocks mps and mpn in republic of the congo  for exploration licenses in certain areas  the largest of which are australia  suriname  indonesia and brunei  and for certain basis differences in the uk due to management s belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities  gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 
accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans murphy oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees 
the company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired us employees 
the expense 
table of contents associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries 
the most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
for the retiree medical and insurance plans  the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate 
discount rates are based on the universe of high quality corporate bonds that are available within each country 
cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans 
the discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country 
expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics 
anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs 
based on bond yields at year end  the company has used a discount rate of at year end and beyond for the primary us plans 
although the company presently assumes a return on plan assets of for the primary us plan  it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions 
the smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current year s pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset valuations 
the company s normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses are expected to increase slightly in compared to based on the effects of a growing employee base 
in  the company paid million into various retirement plans and million into postretirement plans 
in  the company is expecting to fund payments of approximately million into various retirement plans and million for postretirement plans 
the company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years 
future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines  the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed return  or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected 
as described above  the company s retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions  primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets 
a decline in the discount rate would increase annual retirement and postretirement expenses by million and million  respectively  and a decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase retirement expense by million 
legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and other contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters  and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the company 
contractual obligations and guarantees the company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements  operating leases  purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments  and other long term liabilities 
in addition  the company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period 
total payments due after under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below 
amount of obligations millions of dollars total after total debt including current maturities operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total 
table of contents the company has entered into agreements to lease production facilities for various producing oil fields 
in addition  the company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section 
the company s share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the table above 
in the normal course of its business  the company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the company fails to perform under those contracts 
the amounts of commitments as of december  that expire in future periods are shown below 
amount of commitments millions of dollars total after financial guarantees letters of credit total material off balance sheet arrangements the company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes 
the most significant of these arrangements at year end included operating leases of floating  production  storage and offloading vessels fpso for the kikeh and azurite oil fields  operating leases for production facilities at the thunder hawk and west patricia fields and for certain land and or fueling stations in the uk and uk  and natural gas transportation contracts in western canada 
the leases call for future monthly net lease payments through at kikeh and azurite  through at thunder hawk and through at west patricia 
the uk and uk fueling stations require monthly payments mostly over the next years 
the western canada transportation contracts require minimum monthly payments through future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown on the preceding page 
outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
the price for crude oil is primarily affected by the level of demand for energy 
in january  west texas intermediate crude oil traded in a band between and per barrel 
nymex natural gas traded in a band of to per mmbtu during this same time 
us retail marketing margins in january were squeezed by higher wholesale fuel costs during this period 
the company continually monitors the prices for its main products and often alters its operations and spending based on these prices 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to be higher than levels 
since the budget was approved by the company s board of directors  crude oil prices have generally been above the levels assumed in the budget  but north american natural gas prices have generally trailed the budgeted prices 
based on a recent review of capital expenditure projects  capital expenditures in are projected to total approximately billion 
of this amount  billion or about  is allocated for the exploration and production program 
geographically  e p capital is spread approximately as follows for the united states  for malaysia  for canada and for all other areas 
spending in the us is primarily associated with development and exploration programs in the eagle ford shale area of south texas 
in malaysia  the majority of the spending is for continued development of the kikeh and kakap fields in block k and oil development projects offshore sarawak in blocks sk and sk approximately of canadian spending in will relate to natural gas development activities at the tupper and tupper west areas in western canada  with most of the remainder to be spent on continued development of the seal heavy oil area and at syncrude 
refining and marketing expenditures in are budgeted at about million  or of the company total  including funds for construction of additional us retail gasoline stations 
capital and other expenditures will be routinely reviewed 
table of contents during and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during the year
