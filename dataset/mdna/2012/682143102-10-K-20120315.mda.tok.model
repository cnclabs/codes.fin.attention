item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for further information regarding forward looking statements  please refer to the special note regarding forward looking statements at the end of item of this annual report on form k 
throughout this discussion  unless the context specifies or implies otherwise  the terms company  we  us and our refer to omeros corporation and nura  inc  its wholly owned subsidiary 
overview background we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering  developing and commercializing products targeting inflammation  coagulopathies and disorders of the central nervous system 
our most clinically advanced product candidates are derived from our proprietary pharmacosurgery platform designed to improve clinical outcomes of patients undergoing arthroscopic  ophthalmological  urological and other surgical and medical procedures 
our pharmacosurgery platform is based on low dose combinations of therapeutic agents delivered directly to the surgical site throughout the duration of the procedure to preemptively inhibit inflammation and other problems caused by surgical trauma and to provide clinical benefits both during and after surgery 
we currently have four ongoing clinical development programs 
in addition  we have a deep and diverse pipeline of preclinical programs as well as a platform capable of unlocking new drug targets 
for each of our product candidates and programs  we have retained all manufacturing  marketing and distribution rights 
oms  one of our co lead pharmacosurgery product candidates  is currently being evaluated in a phase clinical program for its safety and ability to maintain intraoperative pupil dilation mydriasis in patients undergoing intraocular lens replacement surgery 
this clinical program is planned to consist of two trials that will enroll both cataract surgery and refractive lens exchange patients 
in the first phase clinical trial  oms achieved the primary endpoint of maintenance of intraoperative mydriasis 
we expect data from the second phase clinical trial during the second half of omshp  our other co lead pharmacosurgery product candidate  is being evaluated in a phase clinical program for its safety and ability to improve postoperative joint function and reduce pain following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy surgery 
this clinical program is planned to consist of separate trials conducted in north america and europe 
we expect data from the north american trial in the second half of we are in discussions with european regulatory authorities regarding the second phase clinical trial and  assuming sufficient resources  plan to begin that trial following completion of those discussions 
in the first quarter of  we announced that omshp failed to meet pre specified efficacy endpoints in a phase clinical program in patients undergoing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament  or acl  reconstruction surgery 
we were unable to draw any conclusions about omshp s effect in the phase acl program due to confounding factors  and we have no plans to conduct additional acl reconstruction trials at this time 
our third pharmacosurgery product candidate  oms  is being developed for use during urological surgery  including uroendoscopic procedures 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed a phase phase clinical trial in patients undergoing ureteroscopic removal of ureteral or renal stones 
the data showed that oms was well tolerated by the patients in this trial 

table of contents in addition to our pharmacosurgery platform  we have a pipeline of other product development programs targeting inflammation  coagulopathies and disorders of the central nervous system 
in our pparg program  we are developing proprietary compositions that include pparg agonists for the treatment and prevention of addiction to substances of abuse  which may include opioids  nicotine and alcohol 
in our pde program  we are developing proprietary compounds to treat schizophrenia and other diseases that affect cognition 
our pde program is based on our discoveries of previously unknown links between pde and any movement disorder  such as parkinson s disease  and addiction and compulsive disorders  and we are developing proprietary compounds for the treatment of these and other related disorders 
in our masp program  we are developing proprietary masp antibody therapies to treat disorders caused by complement activated inflammation  and we are advancing novel antifibrinolytic agents for the control of blood loss during surgery or resulting from trauma in our plasmin program 
in our gpcr program  we are working to complete high throughput surrogate de orphanization of orphan gpcrs  or the identification of synthetic molecules that bind and functionally interact with the receptors  and to develop product candidates that act at these new potential drug targets 
we have already announced that we have identified and confirmed sets of compounds that interact selectively with  and modulate signaling of orphan gpcrs 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement with vulcan inc and its affiliate  which we refer to collectively as vulcan  pursuant to which we received million for our gpcr program 
also during the same quarter  we entered into an agreement with the state of washington s life sciences discovery fund authority  or lsdf  under which we received a million grant award that will be paid against expenses that we incur or to reimburse us for the cost of assets that we purchase for our gpcr program 
in exchange for these payments  we agreed to pay to vulcan and lsdf a portion of net proceeds that we receive from the gpcr program 
we also issued to the vulcan affiliate three five year warrants to purchase our common stock  each for  shares  with exercise prices of  and per share  respectively 
following the receipt of the million from vulcan  we purchased from patobios intellectual property assets related to an assay technology for use in the gpcr program 
the purchase price for these assets was approximately million  of which approximately million was paid in cash and million was paid in shares of our common stock 
we have no royalty or milestone payment obligations to patobios 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and total shareholders deficit was million 
we recognized net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these losses have resulted principally from expenses incurred in connection with research and development activities  consisting primarily of clinical trials  preclinical studies and manufacturing services associated with our current product candidates 
compared to  we expect our net losses to increase as we continue to advance our clinical trials  expand our research and development efforts  add personnel for our anticipated growth and prepare for commercial launch of oms  if it is approved 
revenue through december   our revenue has consisted of grant funding from third parties and revenue recognized in connection with funding from vulcan and lsdf 
other than grant funding  we do not expect to receive any revenue from our product candidates until we receive regulatory approval and commercialize the product candidates or until we potentially enter into collaborative agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
as discussed below  we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
we continue to pursue government and private grant funding as well as collaboration funding for our product candidates and research programs 
research and development expenses the majority of our operating expenses to date have been for research and development activities 
research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our 
table of contents product development efforts  which include clinical trial and third party manufacturing services 
internal research and development costs are recognized as incurred 
third party research and development costs are expensed at the earlier of when the contracted work has been performed or when upfront and milestone payments are made 
research and development expenses include employee and consultant related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  contract research organizations  clinical trial sites  and collaborators or licensors  facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment  and third party supplier expenses including laboratory and other supplies 
our research and development expenses can be divided into clinical research and development and preclinical research and development activities 
the following table illustrates our expenses associated with these activities years ended december  in thousands direct external expenses clinical research and development oms omshp other clinical programs total clinical research and development preclinical research and development total direct external expenses internal  overhead and other expenses stock based compensation expense total research and development expenses direct external clinical research and development expenses consist primarily of external research and development and regulatory expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  contract research organizations  or cros  clinical trial sites  collaborators  licensors and consultants 
direct external preclinical research and development expenses consist primarily of our preclinical research activities  laboratory supplies and consulting 
internal  overhead and other expenses consist of personnel costs and other overhead costs such as rent  utilities and depreciation 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across multiple clinical and preclinical projects that we are advancing in parallel 
at this time  due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development processes and given the early stage of our preclinical development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for potential commercialization 
clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessments of each product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 

table of contents the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause a delay in generating product revenue and cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
because of the factors above  we are not able to estimate with any certainty when we would recognize any net cash inflows from our projects 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  legal  finance  accounting  business development  information technology and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  patent costs and professional fees for legal  consulting and audit services 
investment income investment income consists of realized gains on sales of investments and interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest on our notes payable and the amortization of both the related discount and debt issuance costs 
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt consists of losses incurred as a result of the refinancing of our loan with bluecrest venture finance master fund limited  or bluecrest 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of rental income received under subleases for use of a portion of our vivarium and laboratory facility  income received from the us qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  or qtdpp  and  in  changes in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability 
income taxes as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards expire between and unless utilized prior to such dates 
our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in the event that a change in ownership  as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  has occurred or may occur in the future 
in each period  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset  as the realization of the deferred tax asset is uncertain 
as a result  we have not recorded any federal tax benefit in our statement of operations 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  revenue 
revenue was million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue recognized in connection with the vulcan and lsdf agreements for our gpcr program  partially offset by a decrease in revenue recognized in connection with the completion of preclinical research funded by grants from the nih 

table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in this increase in was primarily due to higher clinical trial expenses associated with enrollment in our phase oms clinical trial and higher gpcr expenses in connection with our agreements with vulcan and lsdf 
these increases in were partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses associated with the completion of our omshp phase acl program and lower one time licensing fees 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with our financing activities with azimuth and lower employee expenses 
investment income 
investment income was  in compared to  in the decrease is due primarily to lower average investment balances in interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in interest expense increased in due to a higher average notes payable balance 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
the loss on extinguishment of debt was  in and relates entirely to losses incurred as a result of the refinancing of our debt with oxford finance corporation  or oxford 
other income  net 
other income was  in compared to million in the higher level of income in was primarily due to income received from the qtdpp 
comparison of years ended december  and december  revenue 
revenue was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to revenue recognized in connection with funding from vulcan and lsdf for our gpcr program and additional revenue recognized in connection with our nih grants 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in grant revenue recognized from the michael j 
fox foundation for our pde program 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher consulting costs associated with our omshp program  higher clinical trial costs associated with our phase b clinical trial evaluating oms  higher contract service costs associated with several of our development programs and an increase in employee expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with being a public company and an increase in employee expenses 
investment income 
investment income was  in compared to  in the decrease is due to lower market interest rates in compared to interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in interest expense decreased in primarily due to lower interest expense on our borrowings from bluecrest and lower amortization of the related discount and debt issuance costs 
this was partially offset by the recognition of  of the remaining unamortized bluecrest debt issuance costs and debt discount in connection with the refinancing of our bluecrest debt with oxford 
other income  net 
other income was million in compared to million in the increase in other income is primarily due to income received from the qtdpp partially offset by no warrant revaluation in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through private and public placements of equity securities for proceeds totaling million  through two debt facilities with loan proceeds totaling million  million of which was used to pay off the remaining balance of the first facility  and our gpcr program funding agreement with vulcan pursuant to which we received million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
additionally  we will receive a million cash lease incentive payment in the first quarter of related to our new office and laboratory lease with bmr elliott avenue llc 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances are held principally in interest bearing instruments  including money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with established guidelines to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
comparison of years ended december  and december  operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
expenditures related to operating activities in these periods were primarily the result of costs associated with research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
cash used to fund operating activities was lower for the year ended december   primarily due to the cash received from our vulcan funding agreement  which was recorded as deferred revenue in and is being amortized to revenue as research is performed 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
in  investing activities also included our acquisition of intellectual property assets from patobios and our subsequent reimbursement of the purchase price by vulcan 
cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect large amounts of cash used to purchase short term investments and receipts from the sale and maturity of short term investments 
these amounts primarily relate to shifts between cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
because we manage our cash usage with respect to our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  we do not consider these cash flows to be important to an understanding of our liquidity and capital resources 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our borrowing of million under tranche two of our loan from oxford in march  partially offset by principal payments on the oxford notes  which began in november net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily due to the payoff of our bluecrest loan  partially offset by proceeds received from the first tranche of our oxford loan 
comparison of years ended december  and december  operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
expenditures related to operating activities in these periods were primarily the result of costs associated with research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
cash used to fund operating activities was lower for the year ended december   primarily due to the cash received from our vulcan funding agreement  which was recorded as deferred revenue in and offset cash used to fund our operating activities 
this decrease was partially offset by higher operating expenses in and an increase in non cash stock based compensation 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
in  investing activities also included our acquisition of intellectual property assets from patobios and our subsequent reimbursement of the purchase price by vulcan 

table of contents for the year ended december   proceeds from the sales of investments consisted primarily of investments purchased with proceeds from our initial public offering 
cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect large amounts of cash used to purchase short term investments and receipts from the sale and maturity of short term investments 
these amounts primarily relate to shifts between cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
because we manage our cash usage with respect to our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  we do not consider these cash flows to be important to an understanding of our liquidity and capital resources 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in was primarily due the payoff of our bluecrest loan  partially offset by proceeds received from the first tranche of our oxford loan 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering in october for aggregate net proceeds of million 
azimuth equity line financing facility in may  we entered into an equity line financing facility with azimuth pursuant to which we may sell up to million of our shares of common stock over a month term 
this facility replaced a prior equity line financing facility  which we had entered into with azimuth on july  but had not accessed 
under the agreement with azimuth  we may  from time to time over the month term and in our sole discretion  present azimuth with draw down notices requiring azimuth to purchase a specified dollar amount of shares of our common stock  based on the volume weighted average price per share on each of consecutive trading days  or the draw down period  with the total dollar amount of each draw down subject to certain agreed upon limitations based on the market price of our common stock at the time of the draw down 
the purchase price for these shares equals the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on each date during the draw down period on which shares are purchased  less a discount ranging from to  based on a minimum price that we specify 
in addition  in our sole discretion  but subject to certain limitations  we may require azimuth to purchase a percentage of the daily trading volume of our common stock for each trading day during the draw down period 
we are allowed to present azimuth with up to draw down notices during the month term  with only one such draw down notice allowed per draw down period and a minimum of five trading days required between each draw down period 
we may not issue more than  shares in connection with the committed equity line financing facility  although this limitation does not apply if the average purchase price of all shares issued to azimuth  taking into account all discounts  equals or exceeds per share  which amount is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances specified in the facility 
we have not drawn down funds under this facility 
in connection with this facility  we entered into a new placement agent agreement with reedland capital partners  an institutional division of financial west group  member finra sipc  or fwg reedland 
we have agreed to pay fwg reedland  upon each sale of our common stock to azimuth under the facility  a fee equal to of the aggregate dollar amount of common stock purchased by azimuth upon settlement of each such sale 
pursuant to the agreement  we reimbursed  of fwg reedland s legal expenses in connection with a filing that was made by fwg reedland pursuant to finra rule stanley medical research institute funding agreement in december  we entered into a funding agreement with the stanley medical research institute  or smri  to develop a proprietary product candidate that inhibits pde for the treatment of schizophrenia 
under the agreement  we may receive grant and equity funding upon achievement of product development milestones through phase clinical trials totaling million  subject to our mutual agreement with smri 
as of december   we had received million from smri  million of which was recorded as revenue and million of which was recorded as equity funding 
as of december   all grant amounts pertaining to this agreement previously recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheet have been recognized as revenue 

table of contents oxford loan and security agreement in october  we entered into a loan and security agreement with oxford pursuant to which we borrowed million in two tranches of million each 
upon signing the agreement  we borrowed the first tranche of million  or tranche  approximately million of which we used to repay all outstanding amounts  including a prepayment fee  due under our loan and security agreement with bluecrest 
upon payment of the approximately million to bluecrest  all of our liabilities to bluecrest were paid in full  and all commitments of bluecrest to us under the loan agreement were terminated 
in march  we borrowed the second tranche of million  or tranche we are using the proceeds remaining from tranche and tranche for working capital and general business purposes 
interest on tranche and tranche accrues at annual fixed rates of and  respectively 
payments due under tranche and tranche were interest only  payable monthly  in arrears  through october  beginning november   payments of principal and interest became payable monthly  in arrears 
all unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest are due and payable on the maturity date  october  the oxford agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to  among other things  incur indebtedness  grant liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  make investments  make acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or make distributions  repurchase stock  in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type 
the oxford agreement contains no cash covenant 
the oxford agreement includes customary events of default that include  among other things  non payment defaults  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  material adverse change default  cross default to material indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency defaults  material judgment defaults  and a change of control default 
the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the oxford agreement 
under certain circumstances  a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the oxford agreement at a per annum rate equal to above the otherwise applicable interest rate 
in connection with tranche and tranche  we incurred debt issuance costs of  and  respectively  that were capitalized and included in other assets in the balance sheets 
included in the debt issuance costs of each tranche is a one time facility fee payment to oxford of  upon the last payment date of the amounts borrowed from oxford  we will be required to pay oxford a final payment fee equal to of tranche  and of tranche 
the final payment fees were recorded as a discount to the loan and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the repayment term of the initial loan amount 
we may prepay all  but not less than all  of the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under either tranche or tranche of the oxford loan agreement at any time upon prior notice to oxford and the payment of a fee equal to of the then outstanding principal amount 
as security for our obligations under the oxford agreement  we granted oxford a security interest in substantially all of our assets  excluding intellectual property 
funding requirements we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and available capital under our committed equity line financing facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses  capital expenditures and note payments for at least the next months 
our assumptions include our ability to raise capital under our million equity line financing facility with azimuth opportunity  ltd  or azimuth 
if we do not raise additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently  or enter into corporate collaborations at an earlier stage of development than we might otherwise choose 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and to the extent that we may or may not enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital 
table of contents requirements and operating expenditures required in the future 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress and results of our clinical trials for our pharmacosurgery programs  costs related to manufacturing services  whether the hiring of a number of new employees to support our continued growth during this period will occur at salary levels consistent with our estimates  the scope  rate of progress  results and costs of our preclinical testing  clinical trials and other research and development activities for additional product candidates  the terms and timing of payments of any collaborative or licensing agreements that we have or may establish  the cost  timing and outcomes of the regulatory processes for our product candidates  market acceptance of our approved products  should they gain approval  the costs of commercialization activities  including product manufacturing  marketing  sales and distribution  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to these types of transactions  whether we receive grant funding for our programs  our degree of success in commercializing oms  omshp and other product candidates  the extent to which we draw down funds under our committed equity line financing facility with azimuth or otherwise access the capital markets  and the amount of revenue we generate from the sale of our product candidates  which revenue we do not expect until at least we expect our continuing operating losses to result in an increasing total amount of cash used in operations over the next several years 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
except for our committed equity line financing facility with azimuth  we currently do not have any commitments for future external equity or debt funding 
additional equity or debt financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  any future equity funding will dilute the ownership of our equity investors 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due within year years years more than years total in thousands operating leases capital leases principal and interest license maintenance fees notes payable principal and interest total 
table of contents on january   we entered into a lease with bmr elliott avenue llc for approximately  square feet of office and laboratory space 
the term of the lease is years with two options to extend the lease term  each by five years 
the expected lease term commencement date is october  the annual base rent due under the lease is for the first year  million for the second year  million for the third year and will increase by each year thereafter 
these amounts are not included in the table above 
we will also be responsible for paying our proportionate share of utilities  taxes  insurance and maintenance as well as a property management fee 
additionally  we will receive a million cash lease incentive that will be amortized over the initial lease term at the annual rate of we may also be required to make royalty and milestone payments under the following agreements with third parties that are not listed in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine when or if the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur pursuant to our patent assignment agreement with roberto ciccocioppo  phd under which we acquired assets for our pparg program  we may be required to pay a low single digit percentage royalty on any net sales of a product from our pparg program that is covered by any patents that issue from the patent application we acquired from dr 
ciccocioppo 
in addition  if we grant any third parties rights to manufacture  sell or distribute any such products  we must pay to dr 
ciccocioppo a percentage of any associated fees we receive from such third parties in the range of low single digits to low double digits depending on stage of development at which such rights are granted 
we also may be required to make total milestone payments of up to million upon the achievement of certain development events  such as the initiation of clinical trials and receipt of marketing approval 
pursuant to our agreement with smri  beginning the first calendar year after commencement of commercial sales of a product candidate from our pde program  we will be obligated to pay royalties to smri based on net income  as defined in the agreement  not to exceed a set multiple of total grant funding received 
based on the amount of grant funding that we have received as of december   the maximum amount of royalties payable to smri is million 
under our pde inhibitor license agreement with daiichi sankyo  we have agreed to make milestone payments to daiichi sankyo of up to an aggregate total of million upon the achievement of certain events  such as successful completion of preclinical toxicology studies  dosing of human subjects in phase  and clinical trials  receipt of marketing approval of a pde inhibitor product  and reaching specified sales milestones 
in addition  daiichi sankyo is entitled to receive from us a low single digit percentage royalty of any net sales of a pde inhibitor licensed under the agreement by us and or our sublicensee s  provided that if the sales are made by a sublicensee  then the amount payable by us to daiichi sankyo is capped at an amount equal to a low double digit percentage of all royalty and specified milestone payments received by us from the sublicensee 
pursuant to our exclusive license agreement with helion  we agreed to make development and sales milestone payments to helion of up to million upon the achievement of certain events related to our masp program  such as the filing of an ind application with the fda  initiation of phase and clinical trials  receipt of marketing approval  and reaching specified sales milestones 
in addition  helion is entitled to receive from us a low single digit percentage royalty of any net sales of a masp inhibitor product that is covered by the patents licensed by us under the agreement 
pursuant to our agreements with vulcan and lsdf  we agreed to pay vulcan and lsdf tiered percentages of the net proceeds  if any  derived from our gpcr program 
the percentage rates of net proceeds payable to vulcan and lsdf decrease as the cumulative net proceeds reach specified thresholds  and the blended percentage rate payable to vulcan and lsdf in the aggregate is in the mid teens with respect to the first approximately billion of cumulative net proceeds that we receive from our gpcr program 
after we have received approximately billion of cumulative net proceeds  the percentage rate payable to vulcan and lsdf in the aggregate decreases to one percent 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results could differ from those estimates 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical judgment by management and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  research and development expenses  primarily clinical trial expenses  and stock based compensation 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from grant funding from third parties and revenue recognized in connection with funding from vulcan and lsdf for our gpcr program 
we recognize revenue when the related qualified research and development expenses are incurred or services are provided up to the limit of the approved funding amounts 
the accounting standards for revenue provide a framework for accounting for revenue arrangements 
a variety of factors are considered in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the various elements can be considered separate units of accounting  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements and whether there is a separate earnings process associated with a particular element of an agreement 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised primarily of employee and consultant related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third party manufacturing organizations  cros and clinical trial sites  facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment  third party supplier expenses  including laboratory and 
table of contents other supplies  and payments to collaborators and licensors 
clinical trial expenses for investigational sites require certain estimates 
we estimate these costs based on a cost per patient that varies depending on the clinical trial site 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our estimates  these changes in estimates may result in understated or overstated expenses at a given point in time 
internal and third party research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized on the straight line method as expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at fair value as of the grant date 
the fair value of our stock options is calculated using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes model requires the input of various subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense for new awards may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
as stock based compensation expense is based on options ultimately expected to vest  the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience  separate groups of employees that have similar historical forfeiture behavior are considered separately for expense recognition 
stock options granted to non employees are accounted for using the fair value approach
