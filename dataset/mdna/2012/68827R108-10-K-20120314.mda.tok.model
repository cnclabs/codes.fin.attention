in particular  we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described under risk factors included as item a in this annual report on form k 
these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied by past results and trends 
forward looking statements are statements that attempt to project or anticipate future developments in our business  we encourage you to review the examples of forward looking statements included in this annual report on form k under item at the beginning of this report 
these statements  like all statements in this report  speak only as of the date of this report unless another date is indicated  and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements in light of future developments 
the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for each of the three years in the period ended december  and significant factors that could affect our prospective financial condition and results of operations 
you should read this discussion together with our financial statements and notes included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
business overview we are a leading stem cell company headquartered in columbia  maryland and focused on developing and marketing products to treat medical conditions in the inflammatory  cardiovascular  orthopedic and wound healing markets 
we currently market and distribute grafix and ovation for tissue repair 
our pipeline of internally developed biologic drug candidates under evaluation includes prochymal for inflammatory  autoimmune and cardiovascular indications  as well as chondrogen for arthritis in the knee 
we believe our stem cell products have significant therapeutic potential because of their ability to regulate inflammation  promote tissue regeneration and prevent pathological scar formation 
we began operations on december  and were a delaware corporation until  with approval of our stockholders  we reincorporated as a maryland corporation on may  we have two business segments  therapeutics and biosurgery 
our therapeutics business is focused on developing biologic stem cell drug candidates from a readily available and non controversial source adult bone marrow 
our biosurgery division works to harness the ability of cells and novel constructs to promote the body s natural healing with the goals of improving surgical outcomes and offering better treatment options for patients and physicians 

table of contents we believe cellular therapies have certain advantages over traditional medical approaches 
for example  cell therapies can be targeted  avoiding many of the safety complications arising from systemic treatments 
cell therapies can also be responsive to their environment  turning on or off certain effects as conditions in the surrounding tissue change 
cell therapies can also be multifaceted 
for example  the cells in prochymal  our leading biologic drug candidate  have demonstrated the ability to not only downregulate inflammation  but also to promote repair of the damage caused by the inflammation 
we believe the combination of these unique properties will allow us to solve many of the more challenging questions facing medicine today 
we have established ourselves as the leader in the emerging field of cell therapy 
we are an industry leader in the field  having developed the first commercially available stem cell product 
we are a fully integrated company  having developed capabilities in research  development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of stem cell products 
we have developed an extensive intellectual property portfolio to protect our technology in the united states and a number of foreign countries  including us and foreign patents owned or licensed 
we believe that our biologic drug candidates have advantages over other stem cell therapeutics in development for at least the following reasons stem cell source 
our stem cells are obtained from adult bone marrow  a readily available source 
the cells are drawn from the hips of volunteer donors between the ages of and years  using a simple needle and syringe aspiration 
because the cells are obtained from consenting adult donors  we are able to largely avoid the ethical controversy surrounding embryonic and fetal stem cell research 
ability to mass produce 
through our proprietary manufacturing methods  we can grow mesenchymal stem cells msc in a controlled fashion to produce up to  treatments of our biologic drug candidates from a single bone marrow donation 
our ability to produce a large quantity of treatments from one donation provides us with manufacturing efficiencies and product consistency that are essential to commercialization 
universal compatibility 
many stem cell therapies under development can elicit a rejection response in the recipient and therefore require donor to recipient matching or potentially harmful immunosuppression 
this greatly reduces manufacturing efficiencies and creates a risk of mismatch which can result in an acute inflammatory response and  potentially  in death 
based on our clinical experience  we believe that our biologic drug candidates are not rejected by the patient s immune system and so  like type o negative blood  do not require donor to recipient matching 
this universal compatibility allows us to produce a standardized product available to all patients in almost any medical setting 
treatment on demand 
our biologic drug candidates can be stored frozen at end user medical facilities until they are needed 
we anticipate that medical facilities will be able to prescribe and dispense these products in much the same way as conventional drugs 
in contrast  other stem cell technologies under development require weeks to prepare after a patient s need is identified 
this is a key feature of our technology  as many patients in the critical care setting require prompt treatment 
in april  we committed to a plan to sell our assets related to osteocel  a product that we had produced and marketed since july  for regenerating bone in orthopedic indications 
on may   we entered into an agreement to sell our entire osteocel and osteocel xo product line to nuvasive  inc the first of two scheduled closings in connection with this transaction  the technology assets closing  occurred on july   at which time we received an initial payment of million 
the second and final closing  the manufacturing assets closing  occurred on april  as of december   we had received the full million proceeds from the sale of our 
table of contents osteocel business 
as a result  all of the activities related to our osteocel product line have been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
in the third fiscal quarter of  we created our biosurgery segment focused on developing  manufacturing and distributing high end biologic products for use in surgical procedures 
we commenced the manufacturing of our first biologic product of the biosurgery segment in the first quarter of and launched the product for limited commercial distribution and evaluation during third quarter of fiscal we recognized sales of  during and million during fiscal financial operations overview revenue in  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genzyme  then an independent and now a sanofi company genzyme  for the development and commercialization of prochymal and chondrogen 
under the collaboration agreement we received non contingent  non refundable up front payments of million  and are entitled to receive contingent milestone payments and royalties in the event of sales by genzyme thereunder 
this collaboration agreement has multiple deliverables  and consistent with our accounting policy for such transactions  we amortize these amounts into revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated completion period of the deliverables  which extend through the first quarter of we recognized million of revenue in each of fiscal  and related to this agreement 
in february  sanofi issued a press release which included an update on their r d pipeline  stating that it has discontinued its project with prochymal for gvhd 
the statement issued by sanofi was made without consultation with or knowledge by us 
through our legal counsel  we have advised sanofi that we are treating these public statements as sanofi s election to terminate the collaboration agreement 
the agreement provides for voluntary termination by sanofi and that  upon such voluntary termination  all rights to prochymal revert back to us  and we are free to commercialize or enter into commercialization agreements for prochymal with other parties without restriction 
while we have been proceeding on the basis that sanofi has terminated the collaboration agreement  sanofi has since advised us that it disagrees with our characterization of their press release 
we have requested an explanation from sanofi with respect to their statements regarding prochymal 
there can be no assurances as to the outcome of these matters 
however  we continue to proceed with our prochymal regulatory approval efforts and  if successful  commercialization  alone or with another collaborator 
in  we also partnered with genzyme to develop prochymal as a medical countermeasure to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies 
in the first quarter of  we were awarded a contract from the united states department of defense dod pursuant to which we  in partnership with genzyme  are seeking to develop and stockpile prochymal for the repair of gastrointestinal injury resulting from acute radiation exposure 
under the terms of the contract  the dod will provide funding to us  and if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for acute radiation syndrome  the contract provides for the purchase of up to  doses of prochymal  at  per dose 
under the terms of this contract  we recognized  in revenue in fiscal  and million in revenue in fiscal in prior years  we have entered into strategic agreements with other companies for the development and commercialization of select stem cell biologic drug candidates for specific indications and geographic markets 
in  we entered into a collaborative agreement with the juvenile diabetes research foundation to conduct a phase clinical trial evaluating prochymal as a treatment for type diabetes mellitus 
this collaborative agreement provides for jdrf to provide million of contingent milestone funding to support the development of prochymal for the preservation of insulin production in patients with newly diagnosed type diabetes mellitus 
the contingent milestone payments under the agreement are amortized into revenue on a straight line basis over the duration of our obligations 
table of contents under the collaborative agreement as they are earned 
as of december   we had achieved all million of the milestones available under the contract and recognized the entire funding as revenue 
in fiscal  we recognized  in revenue  in fiscal  we received the final  milestone and recognized million in revenue 
we received million in milestone payments from jdrf in fiscal and recognized million in revenue 
in  we entered into an agreement with jcr pharmaceuticals  granting it exclusive rights to prochymal for the treatment of gvhd and other hematological malignancies in japan 
during the first quarter of  we achieved a million milestone from jcr for development progress in japan 
the collaboration with jcr also provides for additional milestone payments of up to million for regulatory and sales milestones  as well as royalty payments on sales of the drug in japan 
research and development costs our research and development costs consist of expenses incurred in identifying  developing and testing biologic drug candidates and biologic tissue based products 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  costs of contract research and manufacturing  costs of facilities  and the costs of manufacturing clinical batches of biologic drug candidates  quality control supplies and material to expand biologic drug candidates 
consistent with our focus on the development of biologic drug candidates with potential uses in multiple indications  many of our costs are not attributable to a specifically identified product 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects 
accordingly  we do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
from inception in december through december   we incurred aggregate research and development costs of approximately million 
prior to  internal resources were applied interchangeably across several product candidates due to the potential applicability of our biologic drug candidates for multiple indications 
therefore  it was not possible to allocate internal r d costs on either a project by project or product by product basis in beginning in  with the creation of our biosurgery segment  we began to separately track research and development costs by segment 
during fiscal  we incurred million of research and development costs in our therapeutics segment and million in our biosurgery segment 
for  our total research and development costs were million for our therapeutics segment and million for our biosurgery segment 
as described above  we do not track internal development costs by project within the therapeutics segment 
we do  however  track external research and development costs on a project basis 
during fiscal  we incurred million in external research and development costs  including third party contract costs  supply and lab costs  and other miscellaneous external costs on our acute myocardial infarction clinical trial  million on our refractory crohn s disease clinical trial   on treatment resistant gvhd and  on smaller projects 
for  our external research and development costs  were approximately million for prochymal to treat first line and steroid refractory acute gvhd   for prochymal to treat crohn s disease  million for prochymal to repair heart tissue following a heart attack  million for prochymal for the protection of pancreatic islet cells in patients with type diabetes   for prochymal to treat copd  and approximately  for smaller projects 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to be substantial in the future  as we continue our clinical trial activity for our existing biologic drug candidates as they advance through the development cycle  and as we invest in additional product opportunities and research programs 
clinical trials and preclinical studies are time consuming and expensive 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to many uncertainties 
we test our products in several preclinical studies  and we then conduct clinical trials for those biologic drug 
table of contents candidates that we determine to be the most promising 
as we obtain results from clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay trials for some biologic drug candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising biologic drug candidates 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  size of trial and intended use of a biologic drug candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  the number of sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the duration of patient treatment and follow up  the costs of producing supplies of the biologic drug candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the efficacy and safety profile of the biologic drug candidate  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
as a result of these uncertainties  we are unable to determine with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our biologic drug candidates 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with our general management  including salaries  allocations of facilities and related costs  and professional fees such as legal and accounting expenses 
we have increased our general and administrative expense for legal and accounting compliance costs  investor relations and other activities associated with operating as a publicly traded company and strengthened our administrative capabilities as we approach the commercial launch of prochymal for an initial indication 
continued increases will also likely result from the hiring of additional operational  financial  accounting  facilities engineering and information systems personnel 
other income expense  net other income expense consists of interest earned on our cash and investments available for sale and realized gains and losses incurred on the sale of these investments 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on capital leases and other debt financings 
we do not expect to incur material interest expense in the future as we had extinguished all of our outstanding debt prior to fiscal income taxes until fiscal  we have not recognized any net deferred tax assets or liabilities in our financial statements since we cannot assure their future realization 
because realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  a full valuation allowance has been recorded on the net deferred tax assets  which relate primarily to net operating loss and research and development carry forwards 
in the event that we become profitable within the next several years  we have net deferred tax assets before a valuation allowance of approximately million that may be utilized prior to us having to recognize any income tax expense or make payments to the taxing authorities other than the alternative minimum tax 
the income from the upfront fees we received from genzyme corporation is required to be recognized over several years from through for financial statement reporting purposes 
for income tax purposes  the income was required to be fully recognized in and this resulted in our releasing million of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in fiscal 
table of contents we recognized million of the resulting deferred tax asset in  and expect to recognize the remaining million deferred tax asset in in fiscal  we recorded a provision for income taxes to recognize the us federal alternative minimum tax on our taxable income 
in fiscal  we recorded a provision for income taxes of  to recognize a true up of the payables account that was identified when we filed our federal income tax return 
the effective tax rate of  as compared to a us statutory rate of  reflects this adjustment 
we do not expect to be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax in fiscal the tax provision for reflects an effective tax rate for continuing operations of compared to a us statutory tax rate of 
the effective tax rate reflects our estimated annual effective tax rate  which reflects our expectation that a portion of our income will be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax in  which is almost entirely offset by a release of valuation allowance discussed above 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  deferred tax assets  share based compensation  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from collaborative agreements  research licenses  and a government contract 
we evaluate revenues from agreements that have multiple elements to determine whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
to recognize a delivered item in a multiple element arrangement  the delivered items must have value on a stand alone basis  there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items  and the delivery or performance must be probable and within our control for any delivered items that have a right of return 
the determination of whether multiple elements of a collaboration agreement meet the criteria for separate units of accounting requires us to exercise judgment 
revenues from research licenses and government contracts are recognized as earned upon either the incurring of reimbursable expenses directly related to the particular research plan or the completion of certain development milestones as defined within the terms of the agreement 
payments received in advance of research performed are designated as deferred revenue 
non refundable upfront license fees and certain other related fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the development periods of the contract deliverables 
fees associated with substantive at risk performance based milestones are recognized as revenue upon their completion  as defined in the respective agreements 
incidental assignment of technology rights is recognized as revenue as it is earned and received 
in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genzyme for the development and commercialization of prochymal and chondrogen 
under this agreement  genzyme paid to us non contingent  non refundable cash payments totaling million 
the agreement provided 
table of contents genzyme with certain rights to intellectual property developed by us  and required that we continue to perform certain development work related to the subject biologic drug candidates 
we have evaluated the deliverables related to these payments  and concluded that the various deliverables represent a single unit of accounting 
for this reason  we have deferred the recognition of revenue related to the upfront payments  and are amortizing these amounts to revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated delivery period of the required development services  which extend through january accordingly  we recognized million of revenue in each of the years ended december   and related to the amortization of the upfront payments 
the balance of these payments has been recorded as million of current deferred revenue as of december  in february  sanofi issued a press release which included an update on their r d pipeline  stating that it has discontinued its project with prochymal for gvhd 
the statement issued by sanofi was made without consultation with or knowledge by us 
through our legal counsel  we have advised sanofi that we are treating these public statements as sanofi s election to terminate the collaboration agreement 
the agreement provides for voluntary termination by sanofi and that  upon such voluntary termination  all rights to prochymal revert back to us  and we are free to commercialize or enter into commercialization agreements for prochymal with other parties without restriction 
while we have been proceeding on the basis that sanofi has terminated the collaboration agreement  sanofi has since advised us that it disagrees with our characterization of their press release 
we have requested an explanation from sanofi with respect to their statements regarding prochymal 
there can be no assurances as to the outcome of these matters 
however  we continue to proceed with our prochymal regulatory approval efforts and  if successful  commercialization  alone or with another collaborator 
in  we also partnered with genzyme to develop prochymal as a medical countermeasure to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies 
in january  we were awarded a contract from the united states department of defense dod pursuant to which we  in partnership with genzyme  are seeking to develop and stockpile prochymal for the repair of gastrointestinal injury resulting from acute radiation exposure 
we began recognizing revenue under this contract during the first quarter of contract revenue is recognized as the related costs are incurred  in accordance with the terms of the contract 
we recognized approximately  and million in revenue from the dod contract during  and  respectively 
we did not work on nuclear countermeasures during fiscal and are not pursuing any additional government contracts for this indication 
our agreement with genzyme for nuclear countermeasures expired  in accordance with the terms of the contract in fiscal in october  we entered into a collaborative agreement with the juvenile diabetes research foundation jdrf to conduct a phase clinical trial evaluating prochymal as a treatment for type diabetes mellitus 
this collaborative agreement provides for jdrf to provide up to million of contingent milestone funding to support the development of prochymal for the preservation of insulin production in patients with newly diagnosed type diabetes mellitus 
the contingent milestone payments under the agreement are amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the duration of our obligations under the collaborative agreement as they are earned 
as of december   we had achieved all million of the contingent milestones under the contract  and we have recognized all million as revenue 
we began amortizing the each payment as it was received  resulting in  of revenue during fiscal and million of revenue during both and under the agreement with jdrf 
we have also entered into strategic agreements with other pharmaceutical companies focusing on the development and commercialization of our stem cell drug products 
for example  in  we entered into an agreement with jcr pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
jcr pertaining to hematologic malignancies gvhd drugs for distribution in japan 
under such agreements  we receive fees for licensing the use of our technology 
we recognized million of revenue during the first fiscal quarter of from jcr upon the achievement of a milestone event specified in the agreement 

table of contents we also earn royalties on the sale of human mesenchymal stem cells sold for research purposes and recognize the revenue on these sales as the sales are made 
revenues include approximately  of royalty revenue during fiscal and  during each of the years and in the third quarter of  we created a new biosurgery segment  focused on developing high end biologic products for use in surgical procedures 
we commenced manufacturing our first biosurgery product during the first quarter of and began distributing the product only for initial clinical evaluation 
we launched the product for limited commercial distribution in the third quarter of and have recognized revenues of  during fiscal during fiscal  we recognized million of biosurgery revenue 
legal title passes to the customers when the product leaves our shipping dock and we recognize revenue upon shipping the product 
due to the nature of the products and the manufacturing process  we do not allow refunds or returns 
investments available for sale and other comprehensive income investments available for sale consist primarily of marketable securities with maturities less than one year 
investments available for sale are valued at their fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
all realized gains and losses on our investments available for sale are recognized in results of operations as investment income  a component of other income expense  net 
investments available for sale are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management reviews criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  as well as the reasons for the decline  to predict whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
if a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reported at their net realizable value 
we charge off uncollectible receivables when the likelihood of collection is remote 
we consider receivables outstanding more than days to be past due 
as of december  and  there was no allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable  as we believe the reported amounts are fully collectible 
accounts receivable balances are not collateralized 
we have incurred bad debt expense of  related to our biosurgery operations during fiscal and no bad debts expense during the two years ended december  inventory we commenced limited distribution of our biosurgery products during the third quarter of  and began carrying inventory on our balance sheet thereafter 
inventory consists of raw materials  biologic products in process  and products available for distribution 
we determine our inventory values using the first in  first out method 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  and excludes units that we anticipate distributing for clinical evaluation 
we do not carry any inventory for our therapeutics products  as none of the products from this segment are currently available for commercial sale 
its operations have focused on clinical trials and discovery efforts to identify additional medical indications 
accordingly  manufactured clinical doses of our drug candidates are expensed as incurred  consistent with our accounting for all other research and development costs 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated future cash flows 
if an impairment indicator is present  we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of assets 
fair value is generally determined by estimates of discounted cash flows 
the discount rate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows would be the rate required for a similar investment of like risk 
there were no impairment losses recognized during the fiscal years  or research and development costs we expense internal and external research and development r d costs  including costs of funded r d arrangements and the manufacture of clinical batches of our biologic drug candidates used in clinical trials  in the period incurred 
prior to  internal resources were applied interchangeably across several product candidates due to the potential applicability of our biologic drug candidates for multiple indications 
therefore  it is not possible to allocate internal r d costs on either a project by project or product by product basis in beginning in  with the creation of our biosurgery segment  we began to separately track research and development costs by segment 
during fiscal  our total research and development expenses were million for our therapeutics segment and million for our biosurgery segment 
for  our total research and development costs were million for our therapeutics segment and million for our biosurgery segment 
as described above  we do not track internal development costs by project within the therapeutics segment 
we do  however  track external research and development costs on a project basis 
during fiscal  our external research and development expenses  including third party contract costs  supply and lab costs and other miscellaneous external costs were approximately million for acute myocardial infarction  million for steroid refractory crohn s disease   for treatment resistant gvhd and  for other therapeutic programs 
for  our external research and development costs  including third party contract costs  supply and lab costs  and other miscellaneous external costs  were approximately million for prochymal to repair heart tissue following a heart attack  million for treatment resistant gvhd  million for prochymal for the protection of pancreatic islet cells in patients with type diabetes   for prochymal to treat copd  and approximately  for other therapeutic programs 
income taxes deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences  income tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards 
temporary differences are primarily the result of the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting values 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured by applying the enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or realized 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense  if any  consists of the taxes payable for the current period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 

table of contents we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recorded as income tax expense 
at december  and  we had no accruals for interest or penalties related to income tax matters 
share based compensation we account for share based payments using the fair value method 
we recognize all share based payments to employees and non employee directors in our financial statements based on their grant date fair values  calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
compensation expense related to share based awards is recognized on a straight line basis based on the value of share awards that are expected to vest during the requisite service period on the grant date  which is revised for forfeitures 
recent accounting guidance not yet adopted at december  in may  asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu was issued to standardize requirements for measuring and disclosing fair value information under us gaap and ifrs 
this guidance primarily changes the wording used to describe disclosure requirements under us gaap  but is not intended to change the application of those requirements 
asu is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after december  with early adoption not permitted 
since asu changes the wording used to describe the fair value disclosure requirements  but does not materially change the actual requirements  the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu was issued to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
specifically  this guidance requires entities to report all non owner changes in stockholders equity in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate  but consecutive  statements this guidance eliminates the current financial reporting option for an entity to report the components of other comprehensive income as a part of the statement in changes in stockholders equity 
further  this guidance requires presentation of all reclassification adjustments between net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements 
asu is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we will be required to change the format of our financial statements when this guidance becomes effective  and are currently evaluating which of the two permissible formats to use 
the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  asu  health care entities topic presentation and disclosure of patient service revenue  provision for bad debts  and allowance for doubtful accounts for certain health care entities asu was issued to increase the transparency of net patient service revenue and the related allowance for doubtful accounts for health care entities 
specifically  this guidance requires entities to report the provision for bad debts associated with patient service revenue as a deduction from patient service revenues as opposed to as an operating expense 
this guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the accounting policies for revenues and assessing bad debts 
asu is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to december  revenues from collaborative research agreements  government contract and royalties revenues from collaborative research agreements and royalties were million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal during fiscal  we recognized million in revenue from the collaborative agreement with genzyme   from our collaboration with jdrf   from our compassionate use protocol for treatment resistant gvhd in adults and  in royalties 
our revenues for fiscal also included million from the genzyme agreements  million from the jdrf collaboration  million milestone payment from the license agreement with jcr pharmaceuticals and  for the government contract with the united states department of defense 
biosurgery product revenues gross profit we began developing an internal distribution network during fiscal and are increasing our network of distributors for our biosurgery products 
during fiscal  we recognized revenues of million compared to  during fiscal we are continuing to distribute some biosurgery products for clinical evaluation and expect to commence a reimbursement clinical trial during fiscal our gross profit on biosurgery products was  during fiscal  which represents approximately of revenues 
our gross profit in was approximately of revenues 
we expect our gross profit to vary while we continue to increase distribution and more fully utilize our production facilities in a consistently efficient manner 
research and development expenses research and development expenses during fiscal were million compared to million during fiscal research and development expenses for include million incurred in our therapeutics segment and million in our biosurgery segment  compared to million of therapeutics research and development costs and of biosurgery r d during fiscal the decline in therapeutics r d expenses during fiscal of approximately million is principally related to the completion of the majority of patient treatment costs in our phase cardiac trial 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses during fiscal were million compared to million during fiscal the change between fiscal years is not material 
other income  net other income  net consists of our net realized investment income earned on our investments available for sale 
other income  net was  during fiscal and  during fiscal the decrease between years reflects the reductions in our investments available for sale to fund our operations combined with the very low yields offered on investment grade securities during fiscal income taxes income taxes of  was recognized in fiscal and resulted from the true up of our tax asset accounts in connection with the filing of our income tax returns 
income taxes of  was recognized during fiscal and consists of federal income tax of million  state income tax of million  net of the release of valuation allowance release of million and the true of our 
table of contents income tax payable account to the income tax returns 
we do not expect to be liable for the alternative minimum tax for fiscal fees paid to related parties  including share based payments share based payments to members of our board of directors were million during fiscal compared to  during fiscal the fiscal charge includes a one time non cash charge of approximately million related to the extension of the expiration date of a warrant held by the chairman of our board of directors 
this transaction was approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting 
non employee members of our board of directors are compensated by an annual award of stock that is paid in either unrestricted shares of our common stock or cash  or a combination of stock and cash 
during fiscal  we issued  shares of common stock and paid  cash to our non employee directors 
during fiscal  we issued  shares of common stock and paid  cash to our non employee directors 
year ended december  compared to december  revenues from collaborative research agreements  government contract and royalties revenues from collaborative research agreements  government contract and royalties were million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal during  we recognized million in revenue from our collaborative agreement with genzyme  million from our collaboration with jcr  and million from our collaborative agreement with jdrf 
our revenues for also include  from our contract with the dod to develop prochymal for the treatment of acute radiation syndrome  plus royalties on mscs sold for research purposes 
revenues for were comprised primarily of million in revenue from the genzyme collaboration agreement  million from our contract with dod and million from the jdrf agreement 
biosurgery product revenues during  we launched limited commercial distribution of wound care products manufactured by our biosurgery segment and recognized  in revenue and gross profit of  during  we distributed the majority of these products for clinical evaluation and expect commercial distribution to increase slowly until we obtain reimbursement approvals 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal were million as compared to research and development expenses of million for research and development expenses for include million of development and initial manufacturing costs associated with our biosurgery segment 
the reduction in research and development expenses during when compared to the prior year reflects the completion of enrollment in several of our phase clinical trials and the associated reduction in site and patient costs

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december   we had million in cash and million in investments available for sale 
in addition  we have not had any outstanding debt at any time since fiscal during the fiscal year ended december   we generated cash from operating activities for the first time since our inception  as a result of the million portion of the up front fees received under the collaboration agreement with genzyme 
we generated a further million of cash in up front fees during fiscal we used a portion of these proceeds to completely extinguish our debt during  and have since consistently made purchases of investments available for sale with our excess cash 
we have used these receipts to fund our operations since fiscal although there can be no assurances  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity on hand as of december  to fund our operations through the anticipated date of commercialization of our first biological drug candidate 
cash flow the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for each of our three most recently completed fiscal years years ended december  amounts in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash used in operating activities during fiscal was million  and primarily reflects the amortization of deferred revenue related to the genzyme collaboration agreement  partially offset by our net income of million and non cash expenses of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december   primarily reflecting the amortization of the deferred revenue received from genzyme  partially offset by our net income 
we had a net use of cash by our operating activities during fiscal of million  primarily as the result of our receiving an aggregate of million from the sale of our osteocel asset group through the delivery of shares of nuvasive common stock  as provided for under the asset purchase agreement 
comprising this amount  payments of million were made to us on june  and september   and a payment of million was made to us in october  all through the delivery of shares of nuvasive common stock having equivalent value 
the cash proceeds from these shares are reported as cash generated by our financing activities 
had these payments been received in cash instead of shares of stock to be subsequently sold  the cash flow would have been reported as cash provided by operating activities  resulting in net cash provided by operating activities during during fiscal  our continuing operations used million of cash  primarily reflecting our loss from continuing operations and cash used to fund operating assets  which was partially offset by the million installment of up front payments received from genzyme on july  net cash used by discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   which was the result of million of the payments for the sale of our osteocel line of business being received in shares of stock as discussed above 
net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal was million and primarily reflects proceeds from the sales of our investments to fund our operations 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   virtually all of which was 
table of contents the result of our sale of investments available for sale to fund operations 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   all of which was attributable to our continuing operations 
during that period  we generated million of cash from the sale of our osteocel asset group and had million of proceeds from the sale of investments available for sale  primarily representing the sale of the nuvasive shares of common stock we received as partial payment for the osteocel line of business  as described above 
these cash inflows were partially offset by million of purchases of investments available for sale with our excess cash on hand during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities was insignificant in each of the three years ended december  capital resources 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope and results of our research and preclinical development programs  the scope and results of our clinical trials  particularly regarding the number of patients required for our phase trials  the timing of and the costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our biologic drug candidates  which could be more lengthy or complex than obtaining approval for a new conventional drug  given the fda s limited experience with late stage clinical trials and marketing approval for stem cell therapeutics  the resolution or not of the uncertainty regarding the status of the genzyme collaboration agreement  and the cost involved in pursuing such resolution  the costs of maintaining  expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio  including possible litigation costs and liabilities  and the costs of enlarging our work force consistent with expanding our business and operations and distribution of our biosurgery products and if approved for sale  our biological drug product 
we did not have any outstanding debt at any time during as a result of our financial position and forecasts as of december   we believe that we have sufficient liquidity on hand as of that date to fund our operations through the expected date of initial commercialization of our biological drug candidate 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and we have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
future contractual obligations the following table sets forth our estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations at december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based on the terms of the relevant agreements  
table of contents appropriate classification of item under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and certain assumptions 
future events could cause actual payments to differ from these amounts 
payment due by fiscal year contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years amounts in thousands operating lease facilities contract research organizations total contractual cash obligations contract research organizations 
we contract with independent contract research organizations  or cros  to perform many of the tasks required under our clinical trials of our biological drug candidates  and we utilize their testing expertise to ensure the objectivity of the clinical results 
under the terms of these agreements  we design the protocol regarding the testing to be performed  and the cro assists in the enrollment of the patients and testing sites  administers the trial  performs statistical analysis of the results  and compiles the final report 
we pay fees directly to the cros for their professional services  which may be payable upon specified trial milestones or as they provide services  depending on the structure of the contract 
we are also responsible for reimbursing the cros for certain pass thru expenses they incur in administering the trial 
the timing of our payments to the cros is dependent upon the progress of the various trials  which is highly variable dependent upon the speed with which the cros are able to enroll patients and testing sites 
as such  we are unable to specifically predict the timing of future payments to cros 
as of december   we had active contracts with cros related to three on going clinical trials which were in varying stages of completion 
the total contracted payments to cros under these agreements were million  of which we had incurred approximately million as of that date 
although we cannot directly control the timing of the remaining payments  based on our estimates and assumptions as of december   we expect to pay our remaining obligations of million to these cros during subsequent to december   we contracted with a cro to perform a clinical trial for our biosurgery segment 
this contract provides for total costs of approximately million over a period of approximately years 
since the cro has not yet begun work under this contract  we are presently unable to accurately predict the timing of these payments 
leases 
during  we entered into a sublease agreement for approximately  square feet of laboratory  production  warehouse and office space in columbia  maryland 
we have also entered into a direct lease with the owner of this facility that was effective as of june  upon the expiration of the sublease and expires in july during  following the expiration of the sublease agreement  we increased an outstanding letter of credit  which was used in lieu of a security deposit for this lease  to  according to the terms of the direct lease with the owner of the facility 
at each of july  and  the security deposit required under this lease decreased to  and  respectively 
we reduced our outstanding letter of credit accordingly  and the reduced letter of credit of  remained outstanding as of december   and has been fully collateralized by restricted cash 

table of contents effect of inflation 
inflation and changing prices are not generally a material factor affecting our business 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and lease costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk due to the short duration of our investment portfolio and the high quality of our investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any material degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
we believe that the interest rate risk related to our accounts receivable is not significant 
we manage the risk associated with these accounts through periodic reviews of the carrying value for non collectability and establishment of appropriate allowances in connection with our internal controls and policies 
foreign current exchange rate risk we conduct clinical trial activities in areas that operate in a functional currency other than the united states dollar usd 
as a result  when the usd rises and falls against the functional currencies of these other nations  our costs will either increase or decrease by the relative change in the exchange rate 
foreign currency gains and losses were not material during the three years ended december   and at the present time  we have elected not to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
derivative instruments we do not enter into hedging or derivative instrument arrangements
