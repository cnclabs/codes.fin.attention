startek advantage is focused on improving customer experience and reducing total cost of ownership for our clients

we manage programs using a variety of multi channel customer interaction capabilities including voice  chat  email  ivr and back office support 
startek has delivery centers in the us  philippines  canada  costa rica  honduras and through its startek home workforce 
we seek to become a market leader in providing meaningful impact bpo services to our clients 
our approach is to develop relationships with our clients that are partnering and collaborative in nature where we are focused  flexible and responsive to their business needs 
in addition we offer creative industry based solutions to meet our clients ever changing business needs 
the end result is the delivery of a quality customer experience to our client s customers 
to become a leader in the market  our strategy is to grow our existing client base by deepening and broadening our relationships  add new clients and continue to diversify our client base  improve the profitability of our business through operational improvements  increased utilization and right sizing our north american operation  expand our global delivery platform to meet our client needs  and broaden our service offerings by providing more innovative and technology enabled solutions 
during  we further expanded our near shore delivery platform by opening our first facility in honduras 
management believes that the labor market in honduras is strong and our position as an early entrant into this country provides us a competitive advantage to win business with new and existing customers 
during  we also continued to grow our headcount in the philippines  where we added over  new full time equivalent agents 
we believe that diversifying our geographic platform by expanding offshore and near shore will result in improved margins and position us for future growth 
in  we decreased our north american footprint by closing one facility in the us early in the year and one canadian facility in the third quarter of the decision to close these facilities was due to lower client volumes and an effort to improve utilization at our centers  thus driving efficiencies and improved margins 
we will continue to evaluate the profitability of our north american locations 
in  we made progress on our strategic objective to add new clients by signing eight new contracts 
we also built out startek advantage which builds upon the development of the startek operating platform in order to drive efficiencies in our operation  execute on our core offerings and deliver customized processes and solutions to our clients 
we operate within three business segments us  canada and offshore 
the business segments align with the regions in which our services are rendered 
as of december   our us segment included the operations of eight facilities in the us  our canada segment included the operations of two facilities in canada  and our offshore segment included the operations of two facilities in the philippines  one in costa rica and one in honduras 
as of december   there were nine  three and three facilities in the us  canada and offshore segments  respectively 
as of december   there were thirteen  five and one facilities in the us  canada and offshore segments  respectively 
we use gross profit as our measure of profit and loss for each business segment and do not allocate selling  general and administrative expenses to our business segments 
in and we received lower call volumes in our north american facilities  which adversely affected our results 
partially offsetting lower call volumes in north america has been strong demand for our offshore call center services  primarily in the philippines 
we have observed that our customers are decreasing the number of agents handling calls by leveraging call disposition technology and there continues to be a shift toward outsourced and offshore providers 
while the increased use of call disposition technology has somewhat adversely impacted our financial results  the shift toward outsourced and offshore providers has positively impacted our business due to our expanded presence in the philippines  costa rica and honduras 
part of our strategy as noted above is to further expand our geographic footprint offshore and near shore to capitalize on this trend and to diversify geographic risk 
we also believe our customers and potential customers are seeking front and back office business processes to increase operating efficiencies in order to enhance their customer experience 
we believe we are positioned to benefit from this trend as we have developed a comprehensive suite of services which includes front and back office offerings for our customers 
significant developments during the year ended december  new facilities one component of our strategy is to expand our global delivery platform by growing offshore and near shore 
management believes that expansion into targeted international locations will broaden our service delivery platform and build our competitive advantage 
in connection with this strategy  and in response to client demand for another latin america offering  we opened our first facility in honduras in september total lease commitments are approximately million over the initial term of the lease  which is approximately seven years 
site closures management made the decision to close the following sites during alexandria  louisiana in february  we closed our facility in alexandria  louisiana due to lower call volumes from our second largest client 
the closure coincided with our lease expiration  and as such we did not incur material impairment and restructuring charges 
the closure resulted in approximately million less revenue during compared to  and decreased gross profit by million  compared to kingston  ontario in september  we closed one of two facilities in kingston  ontario 
this was consistent with our strategy to right size our north american delivery platform and exit facilities as lease terms expire and local economic conditions  prevailing wage rates  foreign exchange rates  or other factors negatively impact the long term financial viability of a location 
the business that was serviced in this location was moved to another facility and  as such  this closure did not have an impact on revenue during we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of approximately million during the year ended december   of which approximately million was for severance payments 
other events in april  we announced a reduction of business in our cornwall  ontario facility and consequently renegotiated the facility lease for a smaller portion of the space through june  we incurred approximately million in restructuring and impairments costs associated with the downsizing during the year ended december  subsequent events in january  we announced that we would be consolidating the business performed in enid  oklahoma into another us facility 
the transition of the business is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of we are actively marketing this capacity to other current and potential clients 
however  if we are not successful in doing so  we may decide to close the facility 
in that event  we would not expect to incur material impairment and restructuring charges 
in february  we closed our facility in collinsville  virginia as a result of a customer notification  which we had announced in june since the announcement of this closure  we were under a month to month lease arrangement and do not expect to incur material impairment and restructuring charges associated with this closure 
in february  we received written customer notification of an intent to reduce its business in our decatur  illinois and jonesboro  arkansas facilities 
the reduction is expected to occur during the first quarter of and the early part of the second quarter of we are actively selling this capacity to other current and potential clients 
however  if we are not successful in doing so  we may decide to close one or both of these facilities 
in that event  there could be impairment and restructuring charges which would depend on which facilities are closed and when 
on february   we terminated our million secured line of credit with umb bank  which was effective through august   and replaced it with a secured revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank the credit agreement

we and wells fargo are required to agree on financial covenants for the remaining term of the credit agreement beyond  and any failure to do so will constitute an event of default
