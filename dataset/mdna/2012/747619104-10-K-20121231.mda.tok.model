description of business the company operates two businesses engineered products and aluminum sheet products 
the engineered products segment produces engineered systems  products and components primarily serving the window and door industry  while the aluminum sheet products segment produces mill finished and coated aluminum sheet serving the broader building products markets and secondary markets such as transportation 
on march   the company acquired edgetech for million in an all cash transaction net of cash acquired 
headquartered in cambridge  ohio  edgetech added three manufacturing facilities located in the united states  the united kingdom and germany that produce a full line of warm edge  dual seal insulating glass spacer systems for window and door customers in north america and abroad 
edgetech s products separate and seal double and triple pane glass within a window and act as a thermal barrier that enhances the window s energy efficiency 
edgetech was integrated into the engineered products segment 
acquiring edgetech allows the company to better serve its growing base of national and regional customers and will further accelerate its international growth as edgetech has a solid market presence overseas 
in march  the company also acquired jeld wen s vinyl extrusion assets in yakima  washington 
in january  management closed its finished window screen facility located in the dalles  oregon 
in november  management committed to a plan to consolidate its truseal and us edgetech operations 

table of contents the consolidation plan  in part  called for the permanent closing of the company s barbourville  kentucky facility with the equipment used to manufacture the single seal spacer system relocated to the company s cambridge  ohio facility 
the company believes this consolidation will allow it to better serve customers through streamlined operations 
the consolidation of operations and the subsequent closure of the barbourville facility were completed in august with minor residual cash payments expected in fiscal all equipment to be retained has been relocated  with the main outstanding activities only related to selling remaining equipment and the facility itself

exclusive of items shown separately below 
overview during fiscal  the company saw positive signs in the residential new construction market  including rising home starts  falling home inventory levels  and improving trends in home prices 
performance of the company s end markets varied as new construction continued on a path towards recovery while the repair and replacement r r segment retreated  a result of weakness in consumer confidence  unemployment and reduced availability of home equity lines of credit 
quanex believes the best indicator of the strength of its end markets is us window shipments as reported by ducker worldwide ducker  a market intelligence firm 
for the twelve months ended september   ducker reported new construction window shipments increased while repair and replacement window shipments declined approximately 
in total  ducker reported overall window shipments increased approximately 
this is challenging as quanex estimates about two thirds of its engineered products segment sales are related to the residential r r window market 
quanex is focused more on the repair and replacement segment due to it being a higher end product mix and a better fit for the company s value added products and services 
the lag in the repair and replacement segment is likely to continue as long as consumer confidence remains low  home equity loans are difficult to obtain and unemployment remains a concern 
the encouraging news is that the recent favorable trend in home prices is a clear positive sign that is needed for a recovery to begin in the repair and replacement segment 
the decline in quanex net sales for fiscal compared to the year ago period was entirely driven by reduced aluminum shipments and lower aluminum prices within the aluminum sheet products segment whose net sales declined by million 
table of contents during fiscal compared to fiscal the segment experienced a strike at two of nichols davenport  iowa facilities see further discussion in aluminum sheet products which had a significant negative impact on shipments 
ducker reported that total us window shipments for the twelve months ended september  increased while the company s engineered products segment experienced a increase in same store sales predominately related to higher vinyl extrusion sales 
same store sales reflect the net sales of edgetech  acquired on march   for only comparable months of the last twelve month period 
operating income declined for fiscal by million  compared to prior year  with the majority of the decrease at the aluminum sheet products segment 
fiscal was negatively impacted by the strike which resulted in direct strike related losses coupled with additional strike related inefficiencies  lower aluminum shipments and lower aluminum prices 
additionally  quanex incurred an increase in facility related consolidation expenses of million and higher erp implementation costs of million during fiscal compared to quanex outperformed in the face of difficult end markets in fiscal prime window demand dropped to new lows in to an estimated million units as measured by ducker for the twelve months ended september  while the first quarter of experienced demand pull forward in advance of the  window tax credit that expired on december   demand was lackluster for the remainder of the fiscal year as the building and construction market did not experience a meaningful spring bounce as is typical as the year progresses 
the figures include financial results from the edgetech acquisition beginning in april net sales increased in by million compared to the same period of last year of which million was driven by the edgetech acquisition 
despite weak end markets  same store revenues from engineered products were slightly higher compared to  supported by price increases and surcharges 
operating income for was million lower than due to lower aluminum sheet shipments  higher maintenance costs at aluminum sheet products  coupled with higher costs at engineered products associated with rationalizing operations  incremental sales and marketing costs as the company invested in long term organic growth initiatives  acquisition related costs  higher raw material costs and warranty expense 
window shipments have declined significantly in recent years from record highs in of million units to an estimated million in calendar the following table sets forth the annual calendar year market information from the peak to the current estimates housing starts window shipments starts millions change shipments millions change e as published by the national association of home builders 
as published by ducker worldwide 
while fiscal presented several challenges  in quanex is expecting improved operational performance at its aluminum sheet products business as the new management team pushes lean process initiatives and investments in equipment  maintenance reliability  and throughput 
quanex continues to drive productivity improvements  lower costs  customer service and growth in its regional customer base 
the company believes that consumer demand for more energy efficient products and its ability to provide innovative window and door systems in addition to stand alone components will fuel long term organic growth incremental to the housing market recovery 
the integration of edgetech into the engineered products sales and marketing organization was completed in september and it is clear that quanex is already a stronger  more customer focused organization as a result 
while quanex is cautious on the near term repair and remodel market  the company remains bullish long term as the existing housing stock ages and demographics for long term housing demand in the us remain favorable when factoring the projected population increase and continuing immigration 
the company believes taking a disciplined approach to the way it seeks new business opportunities will make it a more successful company and a stronger competitor by offering a broader range of customers a more robust slate of systems  products  services and solutions  while intensely focusing on continuously improving customer service 
additionally  the company continues to elevate its programs to develop more energy efficient products 
these 
table of contents programs and initiatives  coupled with an eventual return to a more normal new home construction market and r r market  will benefit quanex over the long term 
business segments business segments are reported in accordance with asc topic segment reporting asc 
asc requires that the company disclose certain information about its operating segments  where operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker codm in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
quanex has two reportable segments engineered products and aluminum sheet products 
the engineered products segment produces systems  finished products  and components serving the oem residential window and door industry  while the aluminum sheet products segment produces mill finished and coated aluminum sheet serving the broader residential building and construction markets 
the primary market drivers of both segments are residential repair and remodel r r activity and new home construction 
for financial reporting purposes  three of the company s four operating segments  engineered components  insulating glass ig and window door systems  have been aggregated into the engineered products reportable segment 
the remaining operating segment  aluminum sheet products nichols aluminum  is reported as a separate reportable segment 
corporate other is comprised of corporate office expenses and certain inter division eliminations 
the sale of products between segments is recognized at market prices 
the financial performance of the operations is based upon operating income 
the segments follow the accounting principles described in the summary of significant accounting principles  see item  note the two reportable segments value inventory on a fifo or weighted average basis while the lifo reserve relating to those operations accounted for under the lifo method of inventory valuation is computed on a consolidated basis in a single pool and treated as a corporate item

engineered products is focused on providing window and door oem customers with fenestration components  products and systems 
key end markets are residential r r and new home construction 
engineered products finished the year with sales up million or for fiscal compared to results include twelve months of edgetech sales in compared to seven months in as edgetech was acquired on march  representing approximately million of the year over year increase 
considering edgetech s partial year contribution  comparable net sales for year ended october  were higher than the comparable increase was primarily from higher vinyl fenestration extrusion sales as well as growth in international spacer sales 
a major oem customer that produces mid to high end wood and vinyl windows  gained significant market share this year at the big box stores by displacing a competitor that did not buy quanex extrusions  benefiting sales in international spacer sales for the second half of fiscal exceeded the same prior year period by as demand for warm edge spacer products is rising in european markets due to codes and standards 
the beginning of fiscal benefited from a pull forward of demand as a result of a  energy efficient window tax credit program that expired on december  there were no similar tax credits in fiscal the increase in comparable net sales exceeded industry performance as measured by ducker which reported overall us window shipments up only 
table of contents for the twelve months ended september  and window shipments associated with the repair and remodel window market down 
there were favorable signs in new home construction in fiscal  and indications are that a new recovery is underway 
us residential replacement window shipments  which drive an estimated two thirds of engineered products sales  were down in and a long term recovery is likely to take better hold once housing prices  credit availability and consumer confidence turn more positive 
net sales for fiscal exceeded the prior year period by million due to the march acquisition of edgetech 
edgetech contributed million in net sales in fiscal engineered products same store net sales were essentially flat in fiscal despite difficult end markets 
for the twelve months ended october   engineered products net sales before contributions from acquisitions were up compared to the previous twelve months  versus us window shipments as reported by ducker that were down approximately 
net sales less cost of sales contribution margin at engineered products for fiscal compared to last year improved by million 
the increase in contribution margin for over is predominately due to the higher vinyl extrusion sales in approximately half of the improvement in contribution margin for fiscal compared to the fiscal is from the rise in vinyl extrusion sales while approximately one third of the increase is related to a full year of edgetech sales in compared to seven months of edgetech business during the same period 
net sales less cost of sales as a percent of net sales for the year ended october  is higher than even with the weak market and pressure on volume 
increased revenues  combined with pricing initiatives  cost controls  productivity improvements  warranty benefits and purchase accounting costs strengthened margins 
one such pricing initiative was the oil based raw material surcharge initiated may  at truseal  one of the company s insulating glass spacer operations 
the surcharge helped truseal offset the higher cost of butyl  a key raw material of the business that is highly correlated to the price of oil 
fiscal margins were negatively impacted by customer mix and additional freight costs incurred to ship spacer product overseas to support the increase in international demand 
in  quanex consolidated buildings in kent  washington and closed a facility in the dalles  oregon 
of the million in plant consolidation costs  million is recognized in cost of sales benefiting the margin comparison 
fiscal year includes a warranty benefit of million from a change in warranty estimate for pre existing warranties due to a decline in claims experience 
the year ended october  reflects a million charge to increase the warranty reserve estimate associated with a legacy product that quanex discontinued some years ago  which also contributed to the year over year improvement in margins 
because the establishment of the warranty reserve is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of the number of future claims and the cost to settle claims  the company s ultimate losses may differ from the warranty reserve and future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary 
finally  results were negatively impacted by million of additional non cash cost of goods sold during due to the increased value of inventory sold from applying purchase accounting to the edgetech inventory acquired 
net sales less cost of sales contribution margin at engineered products for compared to improved by million including edgetech s contribution of million 
net sales less cost of sales as a percent of net sales for the year ended october  are slightly below the same period due to higher raw material costs and temporary increases in labor expense as the company used overtime to meet a hike in orders in november and december  additionally  the first fiscal quarter of benefited from hourly labor savings associated with the strike at the segment s barbourville  kentucky facility in mid december although engineered products experienced higher raw material costs in  these higher costs were generally offset by higher prices  the oil based raw material surcharge  cost controls and productivity improvements  which strengthened margins 
further reducing contribution margins during was the aforementioned million of plant consolidation costs  the million warranty expense  and million of purchase accounting costs recognized in cost of sales selling  general and administrative costs for the full fiscal year of were higher than fiscal due to the ig spacer consolidation project  a full twelve months of expense associated with the edgetech acquisition  and increased incentive wages 
on november   the company announced a consolidation program for its ig spacer manufacturing facility in barbourville  kentucky into its ig spacer manufacturing facility in cambridge  ohio 
the facility consolidation was completed ahead of schedule in august  and the barbourville facility is permanently closed 
total cash spending associated with the consolidation plan was approximately million excludes a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of million taken in the fourth quarter 
of the million of cash  total expenses to be recognized in selling  general and administrative costs were million for the project  comprised of million for employee related costs and million for plant closure  equipment moving and set up costs  substantially all of which will be charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
the company expects an estimated annual pre tax cash savings of million to begin in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs increased by million for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to more plant consolidation expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal the fiscal year selling  general and administrative costs include expenses of million associated with the company s ig spacer consolidation program compared to million included in the total million discussed above of costs associated with the aforementioned plant consolidations and closing during the first fiscal quarter of the majority of the million represents an estimated liability to terminate a facility operating lease  this estimated liability is net of an 
table of contents associated sublease benefit 
also  fiscal selling  general and administrative costs are higher than from the acquisition of edgetech in  which contributed million of the higher expenses 
in march  a portion of the roof collapsed at the barbourville  kentucky facility due to extreme weather 
customers had minimal service interruption as the clean up activities were well executed and equipment moves to cambridge were expedited 
the company did experience inefficiencies from the accelerated move and incurred costs of million associated with the roof collapse  including business interruption costs 
the company received a million insurance recovery resulting in a net gain of million primarily associated with insurance proceeds received on property and equipment that had been previously depreciated or impaired 
selling  general and administrative costs increased by million during fiscal compared to the prior year from the acquisition of edgetech which reported million of selling  general and administrative costs for additionally  the increase in selling  general and administrative costs for the year were attributable to million included in the total million discussed above of costs associated with the aforementioned plant consolidations and closing during the first fiscal quarter of furthermore  engineered products incurred additional sales and marketing expenses of million in associated with the roll out of new products and programs and increasing resources necessary to achieve long term organic growth  with a focus on expanding further into the regional segment of the residential market 
benefiting the comparative results is million of costs associated with the aforementioned strike in mid december partially offset by the direct labor savings in cost of sales as well as reduced incentives corresponding to lower earnings 
the company recorded million of impairment charges in fiscal of which million relates to the barbourville roof and building 
the company initially recorded a million non cash asset impairment charge on its barbourville  kentucky real property during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to its plan to consolidate its insulating glass operations 
depreciation and amortization increased for fiscal compared to and in compared to primarily due to the acquisition of edgetech on march  in fiscal  edgetech had a full year of expense and contributed million higher depreciation and amortization over in fiscal  edgetech incurred million seven months in deprecation and amortization 
partially offsetting the increase for the year ended ended october  compared to was million included in the million discussed above of accelerated depreciation related to the plant consolidations recognized in the first quarter of engineered products fiscal operating income declined compared to by million 
while the results benefited from the increase in vinyl extrusion sales and favorable changes in warranty estimates  the reported results and margins were negatively impacted by the aforementioned ig spacer consolidation program as well as the company s start up spacer facility in germany and reduced higher margin non fenestration ig sales 
fiscal saw million in ig consolidation expense compared to million of combined facility consolidation in the company continues to believe that investments in growth opportunities like its germany facility and plant consolidations like the ig consolidation program will have long term benefits that will outweigh these current year costs and lead to revenue growth and margin improvements in future years 
operating income for fiscal was down by million of which million is attributable to the edgetech operating loss since acquisition in operating income for the remaining engineered products businesses for fiscal was below prior year levels primarily due to weak end markets and rising material costs as well as negative impacts from current year costs to consolidate facilities  warranty expense associated with legacy products and incremental sales and marketing investment to support engineered products organic growth initiatives 
the fiscal edgetech operating loss was driven by production start up costs at its germany facility as well as inventory step up expenses from acquisition accounting 
fiscal comparable net sales increased  during fiscal compared to from the strong performance of vinyl fenestration extrusions and increased international spacer sales 
engineered products long term organic growth programs are focused on driving profitable growth through a single sales and marketing team that is intensely focused on driving continuous improvement of customer satisfaction 
the company believes this will drive profitable growth at engineered products by furthering the goal of becoming the leading energy efficiency expert in the market by offering customers state of the art engineering  design and marketing support 
while the company believes that it is competitively strong in its energy efficient product offerings  the higher price points often associated with these higher end products may limit sales volumes in these times of tight credit conditions and low consumer confidence 
engineered products is in the early stages of its long term organic growth initiatives but believes they will have a meaningful impact on its long term growth and profitability

net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative asset impairment charges depreciation and amortization operating income loss operating income loss margin shipped pounds exclusive of items shown separately below 
the primary market drivers for the aluminum sheet products segment are residential repair and remodel activity and new home construction together approximately of the segment s sales and transportation approximately of the segment s sales markets 
fiscal was one of the most challenging years in nichols history 
the aluminum sheet products segment started fiscal off poorly with quality issues at the alabama paint facility and weak demand as customers destocked inventory 
then  on january   nichols aluminum experienced a strike by about bargaining unit employees at its two facilities located in davenport  iowa 
during the second quarter  nichols offered permanent positions to the approximately temporary employees it hired since the strike began  and the majority of those employees accepted a full time position 
shortly after that action  the union ended its strike 
a new five year agreement was eventually ratified in september fiscal was negatively impacted by this strike which resulted in direct strike related losses coupled with additional inefficiencies that were experienced even after the strike ended in april but prior to the ratification of the new agreement 
another significant contributing factor to the operating income decline was the reduced spread realized that was generally the result of lower global london metal exchange lme aluminum prices in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in net sales at the aluminum sheet products segment for fiscal was the result of an decrease in shipments and a decrease in average selling price compared to fiscal shipments were down million pounds in from due to reduced production related to the second quarter strike reliability and quality issues and weaker end demand experienced early in the fiscal year from the absence of the window tax credit program compared to the available program in the company estimates that approximately one half of the fiscal year s volume decline is attributable to the strike 
the aluminum association  which tracks aluminum industry shipments of sheet products  reported non can sheet aluminum shipments during fiscal were up from a year ago  while aluminum sheet products shipments were down 
nichols underperformance is primarily attributed to the impact of the strike as well as facility performance issues and relatively weaker residential demand  where it has a large presence  compared to relatively stronger distribution and transportation demand  where it has a smaller presence 
average selling price decreased primarily due to lower lme aluminum prices in the comparative periods 
lme aluminum prices are the most commonly used index for correlating aluminum sheet prices and have averaged around cents per pound in fiscal compared to about per pound in the prior year 
net sales were negatively impacted by a decline in shipped pounds of for the year compared to the same period of due to weaker demand for building and construction sheet 
the aluminum association reported non can sheet aluminum shipments for year to date october up from the prior year  while aluminum sheet products shipments were down 
part of the company s underperformance versus the industry can be attributed to relatively weaker building and construction demand compared to stronger distribution and transportation demand 
this decrease in net sales at the aluminum sheet products segment for was partially offset by a increase in average selling price per pound compared to average selling price increased primarily due to higher lme aluminum prices in the comparative period 
selling  general and administrative costs increased by million for fiscal compared to primarily due to million of strike expenses as well as employee related expenses incurred during the strike costs are directly associated with the negotiating activities themselves and include such items as legal fees and security 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased by million for compared to the decrease in expense is primarily due to a million expense in associated with the discontinuation of a new microsoft dynamics ax enterprise resource planning system for the segment  a million decline in environmental related expense  and to a lesser extent a decrease in variable pay incentives associated with a lower level of earnings in for additional information on the environmental reserve  see note  contingencies 
table of contents in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
depreciation and amortization has declined for fiscal compared to the same period primarily due to equipment reaching the end of its depreciable life and accelerated depreciation during the first quarter of fiscal related to the reduction of an asset s remaining useful life 
operating income decreased at the aluminum sheet products segment for fiscal  compared to the prior year due to reduced volume  higher costs associated with purchasing semi finished aluminum coils from third parties  higher conversion costs associated with the processing of semi finished coils into finished sheet  and the impact of a lower spread sales less material costs associated with a general reduction in lme aluminum prices 
additionally  repair and maintenance expenses were million higher in fiscal than as the business incurred various equipment outages during the year and also used more outside contractors for repairs than in prior years 
while the reduced shipments impacted the results for the year  the decline in aluminum spread  which is calculated as the difference between the average sales price and the average raw material cost  negatively impacted the year over year results 
spread declined by in fiscal compared to the segment s operating income and margins are impacted by changes in lme aluminum prices as its spread is correlated with aluminum prices over time 
declines in aluminum prices generally result in spread compression  however  as aluminum prices rebound  spread and profits generally expand 
with lme aluminum prices averaging around cents per pound a drop from a year ago  and without a corresponding decline in aluminum scrap costs  nichols spread in has been dramatically reduced from last year 
this means that aluminum scrap costs are expensive relative to the lme price of aluminum 
also  in an attempt to meet improving demand  nichols purchased semi finished aluminum coils from third parties to help make up for reduced casting capacity from the strike 
third party coils are expensive relative to nichols internal cost of production  and third party coils require additional finishing 
nichols is a high fixed cost business  so as its shipments drop  its ability to substantially reduce operating costs is limited 
in fiscal  estimated direct expenses associated with the strike were approximately million and the volume related operating income impact in the second quarter and impacting fiscal results is estimated at about million for total strike related expenses of million 
the net direct expenses of million for fiscal represent the aforementioned costs associated with the purchase of semi finished aluminum coils from third parties and to a lesser extent include outside maintenance  legal fees  security costs and incremental expenses associated with the salary workforce that stepped in to continue to keep the two facilities operating  estimated labor savings are included as a benefit in the net direct expenses figure 
although the strike hurt the results  quanex believes the outcome has improved the competitiveness of the nichols business and will benefit the overall long term position of the company 
operating income decreased at the aluminum sheet products segment for  compared to prior year due to lower shipped pounds and to a lesser extent lower painted sales 
the aluminum sheet products segment is a high fixed cost business  so as shipments drop due to weaker demand  its ability to substantially reduce operating costs is limited 
operating income was further impacted by high repair and maintenance expenses and to a lesser extent by higher energy costs and higher freight costs 
repair and maintenance expense in increased by million over the same period in part due to projects that were previously deferred in prior years 
this decline in operating income was partially offset by an increase in spread sales price less material costs 
the higher spread compared to the previous year was primarily a result of higher aluminum prices that rose faster than material costs

lifo adjustments are reported in corporate cost of sales 
the company incurred lifo income of million in fiscal and lifo expense of million and million in fiscal and fiscal year  respectively 
lifo income was incurred in fiscal primarily due to a fall in pricing of aluminum while lifo expense was incurred in fiscal and primarily due to a rise in pricing of aluminum based inventory held by the company at year end

fiscal selling  general  and administrative expense includes a million increase in estimated workers compensation self insurance reserves partially associated with higher open claims with limited development experience 
selling  general and administrative costs in also reflect various other programs including lean six sigma employee training that the company believes will result in future cost savings 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decline during fiscal in mark to market expense associated with the deferred compensation plan reflecting the decrease in the company s stock price as well as the market value of other investments held by the deferred compensation plan during the period 
as of october   approximately of the deferred compensation plan balance was indexed to the company s stock price  and the quanex stock price decreased by per share during fiscal compared to an increase of per share during fiscal additionally  selling  general and administrative costs have declined in from lower estimated variable pay incentive costs corresponding to the company s lower earnings
