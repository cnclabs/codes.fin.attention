item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these risks are not the only risks the company faces  and other risks include those not presently known as well as those that are currently considered to be less significant 
major business risks the company s subsidiaries have substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s primary sources of funding for working capital requirements are cash flow from operations and banking facilities 
the company s liquidity is affected by many factors  including some that are based on normal operations and some that are related to the industries in which the company operates and the economy generally 
the company s media services businesses finance their operations in part through a revolving credit facility defined below as the media services credit facility that matures may  the company s media services businesses also rely on cash flow from operations and operate with negative working capital  primarily as a result of liquidity provided by one material customer contract that expires june amrep southwest finances its business from cash flow from operations  which has been minimal in and due to the poor conditions in its real estate markets  and from parent company advances 
it also has a loan agreement that matures september  under which it may not borrow any additional funds 
the company is a holding company  and is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it 
the company is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries 
as a holding company  the company is dependent on distributions of funds from its subsidiaries to pay its expenses and fund its operations 
because of the adverse conditions currently affecting amrep southwest  media services is presently the sole source of funding for the parent company s operations  and the parent company in turn is supplying a substantial portion of the funding needed by amrep southwest 
the continued availability of this funding is dependent upon the results of operations of media services and its continued compliance with the covenants in its revolving credit facility 
the company s results of operations  future growth or both would be adversely affected if for any reason media services were unable to distribute sufficient funds to support the operations of the company and amrep southwest 
if the cash available for distribution by media services were insufficient to fund the operations of the company and the company was not able to provide the funding needed by amrep southwest  the company would be forced to seek either replacement financing or other sources of capital  such as by selling assets or issuing equity  which replacement financing or other sources of capital might not be available on acceptable terms 
the media services credit facility requires the borrowers to meet certain covenants  including maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined 
the borrowers were not in compliance with this covenant at april  the lender has waived the violation and the media services credit facility was amended to reduce the required fixed charge coverage ratio for the period ending july  to a level that the company believes will be met 
the company believes that without additional changes  it is likely that there will be subsequent violations of this covenant 
however  the lender has agreed in principle to a further amendment of the media services credit facility  which is in the process of being documented 
the proposed amendment would extend the media services credit facility s term for one year to may  and modify the required fixed charge coverage ratio so that it would more likely be met 
however  neither meeting the covenant s requirement in the future nor obtaining relief from the lender if it is not met can be assured 
under the terms of the media services credit facility  while a violation of the covenant continues  among other things  the media services companies are barred from repaying indebtedness to or otherwise distributing funds to the parent company and the lender is entitled to terminate the media services credit facility and seek immediate payment of any outstanding borrowing 
at april   the borrowers were in compliance with the other covenants of the media services credit facility 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the media services credit facility as of april  it is likely that the expiration without renewal or extension  or the termination  of either of the credit facilities described in this and the preceding risk factor or the customer contract described in the preceding risk factor would have a material adverse effect on the company 
a the company s defined benefit pension plan  which the company froze in  is currently substantially underfunded and will require additional cash contributions  some of which are likely to be accelerated 
the company s defined benefit pension plan was underfunded on a generally accepted accounting principles basis by approximately million at april  the company froze the pension plan effective march  so that from that date there would be no new participants in the plan and the existing participants future compensation would not affect their pension benefits 
a key assumption underlying the actuarial calculations upon which the company s accounting and reporting obligations for the pension plan are based is an assumed annual investment rate of return of 
if the pension plan assets do not realize the expected rate of return  or if any other assumptions underlying the actuarial calculations are incorrect or are modified  the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plan beyond current requirements  which could negatively impact the company s limited financial resources 
in addition  due to the closing of certain facilities in connection with the consolidation of the company s subscription fulfillment services business and the associated work force reduction  the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  and the regulations thereunder have accorded to the pension benefit guaranty corporation the pbgc the right to require the company to accelerate the funding of approximately  of accrued pension related obligations 
the company and the pbgc have reached an agreement in principle to deal with the funding obligation which provides for the company to make a  cash contribution to the plan  which is to be made within ten days after a formal agreement is signed 
if  before the expiration of one year  the company is unable to pay the remaining liability or adequately secure it with collateral acceptable to the pbgc  the company will be required to i provide a letter of credit equal to of the remaining liability or establish a cash escrow for of the remaining liability  or ii discharge the remaining liability in quarterly installments over a five year period with security acceptable to the pbgc 
in the event the company fails to meet the terms of the agreement  the pbgc could seek immediate payment of the amount due or attempt to force a termination of the plan 
the company is unable to offer any assurance that it will be able to discharge the plan funding obligation within one year or meet the pbgc s requirements for securing or paying the undischarged amount  nor can it offer any assurance that upon such inability it will be able to negotiate with the pbgc to obtain further relief 
risks related to the company s media services operations the introduction and increased popularity of alternative technologies for the distribution of news  entertainment and other information and the resulting shift in consumer habits and advertising expenditures from print to other media has adversely affected the company s media services operations 
revenues in the company s media services operations are principally derived from services the company performs for traditional publishers 
historically  a reduction in the demand for the company s newsstand distribution services due to lower sales of magazines at newsstands has often been at least partially offset by an increase in demand for the company s subscription fulfillment services as consumers affected by the reduction in newsstand distribution instead sought publications through subscription 
however  technology changes  particularly digital technology used in the entertainment and media industries  continues to evolve rapidly  and advances in that technology have led to alternative methods for the distribution  storage and consumption of content such as that contained in the products distributed by the company s media services operations 
these technological changes have driven and reinforced changes in consumer behavior as consumers increasingly seek control over when  where and how they consume content 
for example  the distribution of news  entertainment and other information via the internet has become very popular  and consumers increasingly rely on electronic tablets and readers  personal computers  cellular phones and other electronic devices for such information 
the resulting reduction in demand for traditional print media and the shift of advertising dollars from traditional print media to online media has adversely affected the publishing industry in general and has had a negative impact on both the company s subscription fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services business segments 
the company s failure or inability to adapt to emerging technologies and changes in consumer behavior could have a significant adverse effect on the company s competitive position and its businesses and results of operations 
a the company s operating results depend in part on successful research  development and marketing of new or improved services and data processing capabilities and could suffer if the company is not able to continue to successfully implement new technologies 
the company s media services businesses operate in highly competitive markets that are subject to rapid change  and must therefore continue to invest in developing technologies and improving various existing systems in order to remain competitive 
there are substantial uncertainties associated with the company s efforts to develop new technologies and services for the subscription fulfillment and newsstand distribution markets the company serves  including its lack of financial resources 
particularly in the subscription fulfillment services business  the company would need to make substantial capital investments in order to convert its business to newer digital and internet based technologies 
some of the company s competitors have already adjusted their businesses for the growing digital market and any improvements the company makes may not be developed until it is too late to compete effectively 
additionally  the cost and expertise needed to develop these new digital and internet based technologies may be prohibitive for the company  and even if the company makes significant investments in new information processing technologies and services in these or other areas  they may not prove to be profitable 
the failure or inability to successfully develop these new technologies and services could have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position and its businesses and results of operations 
even if these developments are profitable  the operating margins resulting from their application would not necessarily equal  or result in an improvement over  the company s historical margins 
the company s media services operations could face increased costs and business disruption from instability in the newsstand distribution channel 
the company s newsstand distribution services business operates a national distribution business that relies on wholesalers to distribute magazines to newsstands and other retail outlets 
a small number of wholesalers are responsible for a substantial percentage of the wholesale magazine distribution business in the united states  and the company extends credit to such wholesalers  whose credit worthiness and financial position may be affected by changes in economic or other external conditions 
in recent years there has been instability in the wholesaler channel that has led to one major wholesaler abandoning the business and to certain disruptions to magazine distribution 
there is the possibility of further consolidation among these major wholesalers  and the insolvency or non payment of its obligations by one or more of these wholesalers would have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  due to the significant concentration in the industry  should there be a disruption in the wholesale channel  it could impede the company s ability to distribute magazines to the retail marketplace 
the company s publisher customers face business pressures from reduced advertising revenues and increased costs for paper  printing and postal rates 
these factors could have a negative effect on their operating income  and this in turn could negatively affect the company s media services operations 
an important source of revenue for the magazine publishing industry  the principal industry served by the company  is advertising 
as a result of the recent economic slowdown  there was a well publicized reduction in advertising at all levels which caused a higher attrition rate of magazine titles than had been previously experienced 
in addition  the company s publisher customers principal raw material is paper 
paper and printing prices have fluctuated over the past several years  and significant increases in paper prices could adversely affect a publisher customer s operating income 
postage for magazine distribution and direct solicitation is another significant operating expense of the company s publisher customers  which primarily use the us postal service to distribute their products 
any softness in advertising revenues or significant increases in paper costs  printing costs or postal rates that publishers are not able to offset could have a negative effect on their operating income and number of titles published  and this in turn could negatively affect the company s media services operations 
almost all of the revenues of the company s newsstand distribution services business are derived from sales made on a fully returnable basis  and an error in estimating expected returns could cause a misstatement of revenues for the period affected 
as is customary in the magazine distribution industry  almost all of the commission revenues of the company s newsstand distribution services business segment are derived from sales made on a fully returnable basis  meaning that customers may return unsold copies of magazines for credit 
during the company s last two fiscal years  customers ultimately returned for credit approximately of the magazines initially distributed by the company 
the company recognizes commission revenues from the distribution of magazines at the time of delivery to the a wholesalers  less a reserve for estimated returns that is based on historical experience and recent sales data on an issue by issue basis 
although the company has the contractual right to return these magazines for offsetting credits from the publishers from whom the magazines are purchased  an error in estimating the percentage of returns at the end of an accounting period could have the effect of understating or overstating revenues in the period affected  which misstatement would have to be adjusted in a subsequent period when the actual return information becomes known 
competitive pressures may result in a decrease in the media services revenues and profitability 
the subscription fulfillment and newsstand distribution services businesses are highly competitive  and some of the company s competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than the company s 
the company experiences significant price competition in the markets in which it competes 
competition in the company s media services businesses may come not only from other service providers  but also from the company s customers  who may choose to develop their own internal subscription fulfillment or newsstand distribution operations  thereby reducing demand for the company s services 
competitive pressures could cause the company s media services businesses to lose market share or result in significant price erosion that could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company may not be able to successfully introduce new services and data processing capabilities on a timely and cost effective basis 
the success of new and improved services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by the publishers and other customers with whom the company conducts business 
the company s media services businesses are affected  to varying degrees  by technological changes and shifts in customer demand 
these changes result in the transition of services provided and increase the importance of being first to market with new services and information processing innovations 
the company may not have the financial and other resources necessary to successfully and timely develop such services or innovations 
difficulties or delays in the development  production or marketing of new services and information processing capabilities may be experienced  and may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
these difficulties and delays could also prevent the company from realizing a reasonable return on the investment required to bring new services and information processing capabilities to market on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company s operations could be disrupted if its information systems fail  causing increased expenses and loss of sales 
the company s business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its systems and communications capabilities  including the maintenance of customer databases for billing and label processing  and the company s magazine distribution order regulation system 
if a key system were to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason  even if only for a short period  the company s operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
the company s systems could be damaged or interrupted by a security breach  fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar event 
the company has a disaster recovery plan in place  but this plan may not prevent delays or other complications that could arise from an information systems failure 
the company s business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate the company for losses that may occur 
the company depends on the internet to deliver some services  which may expose the company to various risks 
many of the company s operations and services  including order taking on behalf of customers and communications with customers and suppliers  involve the use of the internet 
the company is therefore subject to factors that adversely affect internet usage  including the reliability of internet service providers that from time to time may have operational problems and experience service outages 
additionally  as the company continues to increase the services it provides using the internet  the company is increasingly subject to risks related to the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
failure to prevent security breaches of the company s networks or those of its customers  or a security breach affecting the internet in general  could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company is subject to extensive rules and regulations of credit card associations 
the company processes a large number of credit card transactions on behalf of its subscription fulfillment services customers and is thus subject to the extensive rules and regulations of the leading credit card associations 
the card a associations modify their rules and regulations from time to time  and the company s inability to anticipate changes in such rules and regulations or in the interpretation or application thereof may result in substantial disruption to its business 
in the event that the card associations or the sponsoring banks determine that the manner in which the company processes certain credit card transactions is not in compliance with existing rules and regulations  or if the card associations adopt new rules or regulations that prohibit or restrict the manner in which the company processes credit card transactions  the company may be subject to substantial penalties and fines and be forced to modify the manner in which it operates  which may increase costs  or to cease processing certain types of transactions altogether  any of which could have a negative impact on its business 
changes relating to consumer information collection and use could adversely affect the company s ability to collect and use data  which could harm its business 
public concern over methods of information gathering has led to the enactment of legislation in most jurisdictions that restricts the collection and use of consumer information 
the company engages in the collection and use of consumer information in connection with its clients businesses and the company s growing digital efforts 
further legislation  government regulations  industry regulations  the issuance of judicial interpretations or a change in customs relating to the collection  management  aggregation and use of consumer information could materially increase the cost of collecting that data  or limit the company s ability to provide information to its customers or otherwise utilize telemarketing or e mail marketing or distribute the company s digital products across multiple platforms  and could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company faces government regulation and legal uncertainties related to internet communications  commerce and privacy regulation 
the growth and development of the market for internet commerce and communications has prompted both federal and state laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information including consumer credit and financial information  consumer protection  the content of online publications  the taxation of online transactions and the transmission of unsolicited commercial email  popularly known as spam 
more laws and regulations are under consideration by various governments  agencies and industry self regulatory groups 
although our compliance with applicable federal and state laws  regulations and industry guidelines has not had a material adverse effect on us  new laws and regulations may be introduced and modifications to existing laws may be enacted that require us to make changes to our business practices 
although the company believes that its practices are in compliance with applicable laws  regulations and policies  if the company were required to defend its practices against investigations of state or federal agencies or if its practices were deemed to be violative of applicable laws  regulations or policies  the company could be penalized and some of its activities could be enjoined 
any of the foregoing could increase the cost of conducting online activities  decrease demand for the company s services  and lessen the company s ability to effectively market its services  or otherwise materially adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the company s real estate operations the company s real estate assets are concentrated in one market  rio rancho  new mexico  so that the company s results of operations and future growth may be limited or affected by economic changes in that market 
substantially all of the company s real estate assets are located in rio rancho  which is adjacent to albuquerque  new mexico 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the company has been and will be affected by changes in economic conditions that occur in this region from time to time  including regional economic contraction due to  among other things  the failure or downturn of key industries and employers 
the company s results of operations  future growth or both may be further adversely affected if the regional demand for residential and commercial real estate remains at the current historically low levels due to the prolonged severe decline in the real estate market in the greater albuquerque metro and rio rancho areas 
real estate land sales have declined from  acres sold by the company in fiscal to acres sold in fiscal  with a low of acres in fiscal  as builders have slowed the pace of building on developed lots previously purchased from the company in rio rancho and delayed or cancelled the purchase of additional developed lots 
a a downturn in the business of rio rancho s largest employer may adversely affect the company s real estate development business there 
intel corporation intel is the largest employer in rio rancho and operates a large semiconductor manufacturing facility there 
although intel has made substantial investments in the rio rancho plant in recent years  it has reduced its employment there from approximately  at april  to approximately  at april  if intel s presence in rio rancho were to continue to diminish for any reason  such as in response to a downturn in its semiconductor manufacturing business or as a result of the relocation of its operations conducted there to another location  the rio rancho real estate market and the company s land development business would likely be adversely affected 
as rio rancho s population continues to grow  the company s land development activities in that market may be subject to greater limitations than they have been historically 
when the company acquired its core real estate inventory in rio rancho nearly years ago  the area was not developed and had a small population 
as of april   rio rancho was the third largest city in new mexico with a population of approximately  as rio rancho s population continues to grow  the company may be unable to engage in development activities comparable to those the company has engaged in historically 
local community or political groups may oppose the company s development plans or require modification of those plans  which could cause delays or increase the cost of the company s development projects 
in addition  zoning density limitations  slow growth provisions or other land use regulations implemented by state  city or local governments could further restrict the company s development activities or those of its homebuilder customers  or could adversely affect financial returns from a given project  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
much of the company s remaining rio rancho real estate is not in contiguous properties  which may adversely affect the company s ability to sell lots at levels comparable with the levels it experienced prior to the sales downturn 
of the approximately  acres in rio rancho that the company owned at april   approximately  acres were in several areas of contiguous properties that are being developed or are suitable for development  and approximately  acres were in areas with a high concentration of ownership  where the company owns more than of the lots in the area  suitable for special assessment districts or city redevelopment areas that may allow for future development under the auspices of local government 
the balance is in scattered lots  where the company owns less than of the lots in the area  which may require the purchase of a sufficient number of adjoining lots to create tracts suitable for development or that the company may offer for sale individually or in small groups 
as the company s land sales continue and the number of the company s contiguous and highly concentrated lots diminishes  the company s ability to continue to be in a position to sell lots and generate land sale revenues at satisfactory levels may be adversely affected  which would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s real estate assets are diminishing over time  meaning long term growth in the real estate business will require the acquisition of additional real estate assets  possibly by expanding into new markets 
substantially all of the company s real estate revenues are derived from sales of the company s core inventory in rio rancho 
this property was acquired nearly years ago  and each time the company develops and sells real estate to customers in rio rancho  the company s real estate assets diminish 
as of april   the company owned approximately  acres in rio rancho out of an original purchase of approximately  acres 
the continuity and future growth of the company s real estate business  if such growth is pursued by the company  will require that the company acquire new properties in or near rio rancho or expand to other markets to provide sufficient assets to support a meaningful real estate development business 
while the company holds two properties in colorado  it has not for many years made any significant attempt to identify a development opportunity similar to the one the company has undertaken in rio rancho and has no current plans to do so 
if the company does not acquire new real estate assets  its real estate holdings will continue to diminish  which will adversely affect the company s ability to continue its real estate operations 
a the company may not be able to acquire properties or develop them successfully 
if the company elects to pursue and is able to identify real estate development opportunities outside of rio rancho  the success of the company s real estate segment will depend in large part upon its ability to acquire additional properties on satisfactory terms and to develop them successfully 
if the company is unable to do so  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
the acquisition  ownership and development of real estate is subject to many risks that may adversely affect the company s results of operations  including risks that the company may not be able to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate developers or investors who may have greater capital or better access to cash than the company has  the company may not be able to obtain or renew financing on acceptable terms  or at all  an adverse change in market conditions during the interval between acquisition and sale of a property may result in a lower than originally anticipated profit  the company may underestimate the cost of development required to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property  acquired properties may be located in new markets where the company may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy  a lack of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures  and the company may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions  particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties  into its existing operations 
the company s real estate development activities have been primarily limited to a single market  and it may face substantially more experienced competition in acquiring and developing real estate in new markets 
since the company s real estate acquisition and development activities have been primarily limited to the rio rancho market  the company does not have extensive experience in acquiring real estate in other markets or engaging in development activities in multiple markets simultaneously 
should the company seek to acquire additional real estate in new markets  competition from other potential purchasers of real estate could adversely affect the company s operations 
many of these entities may have substantially greater experience than the company has in identifying  acquiring and developing real estate opportunities in other markets and in managing real estate developments in multiple markets 
these entities may also have greater financial resources than the company has and may be able to pay more than the company can or accept more risk than the company is willing to accept to acquire real estate 
these entities also may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the costs or the geographic concentration of their investments 
this competition may prevent the company from acquiring the real estate assets the company seeks  or increase the cost of properties that the company does acquire 
competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to the company or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell 
the company will likely compete for real estate investment opportunities with  among others  insurance companies  pension and investment funds  partnerships  real estate and housing developers  investment companies  real estate investment trusts and owner occupants 
properties that the company acquires may have defects that are unknown to the company 
although the company would expect to perform due diligence on prospective properties before they are acquired  and on a periodic basis after acquisition  any of the properties the company may acquire may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to the company that could adversely affect the property s value or revenue potential or  in the case of environmental or other factors  impose liability on the company  which could be significant 
a the company is subject to substantial legal  regulatory and other requirements regarding the development of land and requires government approvals  which may be delayed or denied  and thus the company may encounter difficulties in obtaining entitlements on a timely basis  which could limit its ability to sell land 
there are many legal  regulatory and other requirements regarding the development of land  which may delay the start of planned development activities  increase the company s expenses or limit the company s customers development activities 
development activities performed in connection with real estate sales include obtaining necessary governmental approvals  acquiring access to water supplies  installing utilities and necessary storm drains and building or improving roads 
numerous local  state and federal statutes  ordinances and rules and regulations  including those concerning zoning  resource protection and the environment  regulate these tasks 
these regulations often provide broad discretion to the governmental authorities that regulate these matters and from whom the company must obtain necessary approvals 
the approval process can be lengthy and delays can increase the company s costs  as well as the costs for the primary customers of the company s real estate business residential and commercial developers 
failure to obtain necessary approvals on a timely basis may significantly adversely affect the company s real estate development activities and its results of operations 
the company may be subject to environmental liability 
various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners and operators for the costs of investigating  cleaning up and removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property 
in the company s role as a property owner or developer  the company could be held liable for such costs 
this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether the company knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
if the company fails to disclose environmental issues  it could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of the property 
in addition  some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred by the government in connection with the contamination 
if the company incurs any such liability that is material  its results of operations would be adversely affected 
increases in taxes or governmental fees may increase the company s costs 
also  adverse changes in tax laws could reduce customer demand for land for commercial and residential development 
increases in real estate taxes and other local governmental fees  such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools  open space and road improvements or to provide low and moderate income housing  would increase the company s costs and have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
municipal and state resources have been particularly strained as a consequence of the economic downturn that began in and as a result  many governmental entities have adopted significant tax increases 
the company cannot control these tax increases and may not be able to pass such increased costs on to purchasers  particularly as it holds property for many years 
in addition  further increases in local real estate taxes or changes in income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives related to real estate would increase the company s expenses and could adversely affect homebuilders potential customer demand and could adversely affect future land sales by the company to those homebuilders 
unless the city of rio rancho supplements its current water supply  development of the company s remaining rio rancho land may be adversely affected 
all of the company s future rio rancho land development will require water service from the city of rio rancho or from another source 
while the city has not denied any development in the past due to a shortage of water supply  it has expressed concerns that its current water supply cannot support growth indefinitely 
although the city is currently pursuing various methods to supplement its water supply  if it is unsuccessful  development of the company s remaining rio rancho land could be adversely affected 
real estate is a cyclical industry  and the company s results of operations could be adversely affected during cyclical downturns in the industry 
during periods of economic expansion  the real estate industry typically benefits from an increased demand for land 
in contrast  during periods of economic contraction  the real estate industry is typically adversely affected by a decline in demand for land 
for example  increased rates of mortgage defaults that began in early calendar led to significant losses for the companies holding such mortgages and contributed to a severe and continuing downturn in the residential housing market 
further  real estate development projects typically begin  and financial and other resources are committed  long before such projects come to market  which could be during a time when the real a estate market is depressed 
there can be no assurance that an increase in demand or an economic expansion will occur or be sustained in the rio rancho market  where the company s core real estate business is based and operates  or in any new market into which the company expands its real estate operations 
any of the following among other factors  including those mentioned elsewhere in these risk factors could cause a general decline in the demand for residential or commercial real estate which  in turn  could contribute to a downturn in the real estate development industry that could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations periods of general economic slowdown or recession  change or uncertainty in government regulation  rising interest rates or a decline in the general availability or affordability of mortgage financing  adverse changes in local or regional economic conditions  shifts in population away from the markets that the company serves  tax law changes  including potential limits on  or elimination of  the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expense  real property taxes and employee relocation expenses  and uncertainty with respect to these matters  or acts of god  including hurricanes  earthquakes and other natural disasters 
changing market conditions may adversely affect companies in the real estate industry  which rely upon credit in order to finance their purchases of land from the company 
changes in interest rates and other economic factors can dramatically affect the availability of capital for the company s developer customers 
residential and commercial developers to whom the company frequently sells land typically rely upon third party financing to provide the capital necessary for their acquisition of land 
changes in economic and other external market conditions can and have resulted in the inability of developers to obtain suitable financing  which has  and so long as these circumstances continue will  adversely impact the company s ability to sell land and could force the company to sell land at lower prices  which would adversely affect its results of operations 
changes in general economic  real estate development or other business conditions may adversely affect the company s business and its financial results 
a significant percentage of the company s real estate revenues have historically been derived from customers in the residential homebuilding business  which is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and factors such as the level of employment  consumer confidence  consumer income  availability of mortgage financing and interest rates 
adverse changes in these conditions have decreased demand for homes generally  and may continue to do so  adversely affecting the pricing of homes and in turn the price of land sold to developers  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
a number of contracts for individual rio rancho home site sales made prior to require the company to exchange land in an area that is serviced by utilities for land in areas where utilities are not installed 
in connection with certain individual rio rancho home site sales made prior to  if water  electric and telephone utilities have not reached the lot site when a purchaser is ready to build a home  the company is obligated to exchange a lot in an area then serviced by such utilities for the lot of the purchaser  without cost to the purchaser 
although this has not been the case in the past  if the company were to experience a large number of requests for such exchanges in the future  the company s results of operations could be adversely impacted 
if subcontractors are not available to assist in completing the company s land development projects  the company may not be able to complete those projects on a timely basis 
the development of land on a timely basis is critical to the company s ability to complete development projects in accordance with the company s contractual obligations 
the availability of subcontractors in the markets in which the company operates can be affected by factors beyond the company s control  including the general demand for these subcontractors by other developers 
if subcontractors are not available when the company requires their services  the company may experience delays or be forced to seek alternative suppliers  which may increase costs or adversely affect the company s ability to sell land on a timely basis 
a land investments are generally illiquid  and the company may not be able to sell the company s properties when it is economically or otherwise important to do so 
land investments generally cannot be sold quickly  and the company s ability to sell properties has been and may continue to be affected by market conditions 
the company may not be able to diversify or vary its portfolio promptly in accordance with its strategies or in response to economic or other conditions 
the company s ability to pay down debt  reduce interest costs and acquire properties is dependent upon its ability to sell the properties it has selected for disposition at the prices and within the deadlines the company has established for each property 
other business risks the company may engage in future acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses  and  therefore  may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions in the time frames anticipated  or at all 
from time to time  the company may seek to grow through strategic acquisitions intended to complement or expand one or more of its business segments or to enable the company to enter a new business 
the success of these transactions will depend in part on the company s ability to integrate the systems and personnel acquired in these transactions into its existing business without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
the company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with the company s operations or in separately managing a new business 
furthermore  the company may not realize the degree of benefits that the company anticipates when first entering into a transaction  or the company may realize benefits more slowly than it anticipates 
any of these problems or delays could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s current management and internal systems may not be adequate to handle the company s growth  if any 
to manage the company s future growth  if any  the company s management must continue to improve operational and financial systems and to expand  train  retain and manage the company s employee base 
if the company grows  it will also likely need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel  and its ability to do so will depend upon a number of factors  including the company s results of operations and prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel 
at the same time  the company will likely be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other parties 
if the company s management personnel  systems  procedures and controls are inadequate to support its operations  expansion could be slowed or halted and the opportunity to gain significant additional market share could be impaired or lost 
any inability of the company s management to manage the company s growth effectively may adversely affect its results of operations 
the company s business could be seriously harmed if the company s accounting controls and procedures are circumvented or otherwise fail to achieve their intended purposes 
although the company evaluates its internal controls over financial reporting and its disclosure controls and procedures at the end of each quarter  any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system will be met 
any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s internal control systems and procedures  or any other future acquisitions and their respective internal control systems and procedures  will not result in or lead to a future material weakness in the company s internal controls  or that the company or its independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the company s internal controls in the future 
if the company s internal controls over financial reporting are not considered adequate  the company s financial statements could become incorrect or misleading and the company may experience a loss of public confidence  which could subject the company to liability and have an adverse effect on the company s business and the price of the company s common stock 
a further  deficiencies or weaknesses that are not yet identified by the company could emerge and the identification and correction of those deficiencies or weaknesses could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results can fluctuate significantly 
the company has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in its quarterly and annual operating results  which may adversely affect the company s stock price 
future quarterly and annual operating results may not align with past trends as a result of numerous factors  including many factors that result from the unpredictability of the nature and timing of real estate land sales  the variability in gross profit margins and competitive pressures 
changes in the company s income tax estimates could affect profitability 
in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate the company s income taxes 
the company s estimates are based on its interpretation of federal and state tax laws and regulations 
the company estimates actual current tax due and assesses temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period  the company will include the adjustments in the tax provision in its financial statements 
these adjustments could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
the price of the company s common stock in recent years has been volatile 
this volatility may make it difficult for shareholders to sell the company s common stock  and the sale of substantial amounts of the company s common stock could adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
the market price for the company s common stock varied between a high of and a low of per share between may  and april  this volatility may make it difficult for a shareholder to sell the company s common stock  and the sale of substantial amounts of the company s common stock could adversely affect the price of the common stock 
the company s stock price may continue to be volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations in response to market and other factors  including the other factors discussed in risk factors  and variations in the company s quarterly and annual operating results  which could be significant  material announcements by the company or the company s competitors  sales of a substantial number of shares of the company s common stock  and adverse changes in general economic or market conditions 
in addition to the factors discussed above  the company s common stock is often thinly traded  which means that large transactions in the company s common stock may be difficult to execute in a short time frame and may cause significant fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
the average trading volume in the company s common stock on the new york stock exchange over the ten day trading period ending on april  was approximately  shares per day 
further  there have been  from time to time  significant short positions in the company s common stock  consisting of borrowed shares sold  or shares sold for future delivery  which may not have been borrowed 
any attempt by the short sellers to liquidate their positions over a short period of time could cause significant volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock  many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
the company has not been involved in any securities class action litigation  however  if the company were to become involved in securities class action litigation in the future  it could result in substantial costs and diversion of the company s management s attention and resources and could harm the company s stock price  business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the broader stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years 
this volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
a the company has a significant shareholder whose interests may conflict with those of other investors 
the company has a significant shareholder  nicholas g 
karabots  who  together with certain of his affiliates  currently owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
because of his significant voting power  this shareholder  who is also a member of the company s board of directors  as a practical matter  has the ability to elect all of the members of the company s board of directors 
also  because of this voting power and his role as a director and member of the executive committee of the company s board of directors  mr 
karabots could influence the company to make decisions that might run counter to the wishes of the company s other shareholders generally 
in addition  a publishing company owned by this shareholder is also a significant customer of the company s newsstand distribution services business  as well as a customer of its subscription fulfillment services business  and  as a result  this shareholder may have business interests with respect to the company that differ from or conflict with those of other holders of the company s common stock 
although the company has paid dividends in the past  no dividends have been paid since  the company has no regular dividend policy and offers no assurance of any future dividends 
the company has paid no cash dividends on its common stock since fiscal year the board of directors has stated that it may consider special dividends from time to time in the future in light of conditions then existing  including earnings  financial condition  cash position  and capital requirements and other needs 
no assurance is given that there will be any such future dividends declared 
the company has been a controlled company within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and consequently has been exempt from certain corporate governance requirements of those rules 
on may   the company ceased to be a controlled company but in accordance with those rules will not need to fully comply with those requirements until one year thereafter 
because nicholas g 
karabots and certain of his affiliates until may   together owned more than of the voting power of the company s common stock  the company was considered a controlled company for the purposes of the rules and regulations of the new york stock exchange 
as such  the company was permitted to elect  and elected  to opt out of the new york stock exchange requirements that would otherwise require its compensation and human resources committee to consist entirely of independent directors 
as permitted by the rules  the company also opted not to have a nominating corporate governance committee which the rules require for non controlled companies 
since mr 
karabots and his affiliates no longer own more than of the voting power of the company s common stock  the company is no longer a controlled company for purposes of the rules 
the rules provide for a twelve month transition period during which the company will not need to fully comply with the otherwise applicable requirements 
during the transition period  the company is not required to have an entirely independent compensation and human resources committee and that committee now includes one member mr 
karabots  who is its chairman who is not independent 
also  although the company has now established a nominating corporate governance committee comprised entirely of independent directors  the rules similarly do not require the committee to be comprised entirely of independent directors during the transition period 
accordingly  during the transition period shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements 
certain provisions of oklahoma law and the company s organic documents may impede or discourage a takeover  which may have a limiting effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
the company is an oklahoma corporation and the anti takeover provisions of the company s amended certificate of incorporation and of oklahoma law generally prohibit the company from engaging in business combinations with an interested shareholder  as those terms are defined therein  unless the holders of at least two thirds of the company s then outstanding common stock approve the transaction 
consequently  the concurrence of the company s significant shareholder  mr 
karabots and his affiliates  is needed for any third party other than mr 
karabots and his affiliates to acquire control of the company  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the company s other shareholders 
in addition to this restriction  some other provisions of the company s amended certificate of incorporation and of its by laws may discourage certain acts involving a fundamental change of the company 
for example  the company s amended certificate of incorporation and its by laws contain certain provisions that a classify the company s board of directors into three classes  each of which serves for a term of three years  with one class being elected each year  and prohibit shareholders from calling a special meeting of shareholders 
because the company s board of directors is classified and the company s amended certificate of incorporation and by laws do not otherwise provide  section of the oklahoma general corporation act permits the removal of any member of the board of directors only for cause 
these factors could impede a merger  takeover or other business combination involving the company or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for the company s common stock  which could have a limiting effect on the market price of the company s common stock

in march  a civil action was commenced in the united states district court for the southern district of new york entitled anderson news  llc  et al 
v 
american media  inc  et al 
anderson news  llc anderson was a wholesaler of magazines 
anderson has alleged that magazine publishers and distributors  including a company subsidiary  kable distribution services  inc kable distribution  conspired to boycott anderson to drive it out of business  and that other wholesalers participated in this effort 
anderson has asserted claims under section of the sherman act antitrust  for defamation  for tortious interference with its contracts with retailers  and for civil conspiracy 
damages have not been quantified  but would presumably be alleged to be substantial 
anderson has alleged that the distributor and publisher defendants acted in concert to cut off anderson from its supply of magazines to enable them to gain control of the single copy magazine distribution channel 
kable distribution is vigorously defending the lawsuit and moved  along with the other defendants  to dismiss the action 
those motions were granted by an opinion and order dated august   by which anderson was also denied leave to replead 
anderson moved for reconsideration of the opinion and order and for permission to replead 
that motion was denied by an order dated october  anderson s attorneys filed a notice of appeal in the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
by decision dated april   the court of appeals held that anderson should have been allowed to file an amended complaint 
the defendants then petitioned the court of appeals for a rehearing of the decision and on july   the petition was denied 
unless a stay is granted  the case is now expected to proceed with anderson filing its amended complaint and kable distribution denying all allegations of wrongful conduct on its part 
the defendants are considering petitioning the united states supreme court to consider the case

kable distribution s co defendant  island periodicals puerto rico  llc  is a sub distributor of magazines for kable distribution in puerto rico  a position formerly held by plaintiff 
in the lawsuit plaintiff has alleged that the termination by kable distribution of plaintiff s former sub distributorship arrangement with kable distribution was in breach of a contract between them  and therefore in violation of puerto rico law  a statute that provides remedies to a dealer in property for the unjustified termination of its dealership arrangement 
plaintiff is seeking damages from kable distribution in the amount of  and injunctive relief

data concerning industry segments is set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the company s foreign sales and activities are not significant 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references in this item to  and mean the company s fiscal years ended april   and  unless otherwise qualified 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of those financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include i the determination of revenue recognition for the newsstand distribution services business  which is based on estimates of allowances for magazine returns to the company from wholesalers and the offsetting returns of magazines by the company to publishers for credit  ii allowances for doubtful accounts  iii real estate cost of sales calculations  which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete  iv cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets  goodwill and assets held for sale  v actuarially determined benefit obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosures  vi risk assessment of uncertain tax positions  vii the determination of the recoverability of net deferred tax assets  and viii legal contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates a that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates include the following i newsstand distribution services revenues represent commissions earned from the distribution of publications for client publishers  which are recorded by the company at the time the publications go on sale in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc the publications generally are sold on a fully returnable basis  which is in accordance with prevailing trade practice 
accordingly  the company provides for estimated returns by charges to income that are determined on an issue by issue basis utilizing historical experience and current sales information 
the financial impact to the company of a change in the sales estimate for magazine returns to it from its wholesalers is substantially offset by the simultaneous change in the company s estimate of its cost of purchases since it passes on the returns to publishers for credit 
as a result  the effect of a difference between the actual and estimated return rates on the company s commission revenues is the amount of the commission attributable to the difference 
the effect of an increase or decrease in the company s estimated rate of returns of during any period would be dependent upon the mix of magazines involved and the related selling prices and commission rates  but would generally result in a change in that period s net commission revenues of approximately  ii management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by attempting to identify troubled accounts by analyzing the credit risk of specific customers and by using historical experience applied to the aging of accounts and  where appropriate within the real estate business  by reviewing any collateral which may secure a receivable  iii real estate development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project  and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies  but not yet incurred  iv asset impairment determinations are based upon the intended use of assets  expected future cash flows and estimates of fair value of assets  v benefit obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosures are based upon numerous assumptions and estimates  including the expected rate of investment return on retirement plan assets  the discount rate used to determine the present value of liabilities  and certain employee related factors such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
as of april   the effect of every change in the investment rate of return on retirement plan assets would increase or decrease the pension expense by approximately  per year  and the effect of every change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the subsequent year s pension cost by approximately  vi the company assesses risk for uncertain tax positions and recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities  vii projected company earnings including currently unrealized gains on real estate inventory for the recoverability of net deferred tax assets in the future and viii the company is currently involved in legal proceedings which are described in item of this annual report on form k and the company estimates whether the legal proceedings relate to a probable loss and if so  then an estimate of probable loss within a range of potential probable losses is made for accrual in the financial statements 
it is possible that the consolidated financial position or results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an outcome of litigation that is significantly different from the company s assumptions 
the company does not accrue for expected future legal costs for such proceedings 
results of operations year ended april  compared to year ended april  for  the company recorded a net loss of  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  in the results for included a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of   after tax  or per share  reflecting the write down of certain real estate assets 
the results for included pre tax  non cash impairment charges of   after tax  or per share  reflecting the write down of certain real estate assets  before tax and  or per share  after tax and of all of the goodwill of the company s newsstand distribution services business  with no tax benefit  or per share 
excluding the impairment charges in both years  results for were a net loss of  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share  for revenues for were  compared to  in the prior year 
revenues from the company s media services operations decreased from  for to  for magazine publishers  which are the principal customers of these operations  have continued to be negatively impacted by increased competition from new media distribution sources and also by the effects of the recent recession and the continued weak us economy 
the result has been a trend of reduced subscription and newsstand magazine sales  which has caused publishers to close some magazine titles and seek more favorable terms from palm coast and kable and their competitors when contracts are up for bid or renewal 
as a consequence of these and other factors  including customer losses  revenues from subscription fulfillment services operations decreased from  for to  for  while revenues from newsstand distribution services operations decreased from  in to  in revenues from product services and other increased a from  in to  in  primarily due to an increase in revenues from a temporary staffing business which were partially offset by declines in revenues from the product services business 
although there are multiple revenue streams in the subscription fulfillment services business  including revenues from the maintenance of customer computer files and the performance of other fulfillment related activities  including telephone call center support and graphic arts and lettershop services  a customer generally contracts for and utilizes all available services as a total package  and the company would not normally provide ancillary services to a customer unless it is also providing the core service of maintaining a database of subscriber names 
thus  variations in subscription fulfillment services revenues are the result of fluctuations in the number and sizes of customers rather than in the demand for a particular service 
this is also true in the newsstand distribution services business where there is only one primary service provided  which results in one revenue source  the commissions earned on the distribution of magazines 
the company competes with other companies  including three larger companies in the newsstand distribution services business and one larger company in the subscription fulfillment services business  and the competition for new customers is intense in both segments  which results in a price sensitivity that makes it difficult for the company to increase its prices 
revenues from land sales at amrep southwest increased from  in to  in results for both periods were substantially lower than the company has historically experienced in its principal market of rio rancho  new mexico  due to a severe decline in the real estate market in the greater albuquerque metro and rio rancho areas that began late in fiscal the trend of declining permits for new home construction in rio rancho also continued  with fewer single family residential building permits issued during fiscal than in fiscal faced with these adverse conditions  many builders have slowed the pace of building on developed lots previously purchased from the company in rio rancho and delayed or cancelled the purchase of additional developed lots 
the steep decline in the company s sale of undeveloped land to both builders and investors also reflected these factors 
in rio rancho  the company offers for sale both developed and undeveloped lots to national  regional and local home builders  commercial and industrial property developers and others 
the company sold acres of land in  mostly undeveloped  at an average selling price of  per acre compared to acres of land in  both developed and undeveloped  at an average selling price of  per acre  reflecting differences in the mix of properties sold in each period 
the average gross profit percentage on land sales was for compared to for the sale of undeveloped land in consisted of land sold to a quasi governmental agency under threat of condemnation for its use as part of a flood plain  and the nature of the land and resulting average selling price are not believed to be representative of the company s inventory and investment properties 
as a result of these and other factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  revenues  average selling prices and related average gross profits from land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
in addition  as noted above  amrep southwest recorded impairment charges in and based on appraisals of portions of amrep southwest real estate that in each year showed a deterioration in fair market value from the prior year 
should the adverse real estate market conditions continue  amrep southwest may experience future impairment charges 
operating expenses for the company s media services businesses were  of related revenues for compared to  of related revenues for the decrease of  was primarily due to i a decrease of  related to payroll and benefits costs as a result of both reduced and lost business noted earlier and efficiencies achieved in the company s consolidation of its subscription fulfillment services business from three locations in colorado  illinois and florida into one location at palm coast  florida that was completed during the second quarter of  and ii a decrease of  related to facilities and equipment costs  including depreciation  primarily as a result of the completed consolidation project 
in june  palm coast received  pursuant to an agreement with the state of florida the award agreement as part of the incentives made available in connection with the company s project  completed in the second quarter of  to consolidate its subscription fulfillment services operations at its palm coast  florida location 
the award agreement includes certain performance requirements in terms of job retention  job creation and capital investment through december  which  if not met by palm coast  entitle the state of florida to obtain the return of a portion  or all  of the  accordingly  the  has been recorded as a liability 
the award monies  if any  to which palm coast becomes irrevocably entitled will be amortized into income over the life of the assets acquired with them 
as of april   palm coast had not met certain of the performance requirements  in large part due to the adverse economic conditions experienced by the magazine publishing industry since the award agreement was entered into 
palm coast is currently in discussions with the state of florida a regarding the project s performance data  and is unable to offer any assurance that the award monies  in whole or in part  will not have to be returned to the state of florida 
interest and other revenues decreased  for compared to  primarily due to a land lease that expired in with no similar revenue in other operating expenses increased  for compared to the prior year  primarily due to i higher real estate tax expense and ii higher land maintenance costs  both at amrep southwest 
general and administrative expenses of media services operations decreased  in compared to  primarily due to the streamlined operations and increased efficiencies resulting from the subscription fulfillment services business consolidation project 
real estate operations and corporate general and administrative expenses decreased  as costs associated with the evaluation of a going private proposal submitted to the company by its major shareholder and subsequently withdrawn together with the filing of an s registration statement did not reoccur in the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate of the tax benefit was primarily due to i a reduction of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain prior year tax benefits in both and and ii permanent items  the most significant being the charge against book income associated with non tax deductible goodwill in year ended april  compared to year ended april  for  the company recorded a net loss of  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share 
the results for included pre tax  non cash impairment charges of   after tax  or per share  reflecting the write down of certain real estate assets  before tax and  or per share  after tax and of all of the goodwill of the company s newsstand distribution services business  with no tax benefit  or per share

revenues from the company s media services operations decreased from  for to  for magazine publishers  the principal customers of these operations  continued to be impacted by the effects of the recent recession and also from increased competition from new media sources 
this resulted in reduced subscription and newsstand sales  which in turn caused certain publishers to close magazine titles or seek more favorable contract terms from palm coast and kable and their competitors 
as a consequence of these and other factors and customer losses  revenues from subscription fulfillment services operations decreased from  for to  for  primarily reflecting i customer losses and ii reduced and lost business that resulted from lower publisher customer volumes and a higher attrition of magazine titles than was previously experienced 
revenues from newsstand distribution services operations decreased from  in to  in  with the decrease due primarily to a decline in retail magazine sales through the newsstand distribution system 
revenues from product services and other businesses increased from  in to  in  primarily due to an increase in revenues from the temporary staffing business offset in part by a decrease in revenues from the specialty packaging business 
revenues from land sales at amrep southwest decreased from  in to  in results for both periods were substantially lower than the company historically experienced in its principal market of rio rancho  new mexico  due to a severe decline in the real estate market in the greater albuquerque metro and rio rancho areas that began late in fiscal the trend of declining permits for new home construction in rio rancho also continued  with fewer single family residential building permits issued during fiscal than in fiscal faced with these adverse conditions  many builders slowed the pace of building on developed lots previously purchased from the company in rio rancho and delayed or cancelled the purchase of additional developed lots

a in rio rancho  the company offers for sale both developed and undeveloped lots to national  regional and local home builders  commercial and industrial property developers and others 
the company sold acres of land in at an average selling price of  per acre compared to the sale of acres of land in at an average selling price of  reflecting differences in the mix of properties sold in each period 
the average gross profit percentage on land sales was for compared to for as a result of these and other factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  revenues and related gross profits from land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
in addition  as noted above  amrep southwest recorded impairment charges in and due to appraisals of portions of amrep southwest real estate that in each year showed a significant deterioration in fair market value from the prior year 
operating expenses for the company s media services businesses were  of related revenues for compared to  of related revenues for the decrease of  was primarily due to i a decrease of  related to payroll and benefits costs associated with the decreased revenue as well as from efficiencies achieved in the company s consolidation of its subscription fulfillment services business  which is discussed two paragraphs below  and ii a decrease of  related to facilities and equipment costs  including depreciation  primarily as a result of the closure of the colorado and illinois subscription fulfillment services locations also discussed below 
the company recognized a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of reflecting the write off of all of the goodwill of its newsstand distribution services business segment 
the primary reasons for the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge were the decrease in the company s total stock market capitalization to an amount that is less than its shareholders equity and the continued weakness of revenue trends in the newsstand distribution industry 
the current operating results and uncertain future expectations reflect the well publicized decline in the magazine publishing industry  which represents the newsstand distribution services segment s customer base  as well as the recent recession in the us economy and the uncertainty about that economy s future 
the company also considered that the securities and exchange commission interprets a decline in a company s stock market capitalization below its shareholders equity as indicating that goodwill should be tested for impairment 
as of april   the company s total market capitalization had been below its shareholders equity for approximately ten months in the goodwill impairment charge had no effect on the day to day operations of the company s newsstand distribution services business 
during the company completed a project in which it consolidated its subscription fulfillment services business operations from three locations in colorado  florida and illinois into one existing location at palm coast  florida 
this project streamlined operations and created cost efficiencies through reduced overhead costs and the elimination of operating redundancies 
through april   the company had incurred approximately  of non recurring costs and  for capital expenditures related to the consolidation project 
the state of florida and the city of palm coast agreed to provide incentives for the project  including cash and employee training grants and tax relief  which are largely contingent on job retention  job creation and capital investment 
the company incurred restructuring costs of  and  for and and recognized  and  of income for incentives and other reimbursements related to the consolidation project for the same periods 
as a result  the company reported net charges to operations of  and  related to restructuring for and which are included in restructuring and fire recovery costs in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
as of april  and  the company had accruals for future payments related to the consolidation project of  and  principally for severance and facilities consolidation 
cash payments related to the project were  and  for and there were no significant accrual reversals related to the consolidation project in any year 
the company also had charges to operations that totaled  in for costs related to a warehouse fire  principally for legal costs 
during  as a result of insurance reimbursements received  the company recorded a net gain of  related to the fire 
the items of income and expense related to insurance proceeds and the fire recovery costs are included in restructuring and fire recovery costs in the company s consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings 
interest and other revenues decreased  for compared to  primarily due to a sale in of non inventory assets which was not repeated in other operating expenses decreased  for compared to the prior year  primarily due to lower real estate tax expense resulting from the favorable settlement of a property tax appeal by amrep southwest 
a general and administrative expenses of media services operations decreased  in compared to  primarily due to the streamlined operations and increased efficiencies resulting from the subscription fulfillment services business consolidation project 
real estate operations and corporate general and administrative expenses increased  as costs associated with the evaluation of a going private proposal submitted to the company by a major shareholder and subsequently withdrawn together with the filing of an s registration statement were partially offset by a reduction in payroll and benefits resulting from reduced personnel 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate of the tax benefit was primarily due to i permanent items  the most significant being the charge against book income associated with non tax deductible goodwill in  and ii a reduction of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain prior year tax benefits in both and liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funding for working capital requirements are cash flow from operations and banking facilities 
the company s liquidity is affected by many factors  including some that are based on normal operations and some that are related to the industries in which the company operates and the economy generally 
the company s media services businesses finance their operations in part through a revolving credit facility defined below as the media services credit facility that matures may  the company s media services businesses also rely on cash flow from operations and operate with negative working capital  primarily as a result of liquidity provided by one material customer contract that expires june amrep southwest finances its business from cash flow from operations  which has been minimal in and due to the poor conditions in its real estate markets  and from advances made to it by its parent 
it also has a loan agreement defined below as the asw credit facility that matures september  under which it may not borrow any additional funds 
amrep southwest has initiated discussions with the bank regarding the extension of this arrangement  but there can be no assurance that this facility can be extended on acceptable terms 
if amrep southwest is unable to extend this facility  it would not have sufficient funds to satisfy its obligation to the bank  and the company would be forced to seek either replacement financing or other sources of capital  such as by selling assets or issuing equity  which replacement financing or other sources of capital might not be available on acceptable terms 
it is likely that the expiration without renewal or extension or the termination of either of the credit facilities or the customer contract described above would have a material adverse effect on the company 
due to the closing of certain facilities in connection with the consolidation of the company s subscription fulfillment services business and the associated work force reduction  the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  and the regulations thereunder have accorded to the pension benefit guaranty corporation the pbgc the right to require the company to accelerate the funding of approximately  of accrued pension related obligations to the company s defined benefit pension plan plan 
the company and the pbgc have reached an agreement in principle to deal with the funding obligation which provides for the company to make a  cash contribution to the plan  which is to be made within ten days after a formal agreement is signed 
if  before the expiration of one year  the company is unable to pay the remaining liability or adequately secure it with collateral acceptable to the pbgc  the company will be required to i provide a letter of credit equal to of the remaining liability or establish a cash escrow for of the remaining liability  or ii discharge the remaining liability in quarterly installments over a five year period with security acceptable to the pbgc 
in the event the company fails to meet the terms of the agreement  the pbgc could seek immediate payment of the amount due or attempt to force a termination of the plan 
the company is unable to offer any assurance that it will be able to discharge the plan funding obligation within one year or meet the pbgc s requirements for securing or paying the undischarged amount  nor can it offer any assurance that upon such inability it will be able to negotiate with the pbgc to obtain further relief

this guidance includes amendments that clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements  in addition to other amendments that change principles or requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
this new accounting guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments require that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating which presentation option it will utilize for comprehensive income in its consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance will not impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows and will only impact the presentation of other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
segment information information by industry segment is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report on form k 
industry segment information is prepared in a manner consistent with the manner in which financial information is prepared and evaluated by management for making operating decisions 
a number of assumptions and estimates are required to be made in the determination of segment data  including the need to make certain allocations of common costs and expenses among segments 
on an annual basis  management evaluates the basis upon which costs are allocated  and has periodically made revisions to these methods of allocation

impact of inflation operations of the company can be impacted by inflation 
within the industries in which the company operates  inflation can cause increases in the cost of materials  services  interest and labor 
unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies  operating margins will decrease 
within the land development industry  the company encounters particular risks 
a large part of the company s real estate sales are to homebuilders who face their own inflationary concerns that rising housing costs  including interest costs  may substantially outpace increases in the incomes of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to purchase a new home or sell an owned home 
if this situation were to exist  the demand for the company s land by these homebuilder customers could decrease 
in general  in recent years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s markets  and as a result the company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in any of its businesses
