item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes set forth under item financial statements and supplementary data 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat serious diseases associated with inflammation 
we currently have one phase clinical program  blisibimod 
two of our product candidates  varespladib and varespladib sodium  are designed to inhibit a novel enzyme target known as secretory phospholipase a  or spla elevated levels of spla have been implicated in a variety of acute inflammatory conditions  including acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome associated with sickle cell disease  as well as in chronic diseases  including stable coronary artery disease 
in addition  our phase product candidate  blisibimod  targets elevated levels of b cell activating factor  or baff  which has been associated with a variety of b cell mediated autoimmune diseases  including systemic lupus erythematosus  or lupus  lupus nephritis vasculitis  rheumatoid arthritis  multiple sclerosis  sj gren s syndrome  graves disease and others 
on march   an independent data safety monitoring board dsmb recommended stopping the company s vista clinical study for varespladib 
after review of the totality of evidence  including the emerging unblinded data from vista  the dsmb was unanimous in its view that there was cogent evidence to recommend early termination of the trial 
according to the dsmb  the chief reason is the inability of vista to detect a statistically significant benefit of the drug on the prespecified primary and secondary endpoints even if the trial continues to its scheduled termination 
we believe that the dsmb s decision was based on the belief that the risk profile of the drug would not outweigh any benefit 
as a result  we have closed enrollment in the study and informed all investigators to remove patients from therapy immediately 
we have also closed enrollment in our impacts clinical study for varespladib sodium 
while data continues to be made available to us  and while we continue to assess these data  based on the dsmb recommendation we expect that we will not engage in any further development activities of our spla portfolio 
we were incorporated and commenced operations in september since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in january  anthera pharmaceuticals  limited  a wholly owned subsidiary  was incorporated in ireland 
the establishment of this subsidiary was part of the company s ongoing growth activities and strategic plan 
as of the date of this filing  we have never generated any revenue and have generated only interest income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years as we pursue the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
to date  we have funded our operations through equity offerings  private placements of convertible debt and debt financings  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
we will need substantial additional financing to continue to develop our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals and to fund operating expenses  which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing 
we cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition to the normal 
table of contents risks associated with development stage companies  we may never successfully complete development of any of our product candidates  obtain adequate patent protection for our technology  obtain necessary government regulatory approval for our product candidates or achieve commercial viability for any approved product candidates 
in addition  we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates 
revenue to date  we have not generated any revenue 
we do not expect to generate revenue unless or until we obtain regulatory approval of  and commercialize  our product candidates or in license additional products that generate revenue 
we intend to seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales  up front fees and milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships and royalties resulting from the licensing of the commercial rights to our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the nature  timing and amount of milestone payments we may receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized  as well as any revenue we may receive from our collaborative or strategic relationships 
research and development expenses since our inception  we have focused our activities on our product candidate development programs 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses consist of personnel costs  including salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  clinical studies performed by contract research organizations  or cros  materials and supplies  licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs 
research and development activities are also separated into three main categories licensing  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
licensing costs consist primarily of fees paid pursuant to license agreements 
historically  our clinical development costs have included costs for preclinical and clinical studies 
we expect to incur substantial clinical development costs for our phase b clinical study named pearl sc for blisibimod  as well as for the development of our other product candidates 
pharmaceutical development costs consist of expenses incurred relating to clinical studies and product formulation and manufacturing 
we expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
we are developing our product candidates in parallel  and we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects 
thus  some of our research and development costs are not attributable to an individually named project  but rather are allocated across our clinical stage programs 
these unallocated costs include salaries  stock based compensation charges and related fringe benefit costs for our employees such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums  consulting fees and travel 

table of contents the following table shows our total research and development expenses for the years ended december    and  and for the period from september  date of inception through december  in thousands for the period september  date of inception to december  years ended december  allocated costs varespladib blisibimod varespladib sodium unallocated costs total development includes milestone payments of million pursuant to amendments to the license agreements with each of eli lilly and shionogi co 
ltd  which were paid in the form of shares of common stock 
includes license fees of million pursuant to a license agreement with each of eli lilly and shionogi co 
ltd  which were paid in cash and shares of preferred stock in includes a one time license initiation fee of million pursuant to a license agreement with amgen 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop our product candidates 
we completed enrollment in the pearl sc study of blisibimod in october we intend to fund our clinical studies with existing cash and proceeds from potential future debt and equity offerings 
we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical development programs 
these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
as we obtain results from clinical studies  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical studies for certain product candidates or programs in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or programs 
completion of clinical studies may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the cost of clinical studies may vary significantly over the life of a program as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including the number of sites included in the studies  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  the number of patients that participate in the studies  the number of doses that patients receive  the drop out or discontinuation rates of patients  and the duration of patient follow up 
our expenses related to clinical studies are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to 
table of contents negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical study milestones 
expenses related to clinical studies generally are accrued based on contracted amounts and the achievement of milestones such as number of patients enrolled 
if timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes to the clinical study design or scope of work to be performed  we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis 
none of our product candidates have received us food and drug administration  or fda  or foreign regulatory marketing approval 
in order to grant marketing approval  the fda or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and that the manufacturing facilities  processes and controls are adequate 
despite our efforts  our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing  comparable drugs  be proven safe and effective in clinical studies  or meet applicable regulatory standards 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate  if ever 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions  including clinical  chemical manufacturing  regulatory  finance and business development 
other significant costs include professional fees for legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents 
we will continue to incur significant general and administrative expenses as a public company  including costs for insurance  costs related to the hiring of additional personnel  payment to outside consultants  lawyers and accountants and complying with the corporate governance  internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the accompanying notes to the financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
accrued clinical expenses we make estimates of our accrued clinical expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us at least monthly in arrears for services performed 
we 
table of contents periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include fees paid to cros in connection with clinical studies  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical studies  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical study materials  and fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities 
we base our accruals related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and cros that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical study milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we adjust the accrual accordingly 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation compensation costs related to all equity instruments  excluding restricted stock units rsus  are recognized at the grant date fair value of the awards 
rsus are accounted for as a liability award  and as such the fair value of the awards are remeasured at each reporting date 
additionally  we are required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited in calculating compensation costs  which are recognized over the requisite service period of the awards on a straight line basis 
we account for stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant 
black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility  expected term  and forfeiture rate 
any changes in these highly subjective assumptions could significantly impact stock based compensation expense

thereafter  the loan will be repaid in equal monthly installments of approximately million  at the initial interest rate 
the company will also be obligated to pay an end of the term charge of million  which is being expensed over the term of the loan agreement using the effective interest rate 
the following table summarizes our estimated scheduled future minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year years total notes payable interest on notes payable facility lease equipment lease total interest payments reflected are estimated based on an interest rate of throughout the term of the note  plus an additional end of term charge of the above amounts exclude potential payments to be made under our license agreements to our licensors that are based on the progress of our product candidates in development  as these payments are not determinable 
under our license agreement with eli lilly and shionogi co  ltd 
to develop and commercialize certain spla inhibitors  we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development  regulatory  and commercial objectives 
we are also obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved as defined by this collaboration 
our obligation to pay royalties with respect to each licensed product in each country will expire upon the later of a years following the date of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country  and b the first date on which generic version s of the applicable licensed product achieve a total market share  in the aggregate  of or more of the total unit sales of wholesalers to pharmacies of licensed product and all generic versions combined in the applicable country 
also excluded from the table above are potential milestone payments on the development of blisibimod 
under our license agreement with amgen to develop and commercialize blisibimod  we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development  regulatory and commercial objectives

funding requirements we expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses as we continue to advance our product candidates into preclinical studies and clinical studies and as we continue clinical development of blisibimod  hire additional clinical  scientific and management personnel  and implement new operational  financial and management information systems 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include the following the progress of preclinical development and clinical studies of our product candidates  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by evolving requirements of regulatory agencies  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  our ability to establish  enforce and maintain selected strategic alliances  and the acquisition of technologies  product candidates and other business opportunities that require financial commitments 
to date  we have not generated any revenue 
we do not expect to generate commercial product revenue unless or until we obtain regulatory approval of  and commercialize  our product candidates 
we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in cash used in operations over the next several years 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including the progress and results of our clinical studies  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  our revenue  if any  from successful development and commercialization of our product candidates  the costs of commercialization activities  the scope  progress  results and costs of preclinical development  laboratory testing and clinical studies for other product candidates  the emergence of competing therapies and other market developments  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property rights  the extent to which we acquire or invest in other product candidates and technologies  and our ability to establish collaborations and obtain milestone  royalty or other payments from any collaborators 
as of the date of this report  we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will enable us to meet our obligations and sustain our operations through at least the next months 
however  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect to conduct additional or extended clinical studies and seek regulatory approval of our product candidates 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling debt securities  if convertible  further dilution to 
table of contents our existing stockholders may result 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  collaboration agreements  debt financings or licensing arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to terminate  significantly modify or delay our development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates  market prices  and foreign currency exchange rates 
however  since a majority of our investments are in short term certificates of deposit  fdic insured corporate bonds and money market funds  we do not believe we are subject to any material market risk exposure 
as of december   we did not have any material derivative financial instruments 
the fair value of our marketable securities  including those included in cash equivalents and short term investments  was million as of december  our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities 
we actively review  along with our investment advisors  current investment ratings  company specific events and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other than temporary 
we will monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional other than temporary impairment charges
