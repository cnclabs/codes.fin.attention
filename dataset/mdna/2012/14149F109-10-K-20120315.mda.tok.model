in addition  our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results 
in addition  this section should be read in conjunction with the description of our risk factors in item a above 
overview we are a financial holding company formed in and headquartered in fairfax county  virginia 
we were formed principally in response to opportunities resulting from the consolidation of several virginia based banks 
these bank consolidations were typically accompanied by the dissolution of local boards of directors and relocation or termination of management and customer service professionals and a general deterioration of personalized customer service 
we own cardinal bank the bank  a virginia state chartered community bank with banking offices located in northern virginia and the greater washington  dc metropolitan area 
the bank offers a wide range of traditional bank loan and deposit products and services to both our commercial and retail customers 
our commercial relationship managers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses as well as government contractors  commercial real estate developers and builders and professionals  such as physicians  accountants and attorneys 
additionally  we complement our core banking operations by offering a wide range of services through our various subsidiaries  including mortgage banking through george mason mortgage  llc george mason and cardinal first mortgage  llc cardinal first  collectively the mortgage 
table of contents banking segment  and retail securities brokerage though cardinal wealth services  inc cws  asset management through wilson bennett capital management  inc wilson bennett  and trust  estate  custody  investment management and retirement planning through the trust division of cardinal bank  collectively the wealth management and trust services segment 
george mason  based in fairfax  virginia  engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis through fifteen branches located throughout the metropolitan washington region 
george mason does business in eight states  primarily virginia and maryland  and the district of columbia 
george mason is one of the largest residential mortgage originators in the greater washington  dc metropolitan area  generating originations of approximately billion and billion of loans in and  respectively  excluding advances on construction loans and including loans purchased from other mortgage banking companies which are owned by local home builders but managed by george mason the managed companies 
george mason s primary sources of revenue include loan origination fees  net interest income earned on loans held for sale  gains on sales of loans and contractual management fees earned relating to services provided to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders 
at the time we enter into an interest rate lock arrangement with the borrower  we enter into a loan forward sale commitment with a third party 
our mortgage loans are then sold servicing released 
cardinal first offers a construction to permanent loan program 
this program provides variable rate financing for customers to construct their residences 
once the home has been completed  the loan converts to fixed rate financing and is sold into the secondary market 
these construction to permanent loans generate fee income as well as net interest income for cardinal first and are classified as loans held for sale 
the mortgage banking segment s business is both cyclical and seasonal 
the cyclical nature of its business is influenced by  among other factors  the levels of and trends in mortgage interest rates  national and local economic conditions and consumer confidence in the economy 
historically  the mortgage banking segment has its lowest levels of quarterly loan closings during the first quarter of the year 
wilson bennett provides asset management services to certain of our customers 
wilson bennett uses a value oriented approach that focuses on large capitalization stocks 
wilson bennett s primary source of revenue is management fees earned on the assets it manages for its customers 
these management fees are generally based upon the market value of managed and custodial assets and  accordingly  revenues from wilson bennett will be  assuming a consistent customer base  more when appropriate indices  such as the s p  are higher and lower when such indices are depressed 
we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  cardinal statutory trust i  for the purpose of issuing million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures trust preferred securities 
these trust preferred securities are due in and pay interest at a rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus  which adjusts quarterly 
these securities are redeemable at par 
the interest rate on this debt was at december  we have guaranteed payment of these securities 
the million payable by us to cardinal statutory trust i is included in other borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of condition since cardinal statutory trust i is an unconsolidated subsidiary as we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity 
we utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities to make a capital contribution into the bank 
net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
we define revenue as net interest income plus non interest income 
as discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section  we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize  and concurrently stabilize  net interest income 
we do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  but are unable to eliminate it entirely 
in addition to 
table of contents managing interest rate risk  we also analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk 
loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry  and we attempt to limit our exposure to these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit 
in addition to net interest income  noninterest income is an important source of revenue for us and includes  among other things  service charges on deposits and loans  investment fee income  which includes trust revenues  gains and losses on sales of investment securities available for sale  gains on sales of mortgage loans  and management fee income 
net interest income and non interest income represented the following percentages of total revenue  which is calculated as net interest income plus non interest income  for the three years ended december  net interest income non interest income non interest income was a larger percentage of our total revenue for than in because of the increase in realized and unrealized gains from mortgage banking activities 
during  we strategically increased the number of loan originators and mortgage banking offices to increase the revenues from the business line 
non interest income was a lower percentage of our total revenue in than in as a result of the increase in our net interest income 
during  we managed our balance sheet growth and strategically decreased the interest rates we paid on our deposit liabilities in order improve our net interest margin 
economic environment the banking environment and the markets in which we conduct our businesses will continue to be strongly influenced by developments in the us and global economies  as well as the continued implementation of rulemaking from recent financial reforms 
the global economy continued to recover modestly during the us economy expanded only modestly during  as a promising beginning with an improving labor market gave way to a slowdown in domestic demand early in the year 
by mid year  the labor market softened  followed by a sharp reversal in the stock market and in consumer sentiment 
increasing oil prices along with financial market anxiety due to the european sovereign debt crisis and difficult us budget negotiations related to the federal debt ceiling  contributed to the weakness 
domestic demand increased in the second half of  which eased us recessionary fears 
during the fourth quarter of  the stock market rebounded  consumer confidence edged up and labor markets began to show signs of improvement 
the unemployment rate at december  was down from at the end of year over year inflation drifted higher over the first three quarters of  partially as result of increased energy costs  before edging lower in the fourth quarter 
bond yields fell during the third quarter as a result of the european sovereign debt crisis  the us debt ceiling debate and fears of recession 
despite this  and a downgrade by standard poor s rating service  the demand for us government securities increased 
the federal reserve completed its second round of quantitative easing mid year 
responding to sharp declines in the equity markets  low consumer expectations and recessionary concerns  the federal reserve adopted another financial support program in september aimed at lower bond yields 
as a result  bond yields held near all time post great depression lows at the end of this low interest rate environment spurred a huge refinancing boom during the summer of  which contributed to our increased level of revenues from our mortgage banking segment 

table of contents although economic conditions remain unsettled  the metropolitan washington  dc area  the region we operate in  continues to perform relatively well  compared to other regions 
the unemployment rate in the washington  dc metropolitan area did not increase to the same level as the national unemployment rate  and commercial and residential real estate values held up well compared to other regions 
however  as the federal government has announced spending cuts  which is a principal economic driver in our region  we expect growth in the local economy to be slower than that of the us the full extent of federal budget cuts will most likely be felt after the presidential election 
our credit quality continues to remain strong despite the challenging economic environment 
at december   we had non accrual loans totaling million and loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest and still accruing of  annualized net charge offs were of our average loans receivable for the year ended december  due to continued low mortgage loan rates  originations from our mortgage banking segment for surpassed originations for as a result  net income from our mortgage banking segment increased to million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  market illiquidity and concerns over credit risk continue to impact the ratings of our pooled trust preferred securities 
we hold investments of million in par value of pooled trust preferred securities  which are significantly below book value as of december  due to the lack of liquidity in the market  deferrals and defaults of issuers  and continued investor apprehension for investing in these types of investments 
we expect challenging economic and operating conditions and an evolving regulatory regime to continue for the foreseeable future 
these conditions could continue to affect the markets in which we do business and could adversely impact our results for the degree of the impact is dependent upon the duration and severity of the aforementioned conditions and the nature of new banking regulations 
while our loan growth has continued to be strong  continued uncertainty and sluggish economic growth could adversely affect our loan portfolio  including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which would adversely impact our charge offs and provision for loan losses 
deterioration in real estate values and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses for us 
also  in the ordinary course of business  we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry  counterparty  borrower or issuer 
a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of  or default by  any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses  perhaps materially 
the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities and industries also may not function as we have anticipated 
liquidity is essential to our business 
the primary sources of funding for our bank include customer deposits and wholesale funding 
our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash  including deposits 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as general market disruption  negative views about the financial services industry generally  or an operational problem that affects a third party or us 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events 
while we believe we have a healthy liquidity position  any of the above factors could materially impact our liquidity position in the future 
the us government continues to enact legislation and develop various programs and initiatives designed to stabilize the financial services industry  stabilize the housing markets and stimulate the economy 
the banking industry is awaiting many of the regulations resulting from the implementation 
table of contents of the financial reform act 
we remain unsure of the full impact this legislation will have on our business  operations or our financial condition 
critical accounting policies general us generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting  and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions  judgments  and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such judgments  assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
actual results  in fact  could differ from initial estimates 
the accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the fair value measurements of certain assets and liabilities  accounting for economic hedging activities  accounting for impairment testing of goodwill  accounting for the impairment of amortizing intangible assets and other long lived assets  and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
allowance for loan losses we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management s best estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers 
unusual and infrequently occurring events  such as weather related disasters  may impact our assessment of possible credit losses 
as a part of our analysis  we use comparative peer group data and qualitative factors such as levels of and trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans  national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of loans exhibiting similar risk profiles to support our estimates 
for purposes of our analysis  we categorize our loans into one of five categories commercial and industrial  commercial real estate including construction  home equity lines of credit  residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
in the absence of meaningful historical loss factors  peer group loss factors are applied and are adjusted by the qualitative factors mentioned above 
the indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied for each of the five categories of loans 
in addition  we individually assign loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes  as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent 
since we have relatively limited historical loss data on which to base loss factors for classified loans  we typically apply  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  a loss factor to loans classified as special mention  a loss factor to loans classified as substandard and a loss factor to loans classified as doubtful 
loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged off 
in certain instances  we evaluate the impairment of certain loans on a loan by loan basis 
for these loans  we analyze the fair value of the collateral underlying the loan and consider estimated costs to sell the collateral on a discounted basis 
if the net collateral value is less than the loan balance including accrued interest and any unamortized premium or discount associated with the loan we recognize an impairment and establish a specific reserve for the impaired loan 
credit losses are an inherent part of our business and  although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are appropriate  it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment 
additional 
table of contents provisions for such losses  if necessary  would be recorded in the commercial banking or mortgage banking segments  as appropriate  and would negatively impact earnings 
fair value measurements we determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy  which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
our investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value using reliable and unbiased evaluations by an industry wide valuation service 
this service uses evaluated pricing models that vary based on asset class and include available trade  bid  and other market information 
generally  the methodology includes broker quotes  proprietary models  vast descriptive terms and conditions databases  as well as extensive quality control programs 
for certain of our held to maturity investment securities where there is minimal observable trading activity  we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate fair value based on internal calculations and compare our results to information provided by external pricing sources 
our interest rate swap derivatives are recorded at fair value using observable inputs from a national valuation service 
these inputs are applied to a third party industry wide valuation model 
we also fair value our interest rate lock commitments and forwards loan sales commitments 
the fair value of our interest rate lock commitments considers the expected premium discount to par and we apply certain fallout rates for those rate lock commitments for which we do not close a mortgage loan 
in addition  we calculate the effects of the changes in interest rates from the date of the commitment through loan origination  and then period end  using applicable published mortgage backed investment security prices 
the fair value of the forward sales contracts to investors considers the market price movement of the same type of security between the trade date and the balance sheet date 
at loan closing  the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is included in the cost basis of loans held for sale  which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
accounting for hedging activities we record all derivative instruments on the statement of condition at their fair values 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
for derivatives designated as hedges  we contemporaneously document the hedging relationship  including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  how effectiveness will be assessed at inception and at each reporting period and the method for measuring ineffectiveness 
we evaluate the effectiveness of these transactions at inception and on an ongoing basis 
ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income  except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the fair value adjustments for both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are recorded through the income statement with any difference considered the ineffective portion of the hedge 
we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective 
in situations in which cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued  we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the statement of condition and recognize any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings over the term of the forecasted transaction 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  we recognize immediately in earnings any gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments  including rate lock commitments  to finance residential mortgage loans 
these commitments  which contain fixed expiration dates  offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines 
table of contents and closes within the timeframe established by us 
interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor 
loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and are marked to market through earnings 
to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments  we economically hedge our commitments by entering into best efforts delivery forward loan sales contracts 
during the rate lock commitment period  these forward loan sales contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges 
exclusive of the fair value elements of the rate lock commitment related to servicing and the wholesale and retail rate spread  the changes in fair value related to movements in market rates of the rate lock commitments and the forward loan sales contracts generally move in opposite directions  and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential 
at the closing of the loan  the loan commitment derivative expires and we record a loan held for sale and continue to be obligated under the same forward loan sales contract 
the forward sales contract is then designated as a hedge against the variability in cash to be received from the loan sale 
loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value 
accounting for impairment testing of goodwill during the third quarter of  the financial accounting standards board  fasb  issued accounting standards update asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
this asu permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it need not perform the two step impairment test 
this asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
we elected to early adopt this standard as of september  we perform our annual review of the goodwill related to our mortgage banking segment during the third quarter 
after evaluating all relevant facts and circumstances  we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the mortgage banking reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and no goodwill impairment is indicated 
in the event we are required to perform a step fair value evaluation of the reporting unit  we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit 
this discounted cash flow analysis involves the use of unobservable inputs including estimated future cash flows from operations  an estimate of a terminal value  a discount rate  and other inputs 
our estimated future cash flows are largely based on our historical actual cash flows 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
accounting for the impairment of amortizing intangible assets and other long lived assets we continually review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
we evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated future cash flows  before interest expense and on an undiscounted basis  with the net book value of long term assets  including amortizable intangible assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 

table of contents an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair values 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a provision for income tax expense based on the amounts of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods 
when substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset  the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance 
the amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered 
increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes 
new financial accounting standards in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 receivables topic a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring 
this amendment clarifies the guidance on the evaluation made by a creditor on whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring 
it clarifies the guidance related to a creditor s evaluation of whether it has granted a concession to a debtor and also clarifies the guidance on a creditor s evaluation of whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
the amendment is effective for public entities for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after june   and was applied retrospectively to the beginning of the annual period of adoption 
the related disclosure requirements were also effective for interim and annual period beginning on or after june  we have adopted this guidance for purposes of evaluating our modifications as troubled debt restructurings 
the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this asu was issued concurrently with ifrs  fair value measurements  to provide largely identical guidance about fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the new standards do not extend the use of fair value but  rather  provide guidance about how fair value should be applied where it already is required or permitted under ifrs or us gaap 
for us gaap  most of the changes are clarifications of existing guidance or wording changes to align with ifrs a public entity is required to apply the asu prospectively for interim and annual periods after december  early adoption is not permitted for a public entity 
in the period of adoption  a reporting entity will be required to disclose a change  if any  in valuation technique and related inputs that result from applying the asu and to quantify the total effect  if practical 
the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the fasb issue asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this asu increases the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements 
under this asu  an entity will have the option to present the components of net income and comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements 
the asu eliminates the option in us gaap to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity 
an entity should apply the asu retrospectively  and is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we currently prepare a separate statement of comprehensive income  and therefore  have early adopted this standard as permitted 
during the third quarter of  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
this asu permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill 
table of contents impairment test 
if an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it need not perform the two step impairment test 
this asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
we elected to early adopt this standard as of september  as disclosed above under critical accounting policies

the return on average assets for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the return on average equity for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
our results of operations for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by two noncash impairment charges 
historically  we had three reporting units with associated goodwill wilson bennett  the trust division and george mason mortgage 
over time  the people and processes 
table of contents associated with the wilson bennett and trust division reporting units were assimilated to the point where the same group of employees were performing services for both subsidiaries  the subsidiaries had common customers clients  and  strategic and resource allocation decisions contemplated for the reporting units as if they were combined 
our annual assessment period for the goodwill associated with our wilson bennett reporting unit was the second calendar quarter 
commencing on july   we made the decision to combine the wilson bennett and trust division reporting units 
we performed the annual wilson bennett goodwill recoverability assessment in the second quarter and prior to the combination of the reporting units  and recognized an impairment loss of  during the fourth quarter of  we were notified by a large trust customer that it would solicit bids from other trust services providers 
we were also notified that an institutional wealth management customer was also closing its account 
because of the uncertainty surrounding these events  we performed an updated analysis of the recoverability of the goodwill and intangible assets associated with this now combined reporting unit 
while we were successful in retaining the large trust client  the projected reduction in net cash flows indicated that the goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired resulting in the write off of approximately million in goodwill and  in unamortized intangible assets 
no goodwill or intangible assets remain on the balance sheet associated with this reporting unit as of december  efficiency ratio the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue 
it represents noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income and noninterest income 
the lower the percentage  the more efficient we are operating 
we believe use of the efficiency ratio  which is a non gaap financial measure  provides additional clarity in assessing our operating results 
see table below for the components of our calculation of our efficiency ratio as of december   and our efficiency ratio has decreased over the last several years as our net interest margin has increased 
this has caused an increase in net interest income and a decrease in our efficiency ratio 
table efficiency ratio calculation years ended december    and in thousands  except per share data calculation of efficiency ratio net interest income non interest income total net interest income and non interest income for efficiency ratio non interest expense efficiency ratio efficiency ratio is calculated as total non interest expense divided by the total of net interest income and non interest income  statements of operations net interest income margin net interest income is our primary source of revenue  representing the difference between interest and fees earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
the level of net interest income is affected primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as changes in interest rates 
interest rates have remained at historical lows for the last several years as the federal reserve has had an extremely accommodative policy 
we expect this low interest rate environment to continue through see interest rate sensitivity for further information

table of contents compared to net interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in net interest income was primarily a result of our continuing to strategically decrease rates on our deposit products and other borrowed funds during compared with  in addition to increases in our interest earning assets during during  we extinguished million in fhlb advances which had an average cost of  or million annually 
as part of the prepayment arrangement with the fhlb  we paid a one time penalty of million related to these advances 
we replaced these advances with lower cost longer term funding from the fhlb 
this expense is reported in the non interest expense section of our consolidated statements of income and no such expense occurred during or our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  for the years ended december  and was and  respectively  the increase for which was primarily a result of our ability to decrease interest rates on deposits faster as we managed our balance sheet in order to maintain our yields on our interest earning assets 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  is a financial measure that we believe provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes 
to derive our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense 
for purposes of this calculation  we use our federal statutory tax rates for the periods presented 
this measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources

our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk 
management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain 
we manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee alco 
alco is responsible for managing our interest rate risk in conjunction with liquidity and capital management 

table of contents we employ an independent consulting firm to model our interest rate sensitivity 
we use a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity 
many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as interest checking  money market checking  savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit 
based on inputs that include the current balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged 
this is considered the base case 
next  the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
the down basis point scenario was discontinued given the current level of interest rates 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually moved up basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   our asset liability position was neutral based on our interest rate sensitivity model 
our net interest income would decrease by less than in a down basis point scenario and would increase by less than in an up basis point scenario over a one year time frame 
in the two year time horizon  our net interest income would decrease by less than in a down basis point scenario and would increase by less than in an up basis point scenario 
provision expense and allowance for loan losses our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents our best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers 
the provision for loan losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million compared to million at december  our allowance for loan loss ratio as a percent of total loans at december  was compared to at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan loss ratio is a direct result of a decrease in our watch list credits  recoveries recorded during  and favorable adjustments to the expected loss factors and other inputs we use to calculate our loan loss reserves as described above in critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
while we continue to report strong credit quality in our loan portfolio  we have experienced increases in our nonperforming assets as compared to historical periods and a modest increase in net charge offs as we work out our problem credits 
the increase in nonperforming assets is primarily due to a couple of relationships that are experiencing financial difficulty 
we have been monitoring these credits for several years  however  the financial conditions of these borrowers have not improved and we have therefore taken aggressive action to resolve these credit issues 
we recorded net loan charge offs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

table of contents december  non accrual loans totaled million at december  compared to million at december  a sluggish job market and declining home values could adversely affect our home equity lines of credit  credit card and other loan portfolios  including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which could impact our charge offs and provision for loan losses 
deterioration in commercial and residential real estate values  employment data and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio 
also  in the ordinary course of business  we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry  counterparty  borrower or issuer 
at december   our commercial real estate portfolio including construction lending portfolio was of our total loan portfolio 
a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of  or default by  any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses  perhaps materially  and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level or our credit exposure to individual entities and industries  may not function as we have anticipated 
the provision for loan losses was million for net charge offs for the year ended december  was million

non interest income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in non interest income for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  is primarily the result of an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities and management fee income from our mortgage banking segment 
realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities is directly related to the substantial increase in loan origination and sales volume occurring in the mortgage banking segment during as compared to  as mortgage rates declined to historic lows 
included in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities are any origination  underwriting  and discount points and other funding fees and gains associated with our sales of loans to third party investors 
direct costs associated with the loan origination  such as commissions and salaries  are recorded as a reduction to realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities 
we continue to invest resources in our mortgage business and have added over loan origination officers over the past twelve months to help increase our market share

the increase in non interest income for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  is primarily the result of an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities and management fee income from our mortgage banking segment 
realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities is directly related to an increase in loan origination and sales volume occurring in the mortgage banking segment as a result of decreased in mortgage rates and more affordable home prices during in addition  we have added mortgage loan originators during to help increase our market share 
management fee income increased million to million during as compared to million in  again due to the origination volumes in the residential real estate market 
another contributing factor to the increase in our non interest income during was an increase in investment fee income  which increased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in the market values of managed and custodial assets and an increase in customer relationships in the wealth management and trust services segment have contributed to the increase in investment fee income during

investment securities our investment securities portfolio is used as a source of income and liquidity 
the investment portfolio consists of investment securities available for sale  investment securities held to maturity and trading securities 
investment securities available for sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time  but not necessarily until maturity 
these securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset liability strategy  liquidity management or regulatory capital management 
investment securities held to maturity are those securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
investment securities trading are securities we purchase to economically hedge against fair value changes of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability 
these securities include cash equivalents  equities and mutual funds 
investment securities were million at december   a decrease of million or  from million in investment securities at december  at december   the yield on the available for sale investment portfolio was and the yield on the held to maturity portfolio was 
we complete reviews for other than temporary impairment at least quarterly 
as of december   the majority of the investment securities portfolio consisted of securities rated aaa by a leading rating agency 
investment securities which carry a aaa rating are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of investment risk 
at december   of our mortgage backed securities are guaranteed by the federal national mortgage association fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and the government national mortgage association gnma 
we have million in non government non agency mortgage backed securities 
these securities are rated from aaa to aa 
the various protective elements on the non agency securities may change in the future if market conditions or the financial stability of credit insurers changes  which could impact the ratings of these securities 

table of contents at december   certain of our investment grade securities were in a nominal unrealized loss position 
investment securities with unrealized losses are a result of pricing changes in the current market environment and not as a result of permanent credit impairment 
contractual cash flows for the agency mortgage backed securities are guaranteed and or funded by the us government 
other mortgage backed securities and municipal securities have third party protective elements and there are no negative indications that the contractual cash flows will not be received when due 
we do not intend to sell nor do we believe we will be required to sell any of our temporarily impaired securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost 
the held to maturity portfolio includes investments in four pooled trust preferred securities  totaling million of par value at december  each security has a par value of million 
the collateral underlying these structured securities are instruments issued by financial institutions or insurers 
we own the a tranches in each issuance 
each of the bonds is rated by more than one rating agency 
one security has a composite rating of a  one security has a composite rating of a  one security has a composite rating of bb  and the other security has a composite rating of b 
observable trading activity remains limited for these types of securities 
we have estimated the fair value of the securities through the use of internal calculations and through information provided by external pricing services 
given the level of subordination below the a tranches  and the actual and expected performance of the underlying collateral  we expect to receive all contractual interest and principal payments recovering the amortized cost basis of each of the four securities  and concluded that these securities are not other than temporarily impaired 
we continuously monitor the financial condition of the underlying issues and the level of subordination below the a tranches 
we also utilize a multi scenario model which assumes varying levels of additional defaults and deferrals and the effects of such adverse developments on the contractual cash flows for the a tranches

at december   we had brokered certificates of deposit of million  of which million were placed in the cdars program 
the increase in our cdars deposits is primarily due to our participation in the network s one way buy program 
this program allows us to post a bid rate for cdars network banking customers to simply place deposits with us

business segment operations we provide banking and non banking financial services and products through our subsidiaries 
we operate in three business segments  commercial banking  mortgage banking and wealth management and trust services 
the commercial banking segment includes both commercial and consumer lending and provides customers such products as commercial loans  real estate loans  and other business financing and consumer loans 
in addition  this segment also provides customers with various deposit products including demand deposit accounts  savings accounts and certificates of deposit 
the mortgage banking segment engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis

table of contents during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash impairment loss of million pretax million after tax through the wealth management and trust services business segment 
no such impairments occurred during and capital resources capital adequacy is an important measure of financial stability and performance 
our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence 
regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of a financial institution 
the guidelines define capital as both tier which includes common shareholders equity  defined to include certain debt obligations and tier to include certain other debt obligations and a portion of the allowance for loan losses and of unrealized gains in equity securities 
shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million  compared to million at december  for the year ended december   we recorded net income of million  which primarily caused the increase in shareholders equity during accumulated other comprehensive income increased million for the year ended december  total shareholders equity to total assets at december  and was and  respectively

table of contents liquidity liquidity in the banking industry is defined as the ability to meet the demand for funds of both depositors and borrowers 
we must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non cash items into cash 
the objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers 
stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position 
we believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations  personal service and pricing 
in addition to deposits  we have access to the different wholesale funding markets 
these markets include the brokered cd market  the repurchase agreement market and the federal funds market 
during  we joined the certificates of deposit account registry services cdars 
cdars allows banking customers to access fdic insurance protection on multi million dollar certificates of deposit through our bank 
when a customer places a large deposit through cdars  funds are placed into certificates of deposit with other banks in the cdars network in increments of less than  so that principal and interest are eligible for fdic insurance protection 
we also maintain secured lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of richmond and the federal home loan bank of atlanta for which we can borrow up to the allowable amount for the collateral pledged 
having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding 
cash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets can also provide funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers 
we have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management 
for our liquidity management program  we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet 
in this forecast  we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion 
we also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios  from moderate to severe 
guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs 
liquid assets  which include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale  totaled million at december   or of total assets 
we held investments that are classified as held to maturity in the amount of million at december  to maintain ready access to the bank s secured lines of credit  the bank has pledged roughly half of its investment securities and a portion of its commercial real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios to the federal home loan bank of atlanta with additional investment securities and certain loans in its commercial industrial loan portfolios pledged to the federal reserve bank of richmond 
additional borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank of atlanta at december  was approximately million 
borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of richmond was approximately million at december  these facilities are subject to the fhlb and the federal reserve approving disbursement to us 
in addition  we have unsecured federal funds purchased lines of million available to us 
we anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 
contractual obligations we have entered into a number of long term contractual obligations to support our ongoing activities 
these contractual obligations will be funded through operating revenues and liquidity sources held or available to us and exclude contractual interest costs  where applicable 
during the first quarter of  we implemented two cost of funds reduction strategies related to our fhlb advances 
approximately million of these advances with near term maturities were extended by an average maturity of years 
we are now paying an average on these borrowings  a yield reduction of 
table of contents  equating to approximately  in interest expense annually 
these transactions pushed our fhlb advance funding further out from the year maturity term to the year maturity term 
the required payments under such obligations excluding interest were as follows table contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations certificates of deposit brokered certificates of deposit advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta trust preferred securities operating lease obligations total financial instruments with off balance sheet risk and credit risk we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the bank s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis and require collateral to support financial instruments when deemed necessary 
the amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management s evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include deposits held by us  marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates up to one year or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
these instruments represent obligations to extend credit or guarantee borrowings and are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the rates and terms of these instruments are competitive with others in the market in which we do business 
unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed 

table of contents standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we hold certificates of deposit  deposit accounts  and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
a summary of the contract amount of the bank s exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and  is as follows in thousands financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit of million as of december  were related to george mason s mortgage loan funding commitments and were of a short term nature 
commitments to extend credit of million primarily have floating rates as of december  it is uncertain as to the amount that we will be required to fund on these commitments as many such arrangements expire with no amount drawn 
we have counter party risk which may arise from the possible inability of george mason s third party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts 
george mason works with third party investors that are generally well capitalized  are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk 
we do not expect any third party investor to fail to meet its obligation 
in addition  we have derivative counterparty risk relating to three interest rate swaps we have with third parties 
this risk may arise from the inability of the third party to meet the terms of the contract 
we continuously monitor the financial condition of these third parties 
we do not expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations 
george mason provides for its estimated exposure to repurchase loans previously sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor  and for other exposure to its investors related to loan sales activities 
we evaluate the merits of each claim and estimate the reserve based on actual and expected claims received and consider the historical amounts paid to settle such claims 
during the past two years  we have taken steps to limit our exposure to such loan repurchases through agreements entered into with various investors 
as a result  during  we received a limited number of additional claims 
at december  and  we were not aware of any potential loan repurchases or settlements 
during and  george mason either repurchased from or settled with investors on such loans for a total of  and million  respectively 
quarterly data the following table provides quarterly data for the years ended december  and quarterly per share results may not calculate to the year end per share results due to rounding

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing our liquidity requirements and maximizing our net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
interest rate risk arises because the assets of the bank and the liabilities of the bank have different maturities and characteristics 
in order to measure this interest rate risk  we use a simulation process that measures the impact of changing 
table of contents interest rates on net interest income 
this model is run for the bank by an independent consulting firm 
the simulations incorporate assumptions related to expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are developed for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as interest checking  money market checking  savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit 
based on inputs that include the most recent period end balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that interest rates remain unchanged 
this becomes the base case 
next  the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
the down basis point scenario was discontinued given the current level of interest rates 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually moved up basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   our asset liability position was neutral based on our interest rate sensitivity model 
our net interest income would decrease by less than in a down basis point scenario and would increase by less than in an up basis point scenario over a one year time frame 
in the two year time horizon  our net interest income would decrease by less than in a down basis point scenario and would increase by less than in an up basis point scenario 
see also interest rate sensitivity in item above for a discussion of our interest rate risk 
we have counter party risk which may arise from the possible inability of george mason s third party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts 
george mason works with third party investors that are generally well capitalized  are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk 
we do not expect any third party investor to fail to meet its obligation 
in addition  we have derivative counterparty risk relating to certain interest rate swaps we have with third parties 
this risk may arise from the inability of the third party to meet the terms of the contract 
we monitor the financial condition of these third parties on an annual basis 
we do not expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations
