item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview on february   we welcomed mr 
robert p 
bauer as our new president and chief executive officer 
mr 
bauer replaced stan l 
hasselbusch who  after serving as president and chief executive officer for ten years  retired effective february  during  we undertook the following initiatives to enhance shareholder value we commenced a quarterly dividend of per share 
we purchased  shares for million under a million share repurchase plan announced in may in december  the uprr opted not to extend the supply agreement and lease for our grand island  ne tie facility 
production for the remaining orders from this facility was completed during the first quarter of we wound down operations and dismantled the facility during the first half of and closed the plant in february as a result of this closure  we recorded within cost of goods sold approximately million in charges consisting of a million charge to fulfill a customer contractual obligation that could not be sourced from grand island  ne  a million charge for unsalable concrete ties  and a million charge for concrete ties supplied to a midwestern transit agency 
sales from this facility were million in compared to million in in may  we entered into a new million revolving credit and security agreement with a group of four banks 
the agreement provides for a five year  unsecured revolving credit facility that permits borrowing up to million for the us borrowers  including a sublimit of the equivalent of million us dollars that is available to the canadian borrowers 
providing no event of default exists  the agreement contains a provision that provides for an increase in the revolver facility of million that can be allocated to existing or new lenders if our borrowing requirements should grow 
the agreement also includes a sublimit of million for the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit 
finally  during  we made substantial progress integrating portec into our existing businesses to leverage off of each company s core competencies  merge certain administrative functions and reduce duplicative costs 
developments union pacific railroad product warranty claim on july  the union pacific railroad uprr notified us and our subsidiary  cxt incorporated cxt  of a warranty claim under cxt s supply contract relating to the sale of prestressed concrete railroad ties for the uprr 
the uprr has asserted that a significant percentage of concrete ties manufactured in through at cxt s grand island  ne facility fail to meet contract specifications  have workmanship defects and are cracking and failing prematurely 
approximately million ties were sold from grand island to the uprr during the period the uprr has claimed nonconformance 
the contract calls for each concrete tie which fails to conform to the specifications or has a material defect in workmanship to be replaced with new concrete ties  provided  that uprr within five years of a concrete tie s production  notifies cxt of such failure to conform or such defect in workmanship 
the uprr s notice does not specify how many ties manufactured during this period are defective nor which specifications it claims were not met or the nature of the alleged workmanship defects 
cxt believes it uses sound workmanship processes in the manufacture of concrete ties and has not agreed with the assertions in the uprr s warranty claim notice 
the uprr has also notified cxt that ties have failed a certain test that is specified in the contract 

table of contents since late july  the company and cxt have been working with material scientists and prestressed concrete experts  who have been testing a representative sample of grand island concrete ties 
while this testing is not complete  we have not identified any appreciable defects in workmanship 
additionally  a customer of the uprr has claimed that a representative sample of ties manufactured by our grand island facility have failed a test contained in our product specification 
as a result of this specific allegation  the uprr has informed the company that they currently intend to remove approximately  ties from track  which are a subset of ties subject to the july  claim 
we are reviewing this claim and  while our review is not complete  we continue to believe that these ties do not have a material deviation from our contractual specifications 
we expect that the testing required to address this product specification issue will be completed sometime during the latter part of the second quarter of  however  we expect that we will continue to work collaboratively with the uprr to address their overall product claim for some time to come 
on january   cxt received a subpoena from the united states department of transportation inspector general ig requesting records related to its manufacture of concrete railroad ties in grand island  nebraska 
we believe that this subpoena relates to the same set of circumstances giving rise to the uprr product claim 
cxt and the company intend to cooperate fully with the ig 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  this investigation will have on the uprr s product claim 
based on the non specific nature of the uprr s assertion and our current inability to verify the claims  we are unable to determine a range of reasonably possible outcomes regarding this potential exposure matter 
as a result  no accruals were made as a result of this claim as the impact  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
no assurances can be given regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter 
the ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material  adverse impact on our financial statements  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
portec acquisition included in our rail products segment are the results of operations for our portec subsidiary 
we acquired portec on december  for approximately million in cash 
portec reported net sales of million  gross profit of million  total expenses of million and net income of million for the year ended december  the acquisition period consisted of approximately two weeks from the acquisition date through december  therefore  the results of operations portion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations will not include a substantive comparison of the portec results 
portec contributed million in net sales  million in gross profit and a net loss of million in the two week period from the acquisition date through december  other matters we recorded incremental warranty charges of approximately million during the fourth quarter  a portion of which was related to a product issue with a transit authority and the remainder for concrete ties based on historical claim experience 
no charges have been recorded related specifically for the uprr product claim dated july  these charges were recorded within cost of goods sold and reported through our rail products segment 
during  we provided the lessor of our houston  tx property with written notice of our termination of the lease in its entirety effective april  as a result of this termination  we recognized  of previously deferred gain 
at december   approximately  of unrecognized deferred gain is being amortized over the remaining life of the lease

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstance 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
goodwill goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of october st and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present 
the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss 
this step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded as a component of continuing operations 
the company uses a combination of market approach and a discounted cash flow model dcf model to determine the current fair value of the business 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volume and pricing  costs to produce and working capital changes 
the company considers historical experience and available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated 
however  actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  the company may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
there were no goodwill impairments recorded during the three years ended december  asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies the guidance in fasb asc  and related guidance  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this guidance indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period and because it requires management to make assumptions about the existence of impairment indicators and cash flows over future years 
these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment  which would have an impact on the income statement 
there were no asset impairments recorded during the three years ended december  
table of contents allowance for bad debts the company s operating segments encounter risks associated with the collection of accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company reviews its accounts receivable aging and calculates an allowance through application of historic reserve factors to overdue receivables 
this calculation is supplemented by specific account reviews performed by the company s credit department 
as necessary  the application of the company s allowance rates to specific customers is reviewed and adjusted to more accurately reflect the credit risk inherent within that customer relationship 
the reserve is reviewed on a monthly basis 
an account receivable is written off against the allowance when management determines it is uncollectible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for bad debts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
specific customer circumstances and general economic conditions may vary significantly from management s assumptions and may impact expected earnings 
at december  and  the company maintained an allowance for bad debts of million and million  respectively 
product warranty the company maintains a current warranty for the repair or replacement of defective products 
for certain manufactured products  an accrual is made on a monthly basis as a percentage of cost of sales 
for long term construction projects  a warranty is established when the claim is known and quantifiable 
the product warranty accrual is periodically adjusted based on the identification or resolution of known individual product warranty claims 
the company believes that this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used to calculate the warranty can change from period to period 
at december  and  the product warranty was million and million  respectively 
for additional information regarding the company s product warranty  refer to part ii  item  footnote commitments and contingent liabilities 
slow moving inventory slow moving inventory is reviewed and adjusted routinely  taking into account numerous factors such as quantities on hand versus turnover  product knowledge  and physical inventory observations 
this review is performed on a specific product basis and effectively establishes a new cost for the underlying product 
the company believes this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period and could have a material impact on the income statement 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are composed of product sales and products and services provided under long term contracts 
for product sales  the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of title to the customer 
title generally passes to the customer upon shipment 
in limited cases  title does not transfer and revenue is not recognized until the customer has received the products at its physical location 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
revenues for products under long term contracts are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
for certain products  the percentage of completion is based upon actual labor costs to estimated total labor costs 
revenues recognized using percentage of completion were less than of the company s consolidated revenues for the year ended december  with the addition of portec  the contribution of revenues recognized using percentage of completion is expected to continue to decline in future periods 
pension plans the calculation of the company s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in a different pension expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ significantly from the assumptions 
the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 

table of contents the expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the plan s investment mix and the forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with applicable guidance  generally fasb asc  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return determined by the company for and pension expense was and  respectively 
pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases 
the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
in estimating that rate  applicable guidance requires that the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the company s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced 
therefore  the decline in the assumed discount rate has the effect of increasing the company s pension obligation and future pension expense 
the weighted average assumed discount rate used by the company was and  respectively  as of december  and deferred tax assets the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make judgments regarding the future realization of these assets 
as prescribed by fasb asc  income taxes  valuation allowances must be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not a likelihood more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this guidance requires management to evaluate positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
determination of whether the positive evidence outweighs the negative and quantification of the valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and judgments of future financial results 
the company believes that these estimates and judgments are critical accounting estimates 
the company evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
for positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria  an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement  is determined 
a previously recognized tax position is derecognized when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained 
the evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment  historical experience and on various other assumptions 
the results of these estimates  that are not readily apparent from other sources  form the basis for recognizing an uncertain tax position liability 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
refer to part ii  item  footnote  income taxes 
the company s ability to realize these tax benefits may affect the company s reported income tax expense and net income 
contingencies the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
when a probable  estimable exposure exists  the company accrues the estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings 

table of contents the company s operations are subject to national  state  foreign  provincial  and or local laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of  and establish standards for the use  disposal  and management of  regulated materials and waste  and that impose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up  and damages resulting from  present and past spills  disposals  or other releases of hazardous substances or materials 
liabilities are recorded when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
estimates are not reduced by potential claims for recovery 
claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties or as amounts are received 
established reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress  prospective estimates of required activity  and other factors that may be relevant  including changes in technology or regulations 
as of december  and  the company maintained environmental and legal contingency reserves approximating million and million  respectively

 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the standard does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
the update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the guidance will have no impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations

fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter company analysis diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of were  even with diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of both gross profit and gross profit margin increased due to the inclusion of portec s results  partially offset by an unfavorable lifo charge to gross profit during the current period 
this similar adjustment for lifo reserve requirements had a positive impact for the prior year period 

table of contents the addition of portec resulted in increased selling and administrative expenses of approximately million 
exclusive of the impact of portec  selling and administrative expenses in the period increased approximately million due mainly to approximately million in testing expenses for material scientists and prestressed concrete experts related to the uprr product warranty claim 
as a result of the acquisition of portec  amortization expense increased by approximately million and we recognized increased transactional foreign exchange losses for the three months ended december  primarily related to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the united states dollar 
also  we recognized more previously deferred gains associated with the early termination of a lease for our threaded products facility in houston  tx 
finally  having a positive impact in the fourth quarter was the recognition of a million pre tax gain associated with the remeasurement of our holding of portec equity securities prior to our december  acquisition 
the effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of was compared to in the prior year quarter

additionally  our rail distribution business experienced a reduction in volumes sold  primarily from our decision to deemphasize the relay rail business 
the quarter also included a large new rail project which was completed prior to the quarter 
portec delivered approximately million in gross profit increases  while foster rail gross profit decreased by million 
exclusive of the impact of portec  our rail products gross profit margin would have increased approximately basis points as compared to the quarter 
our transit products division drove this increase due mainly to product mix compared to the prior year quarter 
additionally  while our rail distribution business had reduced volumes  offsetting this were price increases which delivered gross profit margin expansion over the prior year period 
mitigating these favorable improvements were the adverse cost of sales charges recorded by cxt 
mainly related to our now closed grand island  ne facility  this division recorded additional concrete tie warranty charges of approximately million in the quarter  a portion of which was related to a product issue with a transit authority and the remainder for concrete ties based on historical claim experience

additionally  new orders in the fourth quarter have decreased approximately from the period 
these cumulative effects have resulted in negative impacts on sales and gross profit in the current quarter 
the fourth quarter sales were negatively impacted by lower piling volumes and  to a lesser extent  lower concrete buildings volumes 
the loss of federal stimulus spending led to more normalized sales of concrete buildings  a decrease of approximately over the quarter 
product mix within our piling division had an unfavorable impact on the prior year quarter  but drove the overall increase in gross profit margin for the segment in this margin increase  albeit over decreased volumes  fully offset margin declines in our concrete buildings division due to increased unfavorable manufacturing variances resulting from reduced sales volumes

table of contents approximately million of the increase in selling and administrative expenses relates to portec 
exclusive of the impact of portec  selling and administrative expenses in the period increased approximately million due primarily to higher outside services expenses million and higher salaries million 
we recognized approximately million for testing expenses associated with the uprr product warranty claim  million in portec integration costs and million associated with other outside service providers in these increased expenses offset the elimination of the approximately million in acquisition costs we recognized during the acquisition of portec led to the increase in amortization expense and our recognition of transactional foreign exchange gains 
included in net income for the current period is our share of the income from our equity investment in the jv  which is reported as equity in income loss of nonconsolidated investment 
as the jv had not yet commenced significant revenue generating activities  we recorded our share of its start up related expenses in the increased amount we recognized during from the deferred gain related to a revision in the remaining term of the operating lease associated with our houston  tx sale leaseback transaction mitigated the reduction in pre tax gains we recognized in connection with our acquisition of portec 
the effective income tax rate for was compared to in the decrease was primarily due to lower statutory tax rates related to the foreign operations acquired in the portec business combination  the release of million of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and the receipt of million in certain state income tax refunds 
the year compared to the year company analysis net income for was per diluted share  compared to net income of per diluted share for while included a pre tax gain of million on the sale of a portion of our investment in portec  included a pre tax gain of million recognized on the remaining available for sale investment due to the requirement to remeasure its fair value on the acquisition date 
the improvement in gross profit is due  in part  to negative adjustments of approximately million taken in the period related to concrete tie issues as well as a significant improvement in manufacturing variances 
gross profit also increased over due to a favorable million resolution of a supply chain dispute 
we account for a portion of our inventory under the lifo method 
the lifo reserve requirements can be positively or negatively impacted by falling or rising prices 
the credit to gross profit resulting from this lifo adjustment was million lower in than in  as there was greater price volatility in the prior year 
the foremost causes of the increased selling and administrative costs for the year to date period were million for acquisition costs  million for compensation expenses and million for bad debt expense  due to a recovery recorded in for  we recorded a million loss from our jv equity method investment 
our effective income tax rate for the period  decreased compared to the period   due to increased domestic manufacturing credits partially offset by certain acquisition costs that were not deductible for tax purposes

dollars in thousands net sales gross profit gross profit percentage the year compared to the year our acquisition of portec increased our rail products segment sales by approximately million 
exclusive of the impact of portec  our rail products segment sales increased approximately million over the period 
improved sales volumes within our rail distribution business led the segment s sales growth 
while both of our operational tie plants had volume increases yielding sales growth of at least  they could not overcome the loss of sales due to the closure of our grand island  ne facility 
this negative impact on segment sales partially mitigated the favorable growth from our rail distribution business 
portec is responsible for the increase in our rail products segment gross profit margin 
exclusive of the impact of portec  our rail products gross profit margin would have decreased to from in this decrease is related to the adverse charges we recorded related to our exit from grand island  ne and adjustments to tie warranty based on historical claim experience 
while none of these charges relate to the uprr product warranty claim dated july  and related matters  a summary of the charges we recorded include million to fulfill a customer contractual obligation  million for concrete tie warranty reserve requirements  million for unsalable inventory  and million for concrete ties supplied to a midwestern transit agency 
excluding these charges and the accretive impact of portec  our rail products segment would have reported increased gross profit 
we believe that slowly but steadily increasing rail traffic and strong forecasted spending by the class railroads bode well for continued strong results in our rail products segment and we will continue to work collaboratively with the uprr in an effort to bring it s product warranty claim to a satisfactory resolution 
the year compared to the year the leader of sales growth within our rail products segment was our cxt concrete tie division 
in addition to increased purchases by the uprr in  prior year sales by this division were reduced by million when the uprr refused to accept certain ties produced at our grand island  ne facility due to the alleged quality of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing process 
both our arp and transit divisions benefitted from improved volumes over the prior year period 
finally  our new portec subsidiary contributed million in additional net sales since the acquisition date 

table of contents improvements in our rail products gross profit were due primarily to charges of million related to concrete tie issues 
gross profit also increased over due to a favorable million resolution of a supply chain dispute 
additionally  improvements in selling margins including improved material variances  as well as improved manufacturing variances  had a positive impact on reported results 
lastly  while portec increased our rail products segment gross profit by approximately million  it had no impact on our gross profit margin 
portec s gross profit included an increase to cost of goods sold of million related to recognition of a portion of the inventory step up to fair value from portec s purchase price allocation

dollars in thousands net sales gross profit gross profit percentage the year compared to the year was a mixed year for our construction products segment with our piling and fabricated bridge division s growth in sales being entirely offset by declines in our concrete buildings division 
the growth in piling was almost entirely due to increased volumes while was a record sales year for our fabricated bridge division 
however  in the absence of federal stimulus legislation  our concrete buildings division returned to normalized levels  having decreased approximately from the period 
our construction products segment s gross profit margin declined due to the flat performance reported by our piling division and due to sales volume reductions within our concrete buildings division 
we continue to have a mixed outlook for the markets we participate in under our construction products segment 
our piling backlog at december  is approximately lower than last year and  while we do see certain projects moving forward  we expect every large project to be competitively bid 
while we expect another strong year in our fabricated products business  the backlog in that business is also down substantially and there can be significant lead times between winning a project and commencing production 
a number of other factors that may create further headwinds in these markets include approximately states currently have  or are projecting to have  fiscal year budget deficits 
federal legislation  safetea lu  authorizing transportation construction funding which expired in september and has been temporarily extended through march  the year compared to the year all of the divisions within our construction products segment experienced strong sales increases in our piling division s robust growth in sales volumes of sheet piling more than offset any pricing declines experienced by other piling products 
additionally  our concrete building division  realizing benefits from federal spending partially due to the stimulus legislation  delivered sales growth in finally  our fabricated products division continued to benefit from customer preference for our bridge decking solution 
while sales have improved somewhat in from their levels  the backlog within this division is up approximately over our construction products gross profit margin improved in all divisions with the exception of piling 
our piling division has experienced margin compression due to an intensely competitive bidding environment and a weak industrial market

we anticipate robust activity levels in both of our tubular products divisions throughout the year compared to the year the tubular products segment sales increase was driven primarily by our coated products division that rebounded from the recession driven downturn it experienced in as well as to sales increases in our threaded products division 
our tubular products gross profit was significantly improved as our threaded products division returned to profitability after being negatively impacted by reductions in pipe pricing  unfavorable manufacturing variances and slow moving inventory charges in the prior year period and  to a lesser extent  sales increases in our coated products division

other long term liabilities include items such as income taxes which are not contractual obligations by nature

off balance sheet arrangements the company s off balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases  purchase obligations and standby letters of credit disclosed in the liquidity and capital resources section in the contractual obligations table 
these arrangements provide the company with increased flexibility relative to the utilization and investment of cash resources 

table of contents outlook the company achieved record net sales and positive earnings results despite costs incurred related to our previously disclosed issues from closing our grand island facility as well as with certain concrete ties manufactured by that facility 
we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from strengthening rail and energy markets in which we participate but may continue to see a weakened construction market through class railroad capital spending increased approximately in and we anticipate an additional increase of approximately to in north american rail traffic also increased in and thus far  slight increases have also been reported for the first nine weeks of as well  which bodes well for our rail business 
our tubular energy divisions ended with increased backlogs and active markets and we anticipate strong results from this segment in we will have relocated our threaded products unit to its new facility by the end of the first quarter and while we anticipate certain costs to be incurred related to relocation as well as plant start up costs  we are optimistic about the increased opportunities and efficiencies related to the modernized facility and equipment 
in construction products we face softer market conditions where our backlog is lower compared to last year and the renewal of favorable transportation legislation in the united states remains uncertain 
additionally  out of states have budget deficits that may present challenges to many of the end markets in which we sell  given our reliance on government funding 
certain of our businesses rely heavily on spending authorized by the federal highway and transportation funding bill  safetea lu  enacted in august this legislation authorized billion for united states transportation improvement spending over a six year period and expired in september in september  the united states congress extended this legislation through march  while certain estimates of the amounts that may be authorized under successor legislation to safetea lu range from billion over two years to billion over six years  there is uncertainty as to the timing of the renewal of this multi year surface transportation legislation and how such legislation will actually be funded 
we do  however  anticipate a slowly improving economy in and we also expect to be profitable and generate cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures  debt service  dividends and share repurchases 
although backlog is not necessarily indicative of future operating results  total company backlog at december  was approximately million 
the following table provides the backlog by business segment december  in thousands backlog rail products construction products tubular products total backlog while a considerable portion of the foster business is somewhat backlog driven  the portec business is less sensitive to backlog at any given time 
we are currently at approximately capacity utilization for the uprr at our tucson  az facility 
we hope to extend the supply agreement for this facility which expires on december  no assurances can be given as to whether the existing uprr product warranty claim will adversely impact our ability to extend this supply agreement 
as of december   we maintained a warranty reserve approximating million for potential warranty claims associated with concrete railroad ties 
while we believe this is a reasonable estimate of our potential contingencies related to identified concrete tie warranty matters  we may incur future charges associated with new customer claims or further development of information for existing customer claims  including the july product claim by the uprr 
thus  there can be no assurance that future potential costs pertaining to warranty claims will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition
