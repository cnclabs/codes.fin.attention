our reportable segments are our operating divisions 
in january  we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of our federal division  and the transaction was completed on march  the federal division met the conditions to be reported as discontinued operations within the financial statements in december  and accordingly  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows have been reclassified for all periods presented in this annual report on form k to conform to the current presentation 
excluding discontinued operations  our operating divisions for consisted of international  north america and it outsourcing 
our international division provides a range of it consulting services  including erp software implementation  application development  systems integration and support services  with sap related solutions and services accounting for approximately of its total revenue in our north america division was formed at the beginning of through the combination of our former custom solutions division and substantially all of our former us erp division 
this division primarily provides application development  integration and support  as well as software implementation services for erp software from software vendors such as oracle  sap and lawson 
our it outsourcing division offers outsourced enterprise infrastructure management solutions  including managed hosted infrastructure  end user service desk and desktop services  rim and application operations support 
beginning in  the it outsourcing division also included our technology solutions practice that provides it infrastructure products 
in addition to the combination of our former custom solutions and us erp divisions in early  we made several other changes in that impacted the amounts we report for our divisions  which included moving certain practices between divisions and moving certain costs between corporate and our operating divisions 
all and segment data has been adjusted to conform to the presentation 
for  we will be combining the operations of our it outsourcing division with our remaining two divisions 

table of contents we recognize the majority of our services revenue under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under fixed price contracts  which currently make up approximately of our services revenue  our revenue is fixed under the contract  while our costs to complete our obligations under the contract are variable 
as a result  our profitability on fixed price contracts can vary significantly and occasionally can even be a loss 
changes in our services revenue are primarily a function of hours worked on revenue generating activities and  to a lesser extent  changes in our average rate per hour and changes in contract mix 
hours worked on revenue producing activities vary with the number of consultants employed and their utilization level 
utilization represents the percentage of time worked on revenue producing engagements divided by the standard hours available ie  hours per week 
with time and materials contracts  higher consultant utilization results in increased revenue  however  with fixed price contracts  it may result in higher costs and lower gross profit margins because our revenue is fixed 
we actively manage both our number of consultants and our overall utilization levels 
if we determine we have excess available resources that we cannot place on billable assignments in the near future  we consider reducing those resources 
as a result  during the last three years  most of our consultant turnover has been from involuntary termination of employment 
the hourly rate we charge for our services varies based on the level of the consultant involved  the particular expertise of the consultant and the geographic area 
our typical time and materials hourly rates range from to per hour 
as india based resources become more significant  our average hourly rates will decrease 
for projects which are fixed price  cost plus or level of effort  where our revenue is not directly based on hours incurred  our realized rate per hour will vary significantly depending on success or overages on such projects  as well as the blend of estimated resources used to deliver projects 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs as a percentage of revenue vary by business segment 
close to of our overall sg a expenses are typically for personnel costs for our operations management  sales and recruiting personnel and administrative staff  as well as our corporate office support staff and executive management personnel 
although these costs are not immediately affected by changes in revenue  there is often a relatively short term correlation between these sg a salary expenses and revenue 
additionally  as we bid on larger and longer term projects  the sales cycle and related sales costs have been increasing 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software and commissions on sales of it products 
our sales of it hardware and software generally involve it network infrastructure 
the gross profit margin on consolidated other revenues is typically in the range of to 
this is a blend of low margin hardware sales typically a to gross margin  mid margin software sales typically a to gross margin and higher margin product commissions and proprietary software sales 
depending on the mix of these business activities  gross profit margin on other revenue will fluctuate 
the market demand for ciber s services is heavily dependent on it spending by major corporations  organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve 
in the last three to four years  economic recession and volatile economic conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients and prospects and caused fluctuations in their it spending behaviors 
in  current economic conditions began to have a greater negative impact on clients in a number of our international division s territories 
the pace of technological advancement and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide 
representing nearly half of our consolidated revenues  our international division operates primarily in western europe 
these operations transact business in local currencies of the countries in which they operate 
in recent years  generally to of our international division s revenue has been denominated in euros  to has been denominated in great britain pounds gbp and 
table of contents the balance has come from a number of other european currencies 
changes in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
for financial reporting purposes  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates at period end and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
our results of operations are affected by economic conditions  including macroeconomic conditions  credit market conditions and levels of business confidence 
revenue is driven by our ability to secure new contracts and deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges 
in recent quarters and ongoing for the foreseeable future  we have been affected by significant efforts by our clients both current and potential to implement cost savings initiatives 
these initiatives have included going to third party vendor management systems  taking their business to larger  pure play offshore vendors and vendor consolidation 
in some cases  these initiatives have benefited ciber  but in others we have lost our revenue stream entirely or seen a decline in our level of revenues with particular clients 
the pricing environment continues to be extremely competitive 
a number of our competitors are structuring more offshore services into their bids  thereby lowering their pricing to help clients reduce costs  and making it more difficult for us to compete on pricing 
we also have global delivery options to offer to our current and potential clients as possible cost savings  and we are expanding our offshore capabilities and increasing the usage of these resources  however  they are on a smaller scale than the offshore offerings of some of our competitors 
another issue which has had and continues to have an impact on our revenues and profitability involves a much longer sales cycle than we have seen historically  which has been driven by a much slower decision making process in starting new projects in a variety of industries that we currently serve  or in which we are currently bidding for work 
the longer sales cycle increases the cost of our sales efforts and pushes potential revenues and profitability further into the future 
some clients remain cautious  seeking flexibility by shifting to a more phased approach to contracting for work 
over the past year  we have tightened our standards governing the quality of engagements that we will accept with the goal of growing revenue  increasing margins  improving collectability of receivables and delivering sustained  predictable performance 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful with such actions  and in certain cases  these actions may slow our revenue growth 
economic conditions and other factors continue to impact the business operations of many of our clients  their ability to continue to use our services and their financial ability to pay for our services in full 
the impact of project cancellations cannot be accurately predicted and bad debt expense will differ from our estimates  and any such events may negatively impact our results of operations 
discontinued operations on january   we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of our federal division to crgt  inc for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash  subject to adjustment based on the final calculation of the working capital of the federal division at the time of closing 
the transaction closed on march  net cash proceeds from this sale  including transaction related costs  are estimated to be in the range of million 
at december   the carrying value of the net assets of the federal division was approximately million 
based on our estimates of related working capital and transaction related fees and expenses and other exit costs  we expect to record a net gain of approximately million in the federal division met the conditions to be reported as a discontinued operation within the financial statements in december  and accordingly  the financial position  results of operations and cash flows have been reclassified for all periods to conform to the current period s presentation 

table of contents the following table summarizes the operating results of the discontinued operations included in the consolidated statements of operations year ended december  in thousands total revenues operating expenses goodwill impairment operating income loss from discontinued operations interest and other expense income loss from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax federal division revenues declined in due to the ongoing delay in new contract awards and minimal funding of existing contracts due to government budgetary uncertainties and downsized contracts for two large engagements 
the federal division had an operating loss  excluding goodwill impairment  of million in as compared to operating profit of million in the results were negatively impacted by million of bad debt expense for a non government project  as well as a large amount of low margin material sales and lower margins obtained on renewal business 
operating income  excluding goodwill impairment  improved to million in due to several cost reduction initiatives  as well as a modest increase from new contract awards at higher margins 
during the quarter ended december   the government services market continued to decline due to further funding uncertainty and downside risk for the sector 
long term federal it spending forecasts decreased significantly in the overall market  and we noted a continued market capitalization decline in the publicly traded companies in our comparable group 
in addition to such factors  we were also required to perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill upon meeting the criteria to classify the federal division as held for sale  as the negotiated sales price was below the carrying value of the related net assets 
we performed step two of the goodwill impairment test as of december   and adjusted the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value  which was based on our estimate of net sales proceeds to result from our january agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of the federal division 
this resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million 
also  during our annual impairment test in  and as a result of the impact that the depressed economic environment had on overall equity values and its negative impact on our operations and forecasted cash flows  as well as the sustained decline in our market capitalization  we recorded goodwill impairment of million for the federal division

results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and consolidated the following tables and related discussion provide information about our consolidated financial results for the periods presented 
as previously noted  our federal division has been classified as discontinued operations and therefore is excluded in the results from our continuing operations in the tables and related discussion below  unless otherwise noted

total revenues increased million  or  for compared with constant currency adjusted revenue decreased less than between the comparable years 
our june acquisition of a danish sap company contributed an additional million of revenue  or of revenue growth  to the current year over the prior year 
significant growth in our international division  boosted by favorable currency rates during the second and third quarters  as well as increased revenues in our it outsourcing division offset decreased revenues from our north america division 
revenue by segment from continuing operations was as follows year ended december  change in thousands international north america it outsourcing total segment revenues corporate inter segment   n m total revenues n m not meaningful 
table of contents international division revenues improved by and approximately on a constant currency basis 
the june acquisition contributed to international revenue growth in the current year 
the remainder of our constant currency adjusted revenue growth was due to increased sales volume in our core territories  primarily for sap related services and expansion in our german based managed services practice  which was a start up business in our strategy of focusing on key technologies and verticals has yielded some positive results in our international division  especially in the manufacturing and energy verticals over the past year 
although international revenue growth was for  the division experienced a substantial deceleration in revenue growth rates throughout the year  particularly between the third and fourth quarters 
the deceleration is attributed to a number of factors such as canceled or completed projects  lack of availability of certain skilled sap resources and economic conditions negatively impacting some of our clients and territories 
we have seen certain larger european clients focusing on cost cutting measures such as vendor consolidation  offshoring  and increasing pricing pressures on service providers  as well as project delays and cancellations 
our largest international division client accounted for of the division s revenues 
the level of overall services we provided to this client increased in as compared with last year  however  during the fourth quarter they began cost reduction initiatives  which included reductions in the level of services provided by us 
this client  like most of our clients  has the ability to reduce their use of our services on relatively short notice 
based on current economic conditions  it is reasonable to expect some uncertainty in the international market for it spend in  at least in some of the primary countries where we operate  and we expect competition to continue to increase as companies compete for a reduced number of opportunities 
the decrease in north america revenues was predominantly due to our inability to sufficiently replace revenue from concluded projects and from reductions in the level of services provided at a number of other clients 
erp implementation revenue declined by approximately million in our inability to replace revenue was due to a number of factors 
we have experienced some operational inefficiencies that were created during our transition away from our previous branch model to a matrixed operating model structured around strategic service offerings and key verticals 
additionally  the current year division leadership transition delayed efforts to focus on new revenue growth opportunities 
our weaker than expected sales performance related to prioritizing sales of higher margin  solutions based services  which have a longer sales cycle  and a number of sales members that weren t fully productive during the current year 
we believe that the decline in north america revenues began to stabilize near the end of and that our sales force is gaining the focus needed to successfully sell services and solutions in our key verticals in it outsourcing revenue improved during the current year  primarily related to expansion of services at several existing clients 
the division was not able to add any significant new accounts during  and in the fourth quarter showed a sequential quarterly revenue decline of due to an engagement cancellation 
this client had represented approximately of the division s annualized revenue  which will impact the division s ability to grow in gross profit 
in total  our gross profit margin decreased basis points to for  compared to for decreased revenues  lower consultant utilization and some low margin fixed price projects in our north america division were the predominant reasons for the decline in overall gross profit margin in the international division increased its overall gross margin by approximately basis points in  a significant portion of which was due to current year improved profitability of our german based managed services practice  a start up business that was in the investment stages for much of current year international gross margin was also positively impacted by the full year benefit from a june acquisition 
further improvements to the international division s gross profit margin remain limited by our continued reliance on more expensive 
table of contents subcontractor labor  as we remain unable to hire enough skilled resources  especially for sap projects 
additionally  increased pricing pressures from customers could negatively impact gross profit margins in selling  general and administrative costs 
our sg a costs increased million  or less than  to million for  from million for increased sg a costs of million in our international division were partially offset by decreases in our other divisions and corporate sg a 
the increase in the international division was predominantly related to salary costs  mainly for additional sales and recruiting salaries  as well as higher severance expenses 
international also incurred higher facilities and support costs  which increase with headcount growth 
bad debt expense also declined by million in from the prior year 
north america implemented cost cutting measures in the second half of in response to the division s continued revenue decline  which contributed considerably to the million reduction of sg a costs in the division 
additionally  corporate sg a expenses declined due to reductions in costs related to executive severance and transition 
sg a costs as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to for from for operating loss 
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the second quarter of each year  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge in for our it outsourcing division while in we recorded an million impairment for our north america division 
including the impairment charges  we had operating losses of million and million in and  respectively 
earnings before interest  taxes and amortization ebita declined by to million in from million last year  primarily as a result of the north america revenue decline and its resulting impact on gross profit and the negative impacts from some low margin fixed price contracts more than offsetting our international division s growth and profit improvements and our reduced corporate expenses

operating income margin improved basis points in  driven by increased gross margins related in large part to the positive contribution from our german managed services business  which was in start up mode for much of the previous year  as well as the full year impact of a june acquisition 
these margin improvements were partially offset by an increase in sg a costs as a percentage of revenue  primarily for increased salary costs related to business expansion 

table of contents north america operating income decreased to million in from million for primarily related to the negative impact of service level reductions and concluded engagements 
low margin fixed price projects and costs incurred by the division to exit several of these fixed price contracts and  to a lesser extent  decreased consultant utilization also reduced operating income 
in  north america operating income was negatively impacted by approximately million from exiting certain contracts or from contracts with losses 
in addition  we estimate that the division s operating income was reduced by million due to cost overruns on fixed price projects that reduced project profits below our expected margins 
as part of our normal business operations  we expect to have some low margin projects and even some unprofitable projects from time to time 
the division began cost reduction initiatives during the second half of  including staff reductions and discretionary spending curtailments  but was unable to reduce costs as quickly as revenue declined 
it outsourcing had operating income of million in compared with an operating loss of million in the improvement was due to a reduction in expenses related to both direct costs and sg a cost control initiatives 
corporate expenses were down million 
during  we incurred million of executive charges and leadership transition costs and we recorded a million bad debt allowance 
in  we recorded million of severance costs 
the reductions in bad debt and separation type expenses were partially offset by increased it costs and share based compensation in interest expense

table of contents our domestic loss from continuing operations includes goodwill impairment charges of million in and million in these goodwill impairment charges were partially subject to taxation and resulted in related deferred tax benefits of million and million  respectively 
in  we recorded a deferred tax expense of approximately million to establish a valuation allowance against all of our us deferred tax assets  and we cannot record income tax benefits for any additional us operating losses 
additionally  irrespective of our income or losses in our us operations  we expect in to incur us tax expense of approximately million  primarily as a result of deferred taxes related to goodwill 
for purposes of deferred taxes  we estimate our domestic blended federal and state rate to be approximately 
for our significant foreign operations  the foreign tax rates range from approximately to 
our actual tax expense is also impacted by the amount of non deductible expenses  which increases our effective tax rate 
for interim periods  we base our tax provision on forecasted book and taxable income for the entire year 
as the forecast for the year changes  we adjust our year to date tax provision 
our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and is subject to significant volatility from year to year

table of contents revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  for compared with constant currency adjusted revenues represented a increase over a june acquisition of a danish sap company contributed million of revenue  or of revenue growth in the primary contribution to the increase in revenue growth was from our international division 
revenue by segment from continuing operations was as follows year ended december  change in thousands international north america it outsourcing total segment revenues corporate inter segment   n m total revenues n m not meaningful international division revenues improved and approximately on a constant currency basis 
approximately half of the international division s constant currency adjusted revenue growth related to revenues from our new german based managed services practice and an acquisition completed in june the remaining improvement was generally due to increased revenues from sap related services  particularly in several central european countries 
north america revenues were flat generally related to the ongoing financial impact from a variety of economic factors  such as customer pricing pressures  the implementation of cost saving initiatives at a number of clients  including vendor management systems  offshore services alternatives  vendor consolidation  the attrition of placements at a few larger customer accounts and the completion of several sizable projects 
all of the above resulted in either a decrease in the fees we receive for our services  or decreases in the use of our services 
additionally  we have experienced challenges in obtaining new state and local government contracts and budget issues with new projects in this sector due to the economic climate 
these decreases were predominantly offset by increased revenues from new projects  including erp implementations  as well as increasing demand in the healthcare vertical and related to expansion of our global delivery model 
improved product commissions in our technology solutions practice accounted for a majority of the revenue increase in our it outsourcing division in  as well as account losses being more than offset by account wins in the rest of the it outsourcing business 
gross profit 
in total  our gross profit margin decreased to for  compared to for this decrease was predominantly related to the international gross margin decrease related to the start up of a new german based managed services practice and an increased usage of more expensive subcontractor labor 
additionally  a basis point decrease in our north america division also contributed to the overall gross margin decline 
the decrease in the north america division s gross margin was predominantly caused by overruns on fixed price projects  and was partially offset by the completion of several low margin projects in that division 
gross margin improvement in our it outsourcing division was the result of better margins on several new projects

higher bad debt expense in also accounted for basis points of the increase 
additionally  expansion in our domestic and offshore delivery centers  including india  additional expenses from organizational transition items resulting from the recently adopted strategy of combining north american branch offices  consolidation of the sales and delivery organizations  and investments in sales training and infrastructure  as well as higher management salaries resulting from senior leadership changes  also contributed to the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenue in operating income loss 
during the second quarter of  based on a combination of factors  including the current economic environment  our operating results and a sustained decline in our market capitalization  we recorded an million non cash goodwill impairment charge in north america following our annual goodwill impairment test

table of contents international operating income declined primarily due to our increased usage of subcontractor labor  which is more expensive  and a million operating loss in related to the start up of a new german based managed services practice  both of which impacted the division s gross profit margin 
the gross margin decreases were partially offset by a reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue mainly related to reduced costs for facilities and equipment 
north america operating income decreased primarily due to situations involving two specific erp clients 
gross profit margin was reduced by million related to the reversal of project revenue previously recognized under the percentage of completion method due to revised estimates of project completion 
also  we did not recognize million of revenue on a project for a client whose financial condition deteriorated significantly  although we had continued to provide our services 
we also recorded million of bad debt expense to provide a full allowance for unpaid accounts receivable related to this financially distressed client 
overruns on some fixed price projects  increased usage of higher priced subcontractors and increased sg a costs primarily related to expansion in india and in domestic delivery centers also contributed to the lower operating income 
it outsourcing operating loss improved primarily due to improved gross margins on product sales  as well as improved gross margins related to increased volume in some accounts and higher usage of lower priced offshore resources 
corporate expenses increased in mainly due to million of executive charges and leadership transition costs recorded during the second quarter  plus million of fourth quarter expenses that were primarily related to an additional bad debt allowance recorded 
included in was a million one time charge for the settlement of litigation 
excluding these and charges  corporate expenses increased by approximately million  or basis points  primarily due to increases in salary expense related to management changes and other organization transition related expenses  as well as increased professional and consulting fees  employee benefit costs and added corporate support services

our tax rate was impacted by the goodwill impairment charge and lower domestic operating results 
in  our domestic pre tax loss was million and our foreign pre tax profit was million 
our domestic loss included the million goodwill impairment charge  which was only partially subject to taxation and resulted in a million tax benefit 
our fourth quarter tax rate also had a million benefit from the utilization of carried forward net operating losses in europe  which were previously reserved 
we estimate our blended federal and state rate to be approximately 
for our significant foreign operations  the local tax rates range from approximately to 
our actual tax expense is also impacted by the amount of non deductible expenses  which also increases our effective tax rate 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations  available cash reserves and debt capacity under our senior credit facility  which is scheduled to mature on january  in january  we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of our federal division 
net cash proceeds from this sale  including transaction related costs  are estimated to be in the range of million 
under our january  amendment to our senior credit facility  discussed in more detail below  of the proceeds that are received by us from the sale are in excess of million must be applied to a reduction of the revolving line of credit under the senior credit facility 
as a result of the closing of the sale of our federal division on march   the borrowings available under the revolving line of credit were reduced by million 
we are currently in the process of evaluating alternative bank financing to replace our senior credit facility 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining alternative financing  or that if available to us  the terms of these alternatives  will not be materially less favorable to us 
in addition  we could seek to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our expected operating cash flow  proceeds from the federal division sale  and our senior credit facility or alternative financing will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through at least the next year 
our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at december   compared to million at december  our domestic cash balances are used daily to reduce our outstanding balance on our senior credit facility 
typically  most of our cash balance is maintained by our foreign subsidiaries 
from time to time  we may engage in short term loans from our foreign operations 
on december   we had a short term million loan from our foreign operations  which was repaid in in addition  in order to meet the scheduled principal reduction requirements for the term loan that were accelerated in the october amendment to the senior credit facility  we repatriated million of foreign cash to the us in january due to our domestic net operating loss carryforwards  this repatriation does not result in any material current tax payments 
the repatriation will reduce the available net operating loss carryforwards which are available to offset future domestic profits 
except for the million cash repatriation  we have not provided for any additional us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we do not have plans to repatriate cash in the future and we consider these to be permanently reinvested in the operations of such subsidiaries 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for income taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future tax expense 
absent the availability of net operating losses or tax credits  the possible tax consequences of any foreign cash repatriation could be significant

cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
reduced earnings and changes in normal short term working capital items contributed to the overall reduction in cash from operations during and as compared to the prior years 
our working capital fluctuates significantly due to changes in accounts receivable discussed below  as well as due to the timing of our domestic payroll and accounts payable processing cycles with regard to month end dates and other seasonal factors 
during and  our domestic continuing operations generated million and million  respectively  of cash from operations while our foreign operations generated cash from operations of million and million in and  respectively 
typically  the seasonality of our business in many european countries results in negative cash from operations in the early part of the year with improvements in the second half of the year 
cash flow from european operations are typically maximized in the fourth quarter 
total accounts receivable decreased to million at december   from million at december  accounts receivable declined as slower revenue growth and increased collection efforts during the second half of helped reduce past due accounts  and we were also able to reduce our unbilled receivables related to fixed price contracts through milestone acceptance  billings and collections 
during  our domestic accounts receivable was negatively impacted by the timing of billing milestones on certain larger  fixed price contracts that experienced delays in customer acceptance of applicable milestones  thereby limiting our ability to bill for our services 
at december   our total unbilled accounts receivable for costs and earnings in excess of billings totaled million  which was a decrease of million from the prior year 
total accounts receivable day s sales outstanding dso was days at december   compared to days at december   as the result of improved collections and billings  as well as additional cash received in advance 
in addition  economic conditions and other factors have negatively affected the business conditions of many of our clients  including those in the public sector  resulting in payment delays and  in some cases  increased bad debt expenses for ciber in and our international division typically experiences slower receivable payments during the first half of the year with 
table of contents improvement in the second half of the year  and with their lowest dso levels typically occurring in december 
changes in accounts receivable have a significant impact on our cash flow 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso include contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management  client mix public vs 
private  fluctuations in the level of it product sales and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
many of the individual reasons are outside of our control and  as a result  it is normal for our dso to fluctuate from period to period  affecting our liquidity 
accrued compensation and related liabilities fluctuate from period to period based on a couple of primary factors  including the timing of our normal bi weekly us payroll cycle and the timing of variable compensation payments 
our bonuses are typically accrued throughout the year and paid quarterly or  in the case of annual management bonuses  in the first quarter of the following year  causing some fluctuation from quarter to quarter 
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities typically fluctuate based on when we receive actual vendor invoices and when they are paid 
the largest of such items typically relates to vendor payments for it hardware and software products that we resell and payments to services related subcontractors 
investing activities 
investing activities are primarily comprised of cash paid for acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment 
during  we paid million of additional consideration related to a acquisition 
in  we acquired segmenta a s  located in denmark  for an initial cash payment of million and in  we acquired india based iteamic pvt 
ltd 
for million 
spending on property and equipment was million during  compared with million in and million in generally  our capital spending is primarily for technology equipment and software and to support our global employee base  as well as our management and corporate support infrastructure 
larger capital spending projects typically relate to periodic investments in our client support based infrastructure for our domestic and offshore delivery centers and data center operations  and such investments will fluctuate from period to period 
in  we expanded our delivery center operations in india  which cost approximately million  and we also made other capital investments to begin enhancing our information management systems and to develop management and sales tools 
financing activities 
typically  our most significant financing activities consist of the borrowings and payments under the revolving credit portion of our senior credit facility 
this fluctuates based on cash provided by  or used in  our domestic operations during the period as our us cash receipts and disbursements are linked to the revolving credit facility 
during  we had net payments on our long term debt of million compared to net payments of million and million in and  respectively 
in  we had a cash inflow of million for proceeds from employee stock plans  up from million in both and we did not use cash in to repurchase our own stock  however  in and we used million and million  respectively  for this purpose 
in  we used the cash proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock  as well as the positive cash flow generated by our operating activities and existing cash balances to pay down our long term debt balance 
senior credit facility 
ciber has a senior credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders and bank of america  na as administrative agent the senior credit facility that matures on january  at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility provides for a revolving line of credit of up to million and a term loan with a balance of million at december  under the senior credit agreement  the entirety of the term loan balance was required to be repaid by the company on january  as such  million of our total obligation was classified as a current liability at december  the term loan was repaid on january  
table of contents ciber s remaining obligation under the senior credit facility is classified as long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets 
based on the scheduled maturity date  and absent an amendment  all obligations under the senior credit facility will need to be reclassified to short term debt as of march  as a result  prior to the issuance of our financial statements for the period ending on march   we intend to either amend this facility to provide for an extension of the maturity date  or replace the facility with alternative bank financing or other equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving any of the above mentioned alternatives  or that if available to us  the terms of these alternatives  such as an amended facility  will not be materially less favorable to the company 
on january   we entered into a consent to sell and amendment to the senior credit facility with our lenders that provides for  among other things the consent of the lenders to the sale of substantially all of the assets of the company s federal division  subject to the requirements that  among other things  the net proceeds paid to the company from the sale shall not be less than million and that of the net proceeds paid to the company from the sale in excess of million be applied to the reduction of the revolving line of credit and certain modifications to the financial covenants and related definitions under the senior credit facility agreement with our lenders  for purposes of  among other things  adjusting such covenants to take into account the effects of the sale 
as a result of the closing of the sale of our federal division on march   the borrowings available under the revolving line of credit were reduced by million 
the terms of the senior credit facility  as amended  include  among other provisions  specific limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens  stock repurchases  investments  guarantees  mergers  dispositions and acquisitions  and a prohibition on the payment of any dividends 
the senior credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum ebitda  and an asset coverage test 
we are required to be in compliance with these financial covenants at the end of each calendar quarter 
the summarized covenants are as follows the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio funded debt divided by ebitda may not be greater than to on december   not greater than to on march   and not greater than to on june   september  and december  the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda minus capital expenditures divided by the sum of tax expense  plus interest expense  plus scheduled funded debt payments  plus any restricted payments must be not less than to on december   not less than to on march   and not less than to on june  the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio increases to not less than to on september   and to to on december  capital expenditures for excluded up to million in connection with the expansion of our india facilities 
we must maintain twelve month consolidated ebitda of at least million on december   at least million on march   at least million on june   at least million on september   and at least million on december  under the asset coverage test  the aggregate amount of loans advanced under the senior credit facility shall  at any time  not exceed an amount equal to of all of our net accounts receivable 
certain elements of these ratios are defined below funded debt includes borrowings under our senior credit facility  any other bank debt  as well as any acquisition related liabilities and capitalized lease arrangements 

table of contents ebitda represents the sum of net income or net loss  net interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense  share based compensation expense  and certain other expense items as agreed to by the lenders 
we were in compliance with the above financial covenants at december   with the following calculations for our financial covenant ratios consolidated total leverage ratio to at december  maximum permitted to consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio to at december  minimum permitted to consolidated ebitda million at december  minimum permitted million asset coverage test million not to exceed million the senior credit facility is subject to mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions in amounts equal to the net cash proceeds of any asset disposition  event of loss  extraordinary receipts  issuance or incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of equity  subject in each case as appropriate to thresholds and other exceptions and definitions as specified in the senior credit facility  as amended 
ciber s obligations under the senior credit facility are secured by all of ciber s present and future domestic tangible and intangible assets  as well as a pledge of of the capital stock of ciber s direct foreign subsidiaries 
we may elect interest rates on our senior credit facility borrowings calculated by reference to either the bank of america prime lending rate prime or to a london interbank offered rate libor for one  three or six month maturities  each plus an applicable margin 
at december   the applicable margins for prime and libor loans were and  respectively 
these rates will increase by each on january   and will increase again by an additional on april  the senior credit facility provides for the payment of other specified recurring fees and expenses  including administrative agent fees  commitment fees  and other fees 
at december   our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility was 
based on management s current estimates  we do not currently believe a covenant violation to be probable of occurring for at least the next months 
however  we were in violation of our covenants at june   which required us to seek a waiver from our lenders  and there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with these bank covenants in the future 
if a covenant violation were to occur  although we have been able to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders in the past  we cannot be certain that our lenders would agree to further waivers or amendments 
any such waiver or amendment would come at additional costs to ciber and such costs could be material 
we believe that other sources of credit or financing would be available to us  however  we cannot predict at this time what types of credit or financing would be available in the future  the costs of such credit or financing  or that the terms of any amended or new facility will not be materially less favorable to the company 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any reportable off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments  excluding contractual obligations and commitments of our discontinued operations 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in thousands principal payments on long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating leases other commitments total interest payments were calculated based on the interest rates applicable under our senior credit agreement through the january  maturity date based on the variable rate in effect at december  includes operating leases for all office locations  automobiles and office equipment 
other commitments include  among other things  information technology  software support and maintenance obligations  as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation 
it also includes million of unrecognized tax benefits that we believe will be paid out in the next twelve months as a result of a tax settlement  however  it does not include our remaining unrecognized tax benefits of million because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when a cash settlement  if any  with the appropriate taxing authority may occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience 
we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based on information available to us at the time they are made 
to the extent there are differences between our estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
such differences may be material to our financial statements 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are described below 
revenue recognition ciber earns revenue primarily from providing it services to its clients  and to a much lesser extent  from the sale and resale of it hardware and software products 
ciber s consulting services revenue comes from three primary sources technology integration services where we design  build and implement new or enhanced system applications and related processes  general it consulting services  such as system selection or assessment  feasibility studies  training and staffing  
table of contents and outsourcing and managed it services in which we manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and or systems provided to our customers 
contracts for these services have different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  which requires management to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenue 
fees for these contracts may be in the form of time and materials or fixed price billings 
the majority of our consulting services revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
consulting services revenue also includes project related reimbursable expenses for travel and other out of pocket expenses separately billed to clients 
revenue for technology integration consulting services where we design redesign  build and implement new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for our clients is generally recognized based on the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the percentage of completion based upon the contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs 
if the total cost estimate exceeds revenue  we accrue for the estimated loss immediately 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs  including assumptions as to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in estimated costs 
estimates of total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
revenue for general it consulting services is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees based on time and materials or cost plus  we recognize revenue over the period of performance 
for fixed price contracts  depending on the specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverables  revenue may be recognized on a proportional performance model based on level of effort  as milestones are achieved or when final deliverables have been provided 
outsourcing and managed it services arrangements typically span several years 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from unit priced contracts is recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized on a straight line basis  unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs related to delivering outsourcing and managed services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of labor and other direct costs related to the set up of processes  personnel and systems  which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period services are provided 
amounts billable to the client for transition or set up activities  which do not have standalone value  are also deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period that the managed services are provided 
we sometimes enter into arrangements excluding software license arrangements with customers that purchase multiple services  or a combination of services and it hardware products  from us at the same time  referred to as multiple element arrangements 
each element within a multiple element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided that the delivered services or products have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
we consider a deliverable element to have standalone value if the service or product is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
for our multiple element arrangements  the arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverable elements on the basis of their relative selling price the relative selling price method 
when applying the relative selling price method  the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if it exists  otherwise  third party evidence tpe of selling price is used 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable  then we use our best estimate of the selling price esp for that 
table of contents deliverable when applying the relative selling price method 
since our services are typically customized to each client s specific needs  vsoe and tpe are generally not available 
we determine esp for purposes of allocating the arrangement by considering several external and internal factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  margin objectives  competition  geographies in which we offer our products and services  and internal costs 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional services or products 
other revenue primarily includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  commissions on sales of it products and  to a lesser extent  sales of proprietary software products 
revenue related to the sale of it products is generally recognized when the products are shipped or if applicable  when delivered and installed in accordance with the terms of the sale 
where we are the re marketer of certain it products  commission revenue is recognized when the products are drop shipped from the vendor to the customer 
our commission revenue represents the sales price to the customer less the cost paid to the vendor 
some software license arrangements also include implementation services and or post contract customer support 
in such multi element software arrangements  if the criteria are met  revenue is recognized based on the vsoe of the fair value of each element 
if a software license arrangement containing multiple elements does not qualify for separate accounting for the implementation services  then the software license revenue and the related costs of third party software products are generally recognized together with the software implementation services using the percentage of completion method 
revenue for software post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services performed in advance of billings in accordance with contract terms 
under our typical time and materials billing arrangement  we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  we accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are generally billed the following month 
unbilled accounts receivable also arise when percentage of completion accounting is used and costs plus estimated contract earnings exceed billings 
such amounts are billed at specific milestone dates or at contract completion 
management expects all unbilled accounts receivable to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and are primarily comprised of deferred software support revenue 
goodwill we perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of june each year  or more often if there are indicators of impairment present 
we test each of our reporting units for goodwill impairment 
our reporting units are the same as our operating divisions and reporting segments 
the goodwill impairment test requires a two step process 
the first step consists of comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  then it is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required 
if step one indicates that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then impairment potentially exists and the second step is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
goodwill impairment exists when the estimated implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying value 
we compared the carrying value of each of our reporting units to its estimated fair value at june   our annual assessment date 
we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units based on a weighting of both the income approach and the market approach 
the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit that served as the primary basis for the income approach were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period of five years were estimated using the perpetuity growth method calculation 
the annual average revenue growth rates forecasted for each reporting unit for the first five years of our projections ranged between and  with an overall weighted average of 
we have projected operating profit margin improvement as we expect to obtain margin benefits from a number of internal initiatives 
the 
table of contents terminal value was calculated assuming projected growth rates of after five years  which reflects our estimate of minimum long term growth in it spending 
the income approach valuations also included reporting unit cash flow discount rates  which represented each reporting unit s estimated weighted average cost of capital and ranged from to 
the market approach applied pricing multiples derived from publicly traded companies that are comparable to the respective reporting unit to determine its value 
we utilized enterprise value revenue multiples ranging from to and enterprise value ebitda multiples ranging from to in order to value each of our reporting units under the market approach 
also  the fair value under the market approach included a control premium of 
the control premium was determined based on a review of comparative market transactions 
publicly available information regarding our market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units 
as a result of the first step of our goodwill impairment test as of june   we estimated that the fair values for our international  north america and federal reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by  and  respectively  thus no impairment was indicated 
we also determined that the estimated fair value of our it outsourcing reporting unit was less than its respective carrying amount by  indicating impairment may exist for this division 
because indicators of impairment existed for our it outsourcing reporting unit  we performed the second step of the test to determine the implied fair value of goodwill for that reporting unit 
the estimated implied fair value of goodwill was determined in a consistent manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
as a result  we calculated the estimated fair value of certain non recorded assets  including customer relationships and trade name 
the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities 
the impairment loss for the reporting unit was measured by the amount that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill 
based on this assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of million in  which represented of the goodwill of the it outsourcing reporting unit prior to the impairment charge 
the impairment charge in our it outsourcing division was primarily a result of the decreased operating performance of the division  including a lag in new sales and our inability to achieve operational efficiencies 
we adjusted our forecasted cash flows and the other assumptions used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units to account for our beliefs and expectations of the current business environment 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate based on our view of current business trends  no assurance can be provided that additional impairment charges will not be required in the future 
for the quarter ended september   we reviewed for indicators of impairment and believed that the market decline in the government services industry  which was based on concerns about defense budget cuts and funding uncertainty  warranted an interim test for goodwill impairment in our federal reporting unit 
there were no other events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below carrying amount for any of our other reporting units 
accordingly  we performed the step one goodwill impairment test for our federal reporting unit as of september  we used current estimates of forecasted cash flows  current pricing multiples derived from publicly traded companies that are comparable to the federal reporting unit  and other assumptions to determine fair value 
based on the results of our step one goodwill impairment test  which utilized a consistent methodology as described above  we estimated that the fair value exceeded the carrying amount although by a lesser amount than at june   however  no impairment was indicated and no further analysis was required 
during the quarter ended december   the government services market continued to decline due to further funding uncertainty and downside risk for the sector 
long term federal it 
table of contents spending forecasts decreased significantly in the overall market  and we noted a continued market capitalization decline in the publicly traded companies in our comparable group 
in addition to such factors  we were also required to perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill upon meeting the criteria to classify the federal division as held for sale  as the negotiated sales price was below the carrying value of the related net assets 
we performed step two of the goodwill impairment test as of december   and adjusted the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value  which was based on our estimate of net sales proceeds to result from our january agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of the federal division 
for purposes of the goodwill impairment test  the net assets of the federal division included an estimate for unrecorded customer related intangible assets 
during the quarter ended december   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to write down the federal division s goodwill to estimated fair value  which represents of the goodwill prior to the impairment charge 
we currently have a remaining goodwill balance of million at december  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units for the purpose of our annual or periodic goodwill impairment analysis  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting units  including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying reporting units  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these reporting units 
in addition  we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets  such as cash and property and equipment  to the balance sheet for the reporting units 
we also consider our market capitalization  adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  debt  a control premium and other factors determined by management 
as a result  several factors could result in the impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods  including  but not limited to failure of ciber to reach our internal forecasts could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated fair values of our reporting units  a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization  if we determine that the decline is sustained and is indicative of a reduction in the fair value of any of our reporting units below their carrying values 
adverse changes in our market capitalization  long term forecasts and industry growth rates could result in additional impairment charges being recorded in future periods for goodwill attributed to any of our reporting units 
any future impairment charges would adversely affect our results of operations for those periods 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we are required to estimate income taxes in each jurisdiction where we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as the depreciable life of fixed assets for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent recovery is believed unlikely  we establish a valuation allowance 
changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets impact our income tax expense during the period 
as a result of our cumulative domestic losses  effective april   we recorded a non cash charge of million to provide a valuation allowance for all of our domestic deferred tax assets 
in addition  we haven t recorded any deferred tax benefit for our domestic tax operating losses incurred after april  our cumulative valuation allowance recorded against all of our deferred tax assets 
table of contents at december   was approximately million 
the establishment of a valuation allowance does not impair our ability to use the deferred tax assets  such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  upon achieving sufficient profitability 
as we generate domestic taxable income in future periods  we do not expect to record significant related domestic income tax expense until the valuation allowance is significantly reduced 
as we are able to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets  we will reduce our valuation allowance 
at december   we have federal net operating loss nol and federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
of this total  million of us nol carryforwards are subject to annual usage limitations under us tax rules  however  they do not begin to expire until the remaining nol carryforwards do not begin to expire until our federal tax credit carryforwards are subject to annual usage limits but do not begin to expire until at december   we also have approximately million of foreign nol carryforwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for approximately of the foreign nol carryforwards  as we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize them 
approximately of the foreign nol carryforwards may expire 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 
we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes will affect our overall effective tax rate 
we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities  and sometimes these audits involve proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes  plus interest and possible penalties 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of a tax benefit will not be realized as the result of an audit 
we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the estimates of tax benefits to be realized  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable 
however  final determinations of prior year tax liabilities  either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations  could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions 
the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 
in order to meet the scheduled principal reduction requirements for our term loan that were accelerated in the october amendment to the senior credit facility  we repatriated million of foreign cash to the us in january we have recorded a million deferred tax liability at december   based on our current estimate of the us tax impact from the repatriation 
however  due to our currently available net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards  the repatriation does not have a material tax impact to the company 
the repatriation reduces the available deferred tax benefits available to offset future domestic profits 
except for the million cash repatriation  we have not provided for any additional us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we do not plan to repatriate additional cash  we consider these to be permanently reinvested in the operations of such subsidiaries 
if future events  including material 
table of contents changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for income taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future tax expense 
absent the availability of net operating losses or tax credits  the possible tax consequences of any foreign cash repatriation could be significant 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
at december   we had gross accounts receivable of million and our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of probable losses 
we review our accounts receivable and reassess our estimates of collectability each quarter 
historically  our bad debt expense has been a very small percentage of our total revenue  as most of our revenues are from large  credit worthy global blue chip companies and government agencies 
since  as global economic conditions worsened  and we have taken on certain riskier clients  we have experienced a higher number of client bankruptcies  clients with financial difficulties and clients refusing to pay for services 
our bad debt expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  four clients accounted for of our total bad debt expense 
if our clients financial condition or liquidity were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
such items are very difficult to predict and require significant management judgment 
accrued compensation and certain other accrued liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have several different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary  while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after our results are reported 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
in addition  the process to estimate the fair value of share based compensation also involves various assumptions  inputs and judgments 
we estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience and specific claim activity and actual amounts may vary 
in the ordinary course of business  we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we periodically review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
we use significant judgment in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we expense legal fees as incurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to other market risks is immaterial 
during  approximately  or million of our total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would change total revenue by  or million 
a portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
additionally  we have exposure to changes in foreign currency rates related to short term inter company transactions with our foreign subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made by our 
table of contents foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness under our senior credit facility has a variable interest rate 
at december   our outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility were million  however  we repaid the million term loan balance outstanding on january   leaving a remaining balance of outstanding borrowings under the facility that is subject to interest rate risk of million 
at december   our weighted average interest rate on the remaining outstanding borrowings of million under the senior credit facility  was 
therefore  a increase in interest rates on the remaining million would result in approximately million of additional interest expense
