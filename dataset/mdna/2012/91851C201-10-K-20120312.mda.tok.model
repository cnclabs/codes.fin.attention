item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s results of operations are dependent upon the difference between prices received for its oil and gas production and the costs to find and produce such oil and gas 
oil and gas prices have been and are expected in the future to be volatile and subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors beyond the control of the company 
the company operates the etame  avouma  south tchibala and ebouri fields on behalf of a consortium of five companies offshore of the republic of gabon 
production commenced from the etame field in and was subsequently expanded through additional development wells in  and in  the company developed the avouma and south tchibala fields by setting a platform and tying the field back to the fpso via a pipeline 
oil production commenced from the avouma and south tchibala fields in january oil production began in january from the ebouri field utilizing a platform that was installed in august and connected to the fpso by pipeline 
there were eleven wells on production from the four offshore fields at the end of additional wells are planned to be drilled on the block in in the united states  the company acquired a acre lease net acre in north texas in the granite wash formation in  as well as a acre net acre lease in the granite wash formation in hemphill county  north texas in in addition  the company acquired a  acre  net acre lease in the middle bakken formation in sheridan county  montana  and  acre  net acre lease in the bakken and deeper formations in roosevelt county  montana in production commenced from the first granite wash well on the initial acreage in august in november  the company commenced drilling a second well on the initial granite wash formation lease 
the well landed in the objective reservoir in february subject to successful fracking in march  we expect production to begin soon thereafter 
exploratory drilling on one of the montana properties began in december the company expects to drill additional wells on both montana properties in critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used by the company in reporting its financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting  such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  the company s reported results of operations would be different should it employ an alternative accounting method 
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities the sec prescribes in regulation s x the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in oil and gas producing activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
like many other oil and gas companies  the company has chosen to follow the successful efforts method 
management believes that this method is preferable  as the company has focused on exploration activities wherein there is risk associated with future success and as such earnings are best represented by attachment to the drilling operations of the company 
costs of successful wells  development dry holes and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the life of the related reserves 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical expenses applicable to undeveloped leasehold  leasehold expiration costs and delay rentals are expensed as incurred 
in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting  the company reviews proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its oil and gas properties may not be recoverable 
when it is determined that an oil and gas property s estimated future net cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount  an impairment charge must be 
table of contents recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
this may occur if a field contains lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field 
impairment of unproved property the company evaluates its unproved properties for impairment on a property by property basis 
the majority of the company s unproved property consists of acquisition costs related to its undeveloped acreage both in angola and in the united states 
on at least a quarterly basis  management reviews the unproved property for indicators of impairment based on the company s current exploration plans with consideration given to results of any drilling and seismic activity during the period and known information regarding exploration activity by other companies on adjacent blocks 
see item properties and note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s exploration plans in angola 
in angola  any adverse developments related to the company s ability to further extend the drilling obligation date  if necessary  could result in an impairment of the company s unproved properties and other assets with a carrying value of approximately million 
in the united states  the company recorded an impairment loss of million in  to write down the value of its first granite wash formation well to its estimated fair value 
capital resources and liquidity cash flows net cash provided by operating activities for was million  as compared to million in and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to a million positive variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in compared to and increased non cash charges to net income of million in compared to the increase in cash provided by operating activities in versus was primarily due to net income of million in versus net loss of million in net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to net cash used in investing activities for of million and net cash used in investing activities in of million

in recent history  the company s primary source of capital resources has been from cash flows from operations 
on december   the company had cash balances of million and restricted cash of million 
the company believes that these cash balances combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s capital expenditure budget  which is expected to total approximately 
table of contents million to further develop the etame marin block offshore gabon with a four well drilling program  an exploration well in the mutamba iroru onshore gabon block  completion of the development well in the granite wash formation in texas and four wells on the middle bakken leases in montana 
the company invests cash not required for immediate operational and capital expenditure needs in short term bankers acceptance and money market instruments primarily with jpmorgan chase co 
the company does not invest in the asset backed commercial paper market which has been subject to a liquidity crisis over the last few years 
as operator of the etame  avouma  south tchibala and ebouri fields  the company enters into project related activities on behalf of its working interest partners 
the company generally obtains advances from its partners prior to significant funding commitments 
capital expenditures in  the company invested million in property and equipment additions  primarily associated with million to acquire leases in the united states  million to drill three wells in the united states  and million primarily for offshore platform modifications and production facilities in gabon

additionally  the company s share of the leasehold bonus associated with the etame marin block exploration period extension totaled million 
oil and gas exploration costs as described above  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development costs 
all expenditures related to exploration  with the exception of costs of drilling exploration wells  are charged as an expense when incurred 
the costs of exploration wells are capitalized pending determination of whether commercially producible oil and gas reserves have been discovered 
if the determination is made that a well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities  the well costs are charged as an expense 
in  the company incurred million in exploration expense  including million spent in the united states and canada primarily exploration well costs  million offshore gabon primarily seismic acquisition costs  million onshore gabon seismic reprocessing costs  million in the united kingdom residual exploration well costs  and million in angola exploration well preparation costs

the seismic obligation was met with the acquisition of square kilometers of d seismic in the remaining obligation is the drilling of one exploration well 
as part of securing the second ten year production license with the government of gabon  the company agreed in principle to a cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of the offshore wells  platforms and facilities 
the agreement is not yet signed  but calls for annual funding for the next seven years at of the abandonment estimate and for the last three years of the production license 
the amounts paid will be reimbursed through the cost account and are non refundable to the company 
the funding is expected to begin in after the agreement is finalized 
the abandonment estimate for this purpose is estimated to be approximately million net to the company on an undiscounted basis 
as in prior periods  the obligation for abandonment of the gabon offshore facilities is included in the asset retirement obligation shown on the company s balance sheet 
the company also entered into the second exploration period for the mutamba iroru block which requires the company to reprocess kilometers of d seismic and drill one exploration well by may the seismic reprocessing was largely completed in the company is expected to request an extension period in the first quarter of as the rig to drill the exploration well is not expected to be available until the third quarter of however  the company can provide no assurances that such a request will be granted 
in november  the company signed a production sharing contract for block offshore angola 
the four year primary term with an optional three year extension awards the company exploration rights to million acres offshore central angola 
the company s working interest is 
additionally  the company is required to carry the angolan national oil company  sonangol p p  for of the work program

the company fulfilled its seismic obligation when it acquired  square kilometers of d seismic data at a cost of million million net to the company in january and square kilometers of d seismic data during the fourth quarter of at a cost of million million net to the company 
the government assigned working interest partner was delinquent paying their share of the costs several times in and consequently was placed in a default position 
by a governmental decree dated december   the former partner was removed from the production sharing contract  and a one year time extension was granted for drilling the two exploration commitment wells 
following the decree  the company and the 
table of contents government of angola have been working together to obtain a replacement partner 
options to amend the two well commitment are also being discussed with the angolan government 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the discussions with the angolan government  the company recorded a full allowance of million in against the accounts receivable from partners for the amounts owed to the company above its working interest plus the carried interest 
in early  the angolan government granted a further one year extension for drilling the two exploration commitment wells in accordance with the production sharing contract 
due to the timing uncertainty of obtaining a replacement partner and the outcome of discussions regarding modifying the drilling well commitments required by the production sharing contract  a time extension may be necessary beyond the current expiration date of november  the company can provide no assurances that such an extension will be granted  if necessary 
if the government of angola were to deny a request for a further time extension  the company may be required to impair its leasehold costs and other investments totaling million as of december  the company may also be required to pay the angolan government million in lieu of drilling the two exploration commitment wells

income taxes in  the company incurred million of income taxes  as compared to million incurred in  and million in all income tax expenses were associated with the etame marin block production  and were incurred in gabon 
the higher income tax expense in gabon in is a function of higher sales volumes  significantly higher oil prices  and modest costs incurred  resulting in higher profit oil barrels subject to taxes 
after deducting royalty and cost oil  the remaining barrels are profit oil barrels which bear income tax 
at production rates  the income tax paid on profit oil barrels was 
the slightly lower income taxes incurred in versus was a function of lower sales quantities largely offset by higher crude oil sales prices 
net income loss net income for was million  compared to net income in of million  and net loss in of million 
the decrease in net income in  despite higher sales volumes and average oil prices  was due to higher income taxes and one time charges for bad debt expense and impairment losses
