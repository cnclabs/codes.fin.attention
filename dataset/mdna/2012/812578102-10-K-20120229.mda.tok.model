overview seattle genetics is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of monoclonal antibody based therapies for cancer 
on august   the us food and drug administration  or fda  granted accelerated approval of adcetris tm  or brentuximab vedotin  in two indications the treatment of patients with hodgkin lymphoma after failure of autologous stem cell transplant  or asct  or after failure of at least two prior multi agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not asct candidates  and the treatment of patients with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma  or salcl  after failure of at least one prior multi agent chemotherapy regimen 
there are no data available demonstrating improvement in patient reported outcomes or survival with adcetris 
following accelerated approval of adcetris by the fda  we began to recognize product sales and cost of sales 
adcetris is an antibody drug conjugate  or adc  comprising an anti cd monoclonal antibody attached by a protease cleavable linker to a microtubule disrupting agent  monomethyl auristatin e mmae  utilizing our proprietary technology 
we have a broad development strategy for adcetris evaluating its potential application in earlier lines of therapy in patients with hodgkin lymphoma and salcl and other cd positive malignancies 
in addition  we have three clinical stage adc programs  which consist of sgn  asg me  and asg me  as well as several preclinical product candidates  including sgn cda 
in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with millennium the takeda oncology company  or millennium  to develop and commercialize adcetris 
under this collaboration  seattle genetics has retained commercial rights for adcetris in the united states and its territories and in canada  and millennium has commercial rights in the rest of the world 
in june  millennium s marketing authorization application  or maa  seeking regulatory approval to market adcetris for the treatment of relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed or refractory salcl in the european union was accepted by the european medicines agency  or ema  which is currently reviewing the application 
we also have collaborations for our adc technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including abbott biotechnology ltd  or abbott  bayer pharmaceuticals corporation  or bayer  celldex therapeutics  inc  or celldex  daiichi sankyo co  ltd  or daiichi sankyo  genentech  inc  a member of the roche group  or genentech  glaxosmithkline llc  or gsk  millennium  pfizer  inc  or pfizer  and psma development company llc  a subsidiary of progenics pharmaceuticals inc  or progenics  as well as adc co development agreements with agensys  inc  an affiliate of astellas pharma  inc  or agensys  genmab a s  or genmab  and oxford biotherapeutics ltd  or obt 

table of contents we began commercializing adcetris in august and the commercial potential of and our ability to successfully commercialize adcetris is unknown 
our success in commercializing adcetris will require  among other things  effective sales  marketing  manufacturing  distribution  information systems and pricing strategies  as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the fda granted accelerated approval of adcetris which means that we are  among other things  obligated to conduct specific post approval clinical studies to confirm patient benefit as a condition of that approval 
in addition  we intend to explore the use of adcetris earlier in the treatment of hodgkin lymphoma and salcl and in other cd positive malignancies 
in order to do this  we will be required to conduct additional extensive clinical studies and  if successful  we intend to seek additional regulatory approvals 
these activities will require substantial amounts of capital and may not ultimately prove successful 
further  our other product candidates are in relatively early stages of development 
these product candidates will require significant further development  financial resources and personnel to obtain regulatory approval and develop into commercially viable products  if at all 
accordingly  over the next several years  we expect that we will incur substantial expenses  primarily as a result of activities related to the commercialization and continued development of adcetris 
we will also continue to invest in research  development and manufacturing of our other product candidates 
our commitment of resources to the continuing development  regulatory and commercialization activities for adcetris and the research  continued development and manufacturing of our other product candidates may require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital and our operating expenses will fluctuate as a result of such activities 
in addition  we may incur significant milestone payment obligations as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization 
although we have begun to recognize revenue from adcetris product sales in the united states  we are very early in the product launch and our future adcetris product sales cannot be accurately predicted 
our sales revenue may vary significantly from period to period as the launch progresses 
we also expect that amounts earned from our collaboration agreements will continue to be an important source of our revenues and cash flows 
these revenues will be impacted by future development funding and the achievement of development and clinical milestones by our collaborators under our existing collaboration and license agreements  including  in particular  our adcetris collaboration with millennium  as well as entering into new collaboration and license agreements 
our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and  as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely on them as being indicative of our future performance 
financial summary although we began commercial sales of adcetris in the united states during the third quarter of  our revenues to date have principally come from our collaboration and license agreements 
these revenues reflect the earned amount of upfront technology access fees  milestone payments  reimbursement for support and materials supplied to our collaborators  and development cost sharing under our product collaborations 
total revenues decreased to million in  compared to million in this decrease was due to approximately million of revenue earned in the first half of under our former dacetuzumab collaboration with genentech that ended in june  partially offset by revenue earned from our other collaboration agreements and product sales of adcetris 
total costs and expenses increased to million in  compared to million in this reflects increases in sales and marketing expenses and research and development activities  including clinical development activities to explore additional potential applications of adcetris  as well as our activities to continue developing our adc pipeline programs 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  and million in total stockholders equity 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues 
table of contents and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are comprised of adcetris net product sales and amounts earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements 
revenue recognition is predicated upon persuasive evidence of an agreement existing  delivery of products or services being rendered  amounts payable being fixed or determinable  and collectibility being reasonably assured 
net product sales we sell adcetris through a limited number of pharmaceutical distributors 
health care providers order adcetris through these distributors 
we receive orders from distributors and ship product directly to the health care provider 
distributors are invoiced at wholesale acquisition cost  or wac  and we record product sales upon delivery of the product to the health care provider at which time title and risk of loss pass 
product sales are recorded net of estimated government mandated rebates and chargebacks  distribution fees  product returns and other deductions 
reserves are established for these deductions and actual amounts incurred are offset against applicable reserves 
we reflect these reserves as either a reduction in the related account receivable from the distributor  or as an accrued liability depending on the nature of the sales deduction 
sales reserves are based on management s estimates that consider payer mix in target markets  industry benchmarks and experience to date 
these estimates involve a high degree of judgment and are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary 
government mandated rebates and chargebacks in late september  we entered into a medicaid drug rebate agreement  or mdra  with the centers for medicare medicaid services 
this agreement provides for a rebate to participating states based on covered purchases of adcetris 
medicaid rebates are invoiced to us by participating states 
we estimated medicaid rebates based on a third party study of the payer mix for adcetris and information on utilization by medicaid eligible patients who received assistance through seagen secure prior to completion of our mdra 
in december  we also completed an interim federal supply schedule  or fss  agreement under which certain us government purchasers receive a discount on their purchases of adcetris 
in january  our pharmaceutical pricing agreement  or ppa  with the secretary of health and human services became effective 
the ppa allows certain private entities that qualify for government pricing under the public health services act  or phs  to receive discounts on their qualified purchases of adcetris 
under these agreements  distributors process a chargeback to us for the difference between wac and the discounted price for health care providers entitled to phs discounts or fss pricing 
as a result of our direct ship distribution model  we can identify the entities purchasing adcetris and this information enables us to estimate expected chargebacks for fss and phs purchases based on each entity s eligibility for the fss and phs programs 
we also review actual chargeback information to further refine these estimates 
distribution fees  product returns and other deductions our distributors charge a fee for distribution services that they perform on our behalf 
we are able to calculate the actual amount due for each distributor based on the amount of sales to each distributor and the negotiated fee 
we allow for the return of product that is within days of its expiration date or that is damaged 
we estimated product returns based on historical industry information of return rates for other specialty pharmaceutical products 
in addition  we considered our direct ship distribution model  our belief that product is typically not held in the distribution channel  and the expected rapid use of the product by healthcare providers 
we provide reimbursement and financial assistance to qualifying patients that are underinsured or cannot cover the cost of commercial coinsurance amounts through our patient assistance program  seagen secure 
seagen secure is available to patients in the us and its territories who meet various financial need criteria 
estimated contributions for commercial coinsurance are deducted from gross sales 
these contributions are based on an analysis of expected plan utilization and are adjusted as necessary to reflect our actual experience 

table of contents collaboration and license agreement revenues we use a time based proportional performance model to recognize revenue over our performance obligation period and have adopted asu entitled multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
under this standard  payments received by us are recognized as revenue over the performance period of the collaboration 
collaboration and license agreements are evaluated to determine whether the multiple elements and associated deliverables can be considered separate units of accounting 
to date  the deliverables under our collaboration and license agreements have not qualified as separate units of accounting 
accordingly  all amounts received or due  including any upfront payments  maintenance fees  milestones payments and reimbursement payments  are recognized as revenue over the performance obligation periods of each agreement  which range from two to fourteen years for our current agreements 
thereafter  such amounts received or due will be recognized as revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured 
the assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate point in time  or period of time  that revenue should be recognized 
we believe that the period used in each agreement is a reasonable estimate of the performance obligation period of such agreement 
we did not elect to adopt asu entitled milestone method of revenue recognition which was available as a policy election beginning in the first quarter of our collaboration and license agreements include contractual milestones 
generally  the milestone events contained in our collaboration and license agreements coincide with the progression of the collaborators proprietary product candidates from development  to regulatory approval and then to commercialization and fall into the following categories 
development milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events designation of a product candidate or initiation of pre clinical studies 
our collaborators must undertake significant pre clinical research and studies to make a determination of a product candidate and the time from those studies or designation to initiation of a clinical trial may take several years 
initiation of a phase clinical trial 
generally  phase clinical trials take one to two years to complete 
initiation or completion of a phase clinical trial 
generally  phase clinical trials take one to three years to complete 
initiation or completion of a phase clinical trial 
generally  phase clinical trials take two to six years to complete 
regulatory milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events filing of regulatory applications for marketing approval such as a biologics license application  or bla  in the united states or marketing authorization application in europe 
generally  it takes up to twelve months to prepare and submit regulatory filings 
receiving marketing approval in a major market  such as in the united states  europe or japan 
generally it takes up to three years after a marketing application is submitted to obtain full approval for marketing and pricing from the applicable regulatory agency 
commercialization milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events first commercial sale in a particular market  such as in the united states or europe 
product sales in excess of a pre specified threshold  such as annual sales exceeding billion 
the amount of time to achieve this type of milestone depends on several factors  including  but not limited to  the dollar amount of the threshold  the pricing of the product  market penetration of the product and the rate at which customers begin using the product 

table of contents we have developed a proprietary technology for linking cytotoxic drugs to monoclonal antibodies called antibody drug conjugates  or adcs 
this proprietary technology is the basis of our adc collaborations that we have entered into in the ordinary course of our business with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
under our adc collaboration agreements  we grant our collaborators research and commercial licenses to our technology and provide technology transfer services  technical advice  supplies and services for time periods ranging from two to fourteen years 
our adc collaborators are solely responsible for the development of their product candidates and the achievement of a milestone in any of the categories identified above is based solely on the collaborators efforts 
in the case of our other collaboration and license agreements  such as our adcetris collaboration with millennium or our co development agreement with agensys  our proprietary products or product candidates may be covered by the collaboration or we may be involved in certain development activities  however  the achievement of milestone events under these agreements is based on activities undertaken by the collaborator 
the process of successfully developing a product candidate  having it approved and ultimately commercialized is highly uncertain and the attainment of any milestones is therefore uncertain and difficult to predict 
in addition  since we do not take a substantive role or control the research  development or commercialization of any products generated by our adc collaborators  we are not able to reasonably estimate when  if at all  any milestone payments or royalties may be payable to us by our adc collaborators 
as such  the milestone payments we may receive from our adc collaborators involve a substantial degree of uncertainty and risk that they may never be received 
similarly  even in those collaborations where we may have an active role in the development of the product candidate  such as our adcetris collaboration with millennium  the attainment of a milestone is based on the collaborator s activities and is generally outside our direction and control 
we generally invoice our collaborators on a monthly or quarterly basis for services that we perform or materials that we provide  based on the terms of each agreement 
amounts due  but not billed to a collaborator  if any  are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred revenue arises from amounts received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process and is recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as a current liability 
royalties revenues from royalties on third party sales of licensed technologies are generally recognized in accordance with the contract terms when the royalties can be reliably determined and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  we have not received significant royalty revenues 
investments 
we have investments in a variety of debt securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we classify our investments as available for sale  which are reported at estimated fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than temporary are included in investment income loss  net 
the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility 
additional declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 
we estimate fair values in accordance with a hierarchy prescribed by gaap 
this hierarchy prioritizes the inputs and assumptions used  and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
as described below under liquidity and capital resources we use level inputs to value our investment in auction rate securities 
accrued liabilities 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued liabilities 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
we record these estimates in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated accrued liabilities include fees due to contract research organizations and other costs in conjunction with clinical trials  fees due in conjunction with manufacturing adcetris and our product candidates  third party royalties that accrue on our sales of adcetris and professional service fees  among other items 

table of contents in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual liabilities would differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries  benefits and other headcount related costs of our research and development staff  preclinical activities  clinical trials  lab supplies  pre approval drug manufacturing costs for our product candidates used in research and clinical trials  contract and outside service fees and facilities and overhead expenses 
research and development activities are expensed as incurred 
technology in licensing fees  including milestones and maintenance fees  and other costs to acquire technologies for product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval that are utilized in research and development and that are not expected to have alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and recognize this cost  based on a variety of factors  beginning with the preparation for the clinical trial  continuing through patient accrual into the clinical trial and completion of the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments for clinical trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial  and other costs 
costs associated with activities performed under research and development co development collaborations are reflected in research and development expense 
non refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
share based compensation 
we expense the fair value of share based payment transactions in our consolidated financial statements 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management  including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options 
management also makes decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate used in the model 
fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
we charge this estimated fair value to expense over the vesting period of the arrangement using the graded vesting attribution method 
income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be realized 
we believe that a full valuation allowance is appropriate as we expect to incur operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to pursue the development of adcetris and our product candidates 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  a portion of which would increase income or decrease losses in the period in which such a determination was made 
inventories 
we consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain 
accordingly  we charge manufacturing costs to research and development expense until such time as a product has received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
we began capitalizing adcetris production costs into inventory following its accelerated approval by the fda on august  production costs for our other product candidates continue to be charged to research and development expense 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined on a specific identification basis 
inventory includes the cost of materials  third party contract manufacturing and overhead associated with the production of adcetris 
we would write down inventory cost to net realizable value if we were to determine that we had any excess  obsolete or unsalable inventory 

table of contents on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  accrued expenses  research and development  share based compensation  income taxes and inventories 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
results of operations years ended december   and net product sales we began selling adcetris following its accelerated approval by the fda on august  and net product sales were million in we record product sales net of estimated government mandated rebates and chargebacks  distribution fees  product returns and other deductions 
these are generally referred to as gross to net deductions 
the following table summarizes our gross to net deductions  net of related payments and credits  for the period from fda approval of adcetris through december  in thousands rebates chargebacks distribution fees  product returns and other total balance as of august  provision related to current year sales adjustments for prior period sales payments credits for current year sales payments credits for prior year sales balance as of december  we entered into a mdra in late september and we finalized our interim fss agreement in december our ppa became effective in january the ppa enables healthcare providers eligible under the public heath services act to receive discounts on their covered purchases of adcetris 
as a result  only a portion of our adcetris sales were subject to government rebates and discounts during we expect our deductions from gross sales to increase in as a result of the ppa being finalized and due to the mdra and fss agreement being in effect in future periods 
we expect our net product sales to increase in reflecting a full year of product sales and expected continuing adoption of adcetris by health care providers 
however  due to the recent approval by the fda of adcetris in its two indications and the lack of historical sales data  adcetris sales will be difficult to predict from period to period and as a result  you should not rely on adcetris sales results in any period as being indicative of future performance and sales of adcetris 
collaboration and license agreement revenues collaboration and license agreement revenues reflect amounts earned under product collaborations and adc collaboration and co development agreements 
these revenues reflect the earned portion of payments received by us including technology access and maintenance fees  milestone payments and reimbursement payments for research and development support we provide to our collaborators 
collaboration and license agreement revenues increased by in to million from  and decreased by in to million from collaboration and license agreement revenues during and from genentech were primarily comprised of revenues earned under our dacetuzumab collaboration with genentech that ended in june we continue to have an adc collaboration with genentech 
the increase in collaboration revenues 
table of contents from millennium during and reflect the earned portion of payments received under our adcetris collaboration agreement with millennium entered into in december collaboration and license agreement revenues are summarized by collaborator as follows collaboration and license agreement revenues by collaborator in thousands annual percentage change millennium genentech pfizer  n a n a agensys abbott   n a gsk   n a other total no amount in comparable period 
our revenues are impacted by the term and duration of our collaboration and co development agreements and by progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and reimbursement of materials and support services as our collaborators advance their adc product candidates through the development process 
revenues may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the progress made by our collaborators with their product candidates  the level of support we provide to our collaborators  the timing of milestones achieved  and our ability to enter into additional collaboration and co development agreements 
we expect our collaboration and license agreement revenues to increase in compared to  primarily as a result of our adcetris collaboration with millennium 
we have a significant balance of deferred revenue  representing prior payments from our collaborators that have not yet been recognized as revenue 
this deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in future periods using a time based approach as we fulfill our performance obligations 
product collaboration agreements millennium adcetris and adc collaborations revenues earned under our adcetris and adc collaborations with millennium represented of our collaboration and license agreement revenues in  in and in revenues from millennium increased in and from prior year amounts primarily as a result of amounts earned under the adcetris collaboration 
under this collaboration  we are entitled to receive progress and sales dependent milestone payments based on millennium s achievement of certain events related to adcetris  including approval of adcetris by the ema for which millennium is responsible 
we are also entitled to tiered royalties at percentages starting in the mid teens and escalating to the mid twenties based on net sales of adcetris within millennium s licensed territories  subject to offsets for third party royalties paid by millennium 
total milestone payments to us under the adcetris collaboration could exceed million  of which up to million relate to the achievement of development milestones  up to million relate to the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to million relate to the achievement of commercial milestones 
in  we received a million milestone payment as a result of the acceptance of millennium s maa by the ema 
genentech in january  we entered into an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement with genentech for the development and commercialization of dacetuzumab 
under the terms of the dacetuzumab agreement  we received an upfront payment of million and progress dependent milestone payments of million 

table of contents genentech also funded ongoing research  development and manufacturing costs for dacetuzumab under the collaboration 
in december  genentech provided the requisite six month notice to us of its election to terminate the collaboration effective june as a result  the remaining performance obligation period under the collaboration was shortened to six months 
all deferred revenue  representing payments received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process was fully recognized as revenue using a time based method over the remaining term of the agreement 
during the first half of  we recorded million in collaboration revenue related to this collaboration 
we also have an adc collaboration with genentech  which was unaffected by the termination of the dacetuzumab agreement 
amounts earned under our dacetuzumab and adc collaborations with genentech accounted for  and of our collaboration and license agreement revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
collaboration and co development agreement with agensys in january  we entered into an agreement with agensys to jointly research  develop and commercialize adcs for cancer 
the agreement was expanded and modified in november agensys will conduct preclinical studies aimed at identifying adc product candidates for multiple designated antigens 
we are currently co developing asg me and asg me  and we have the right to exercise a co development option for one additional adc product candidate upon agensys submission of an ind to the fda 
agensys has the right to develop and commercialize the other adc product candidates on its own  subject to paying us fees  milestones  royalties and support fees for research and development services and material provided under the agreement 
either party may opt out of co development and profit sharing in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party 
amounts received for product candidates being developed solely by agensys will be recognized as revenue over the development term of the modified collaboration agreement using a time based approach 
revenues attributable to the agensys agreement increased in from due to two payments made to exercise additional exclusive licenses for adc product candidates and decreased from to due to revenues earned from the expansion of the agreement in adc collaboration agreements we have active collaborations with nine companies to allow them to use our proprietary adc technology with their monoclonal antibodies 
under our adc collaborations  which we enter into in the ordinary course of business  we receive or are entitled to receive upfront cash payments  progress dependent milestones and royalties on net sales of products incorporating our adc technology  as well as annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements 
as of december   our adc collaborations had generated over million  primarily in the form of upfront payments 
total milestone payments to us under our current adc collaborations could exceed billion if all potential product candidates achieved all of the milestone events under all of our current adc collaborations 
of this amount  up to million relate to the achievement of development milestones  up to billion relate to the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to million relate to the achievement of commercial milestones 
our adc collaborators are responsible for development  manufacturing and commercialization of any adc product candidates that result from the collaborations and are solely responsible for the achievement of any of the potential milestones under these collaborations 
since we do not control the research  development or commercialization of any products generated by our adc collaborators  we are not able to reasonably estimate when  if at all  any milestone payments or royalties may be payable by our adc collaborators 
in addition  our current adc collaborations are at early stages of development 
we have not received and do not expect to receive material milestone payments from any of our current adc collaborators unless and until a product that incorporates our adc technology enters late stage clinical development and or receives marketing approval from the fda  if at all 
successfully developing a product candidate  obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing it is a significantly lengthy and highly uncertain process which entails a significant risk of failure 
in addition  business combinations  changes in an adc collaborator s business strategy and financial difficulties or other factors could result in an adc collaborator abandoning or delaying development of its adc 
table of contents product candidates 
as such  the milestone payments we may receive from our adc collaborators involve a substantial degree of risk to achieve and may never be received 
accordingly  we do not expect  and investors should not assume  that we will receive all of the potential milestone payments provided for under our adc collaborations and it is possible that we may never receive any significant milestone payments under our adc collaborations 
pfizer revenues for reflect the earned portion of an million upfront payment and a development milestone achieved by pfizer under our adc collaboration agreement that we entered into in december abbott revenues for reflect the earned portion of an million upfront payment  a development milestone achieved by abbott and reimbursable support we provided to abbott under our adc collaboration agreement that we entered into in march gsk revenues for reflect the earned portion of a million upfront payment and reimbursable support we provided to gsk under our adc collaboration agreement entered into in december cost of sales adcetris cost of sales includes manufacturing costs of product sold  third party royalty costs  amortization of technology license costs and distribution and other costs 
we began capitalizing adcetris manufacturing costs as inventory following the accelerated approval by the fda in its two approved indications on august  the cost of product manufactured prior to fda approval was expensed as research and development expense as incurred and was combined with other research and development expenses 
while we tracked the quantities of individual adcetris product lots  we did not track pre fda approval manufacturing costs in our inventory system and therefore the manufacturing cost of adcetris produced prior to fda approval is not reasonably determinable 
most of the product produced prior to fda approval is expected to be available for us to use commercially 
we expect that our cost of sales as a percentage of sales will increase in future periods as product manufactured prior to fda approval  and therefore fully expensed  is consumed 
this cost benefit is expected to occur during at least the first year of commercial sales of adcetris  however  the time period over which this reduced cost inventory is consumed will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of future adcetris sales  the ultimate use of this inventory in either commercial sales  clinical development or other research activities and the ability to utilize inventory prior to its expiration date 
we expect as this reduced cost inventory is used  the percentage of total costs of sales for sales of adcetris will increase into the teens 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from  and increased to million in from our research and development expenses are summarized as follows research and development in thousands annual percentage change research development and contract manufacturing clinical share based compensation expense total research and development expenses 
table of contents research expenses include  among other things  personnel  occupancy and laboratory expenses and technology access fees associated with the discovery and identification of new monoclonal antibodies and related technologies and the development of novel classes of stable linkers and cell killing drugs for our adc technology 
research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidates  such as preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies 
research expenses remained relatively unchanged from to  and increased from to the increase in was due primarily to technology access fees incurred in development and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and pre approval manufacturing of drug product for use in research and our clinical trials 
development and contract manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities  and storage and shipment services of our product candidates  including adcetris prior to its approval by the fda on august  development and contract manufacturing costs increased to million in from  and to million in from the increase was primarily due to activity related to our sgn cda product candidate while the increase was primarily driven by increased adcetris and lintuzumab manufacturing activities 
following the approval of adcetris in august  the cost of drug manufacturing related activities for adcetris is no longer charged to research and development expense but is capitalized as inventory 
this will result in a decrease in adcetris related manufacturing expense as a component of research and development expenses in development and contract manufacturing expenses also increased in both periods as a result of higher compensation costs related to an increase in staffing levels 
clinical expenses include personnel expenses  travel  occupancy costs and external clinical trial costs including clinical site expenses  clinical research organization charges  contractors and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials  including ind enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies 
clinical costs increased to million in from  and increased to million in from as we expanded the scope of clinical activities for our adcetris program 
in addition  compensation costs increased in both and as a result of increased staffing levels 
share based compensation expense reflects the non cash charge associated with stock options  restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the related arrangement 
share based compensation expense increased to million in from  and to million in from the increases for and were primarily due to a higher average value per share primarily attributable to increases in our stock price 
we utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development projects as well as our discovery and research programs directed towards identifying monoclonal antibodies and new classes of stable linkers and cell killing drugs for our adc program 
we track human resource efforts expended on many of our programs for purposes of billing our collaborators for time incurred at agreed upon rates and for resource planning 
we do not account for actual costs on a project by project basis as it relates to our infrastructure  facility  employee and other indirect costs 
we do  however  separately track significant third party costs including clinical trial costs  manufacturing costs and other contracted service costs on a project by project basis 

table of contents the following table shows expenses incurred for research  contract manufacturing of our product candidates and clinical and regulatory services provided by third parties as well as milestone payments for in licensed technology for each of our product candidates

increased clinical trials costs reflect our clinical trials intended to expand the use of adcetris  including the phase iii aethera clinical trial for post transplant hodgkin lymphoma patients  and preparation for phase iii clinical trials to confirm patient benefit from the use of adcetris which are required as a condition of our accelerated approval 
third party costs for adcetris increased in from  primarily due to expanded manufacturing and clinical trials costs 
increased clinical trials costs reflected our pivotal trial in patients with relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma that was initiated in early  our phase ii clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory salcl  the phase iii aethera clinical trial for post transplant hodgkin lymphoma patients as well as several other clinical trials 
increased manufacturing costs included the costs of resupply of drug product for clinical trials and manufacturing activities in support of our biologics license application submission to the fda for adcetris 
following the approval of adcetris in august  the cost of drug manufacturing related activities for adcetris is no longer charged to research and development expense but is capitalized as inventory 
this will result in a decrease in adcetris related third party manufacturing expense as a component of total third party research and development expenses in third party costs for sgn cda increased by from primarily as a result of higher ind enabling activities incurred in in preparation for planned clinical trials 
in june  we exercised an option under our agreement with agensys to co develop ags me 
in addition to payment of an option fee  we now co fund fifty percent of the development costs of this program 
asg me costs reflect the opt in payment and our share of development costs incurred during the period 
third party costs for asg me increased by in from primarily as a result of the costs of two phase i clinical trials initiated during third party costs for asg me decreased by in from primarily as a result of costs incurred in preparation for the two phase i clinical trials 

table of contents third party costs for sgn decreased by in compared to as a result of lower manufacturing costs 
third party costs for sgn increased by in compared to as a result of the phase i clinical trial that was initiated in late and additional manufacturing costs incurred to support the phase i clinical trial 
other costs and overhead included costs associated with personnel and facilities 
these costs increased by in and in  primarily reflecting an increase in staffing levels in our development and clinical groups from the comparable prior year periods 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization  the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete 
the length of time varies substantially based upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients required in our clinical trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the number and location of sites included in the trials  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the safety and efficacy profile of the product candidate  the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our strategy has included entering into collaborations with third parties 
in these situations  the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate and the estimated completion date are largely under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
we anticipate that our total research and development expenses in will be comparable to due to the approval of adcetris for commercial sale by the fda  the costs associated with manufacturing adcetris will be capitalized as inventory rather than being charged to research and development expenses  resulting in a potential decrease in research and development expenses for adcetris 
this decrease in adcetris manufacturing expense is expected to be offset by increased clinical trial expenses for adcetris related to post approval studies to be conducted as a condition of accelerated approval and additional studies to evaluate other potential uses of adcetris 
certain adcetris development activities  including some clinical studies  will be conducted by millennium  the costs of which will not be reflected in our research and development expenses 
because of these and other factors  expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors  including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in item a risk factors 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product candidate

the increase in was attributable to costs incurred in preparation for the adcetris commercial launch including higher staffing levels and third party consulting activities 
share based compensation expense reflects the non cash charge associated with stock options  restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the related share based payment 
share based compensation expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from and to million in from the increase for both years was attributable to a larger number of optioned shares subject to expense recognition as a result of our increased staffing level and a higher weighted average grant date fair value of share based awards expensed compared to the prior year due to an increase in our stock price

liquidity and capital resources december  selected balance sheet and cashflow data in thousands cash  cash equivalents and investments working capital stockholders equity years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents we have financed the majority of our operations from the issuance of equity securities  amounts received under product development collaborations  including our dacetuzumab collaboration with genentech and our adcetris collaboration with millennium  and amounts received from our adc collaborations 
these financing sources have historically allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and investment securities increased to million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  these increases reflect proceeds from the sale of common stock and amounts generated from product collaborations and adc licensing activities for the years ended december  as follows in millions proceeds from issuance of common stock cash received from product collaborations and adc licensing activities total during  we used million of cash in our operating activities compared to million generated from operating activities in and million used in our working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  we have structured our investment portfolio to provide working capital as needed 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments are held in a variety of instruments and subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in us government and agency securities  corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  auction rate securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
as of december   we held auction rate securities valued at million that have failed at auction and are currently illiquid 
liquidity of these investments is subject to a successful auction process  redemption of the investment  a sale of the security in a secondary market or a negotiated or adjudicated resolution 
each of the securities continues to pay interest according to the stated terms on a monthly basis 
the interest rate on these auction rate securities is no longer established based on an auction process but is established according to the terms of the issue 
as of december   the interest rate of each of the auction rate securities was set at the day london interbank offering rate plus basis points 
we consider the market for these securities to be inactive and distressed 
accordingly  fair value for the auction rate securities has been determined using level inputs  including a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis 
this analysis relies upon certain estimates  including the probability weighted term to an orderly liquidation and the discount rate applied to future cash flows 
the discount rate used in the analysis is based on the observed comparable yield of securities with similar characteristics  adjusted for illiquidity  credit risk and other factors 
in  we recorded an million realized loss related to an other than temporary impairment in the value of our auction rate securities  million of which was reflected as an unrealized loss as of december  this resulted in a new carrying value of million 
we periodically assess our strategy regarding our holdings in auction rate securities based on several factors  including the continued failure of future auctions  failure of the investment to be redeemed  further deterioration of the credit rating of the investment  market risk and other factors 
the loss was recorded in the fourth quarter of resulting from a change in our investment strategy under which we no longer intend to hold these investments until recovery of substantially all of the cost basis of the investments 
our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated working capital needs 
however  if our liquidity needs should be accelerated for any reason in the near term  or investments do not pay at maturity  we may be required to sell investment securities in our portfolio prior to their scheduled maturities  which may result in a loss 
as of december   we had million held in cash reserves or debt securities scheduled to mature within the next twelve months 

table of contents at our currently planned spending rate we believe that our financial resources  together with fees  milestone payments and reimbursements we expect to earn under our existing collaboration and license agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
this expectation does not take into consideration cash expected to be received from sales of adcetris  which we expect will extend the sufficiency of our financial resources 
changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner  such as increased development  manufacturing and clinical trial expenses  including in connection with required post approval studies and additional studies to potentially expand the use of adcetris  and the increases in our sales and marketing expenses in connection with the commercialization of adcetris 
additionally  we may not receive the payments that we currently expect under our existing collaboration agreements  including the adcetris collaboration agreement with millennium  which may shorten the timeframe through which we are able to fund operations 
further  in the event of a termination of the adcetris collaboration agreement with millennium  we would not receive development cost sharing payments  nor would we receive milestone payments or royalties for the development or sales of adcetris in millennium s territories 
any of these factors may lead to a need for us to seek additional capital 
we are required by the fda to conduct additional confirmatory phase iii post approval studies of adcetris as part of our accelerated approval 
these studies will be large studies conducted over a lengthy period of time and although we believe that our financial resources are sufficient to commence these studies  based on the expected length of these studies and the inherent uncertainty of clinical trial costs  we may be required to raise additional capital in order to complete the studies 
for example  the cost of these studies will be dependent on the size  complexity  timing and the progress of these studies  many of which factors are unknown and may change over time 
in this regard  whether we have sufficient funding to complete these studies will be partially dependent upon cash received from sales of adcetris  which may not be sufficient to complete these studies 
our inability to obtain funds sufficient to complete these studies and establish confirmatory evidence of efficacy for adcetris may have material adverse consequences to us  including the loss of marketing approval for adcetris 
these required post approval studies will also significantly increase our clinical trial expenses  which could increase our losses and or negatively impact our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 
we expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees and support our preclinical development  manufacturing and clinical trial activities  including the post approval studies we must conduct for adcetris  as well as position adcetris for potential additional regulatory approvals  and we may therefore need to raise significant amounts of additional capital 
we may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements and public or private debt or equity financings 
we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our development programs  which may adversely affect our business and operations 
we anticipate that our revenues from collaboration and license agreements will be in the range of million to million in and will be generated from fees  milestones and reimbursements earned through our adcetris and adc collaborations 
total research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in are expected to be in the range of million to million 
these expenses will be primarily directed towards commercialization of adcetris  post approval studies required as a condition of accelerated approval and development activities intended to explore potential uses of adcetris in earlier lines of therapy for hodgkin lymphoma and salcl as well as other cd expressing diseases 
research and development expenses will also reflect development and clinical activities for our product candidates  including sgn  asg me  asg me and sgn cda 
development expenses incurred by us under the adcetris collaboration with millennium are charged to expense as incurred 
we and millennium will co fund of the joint development costs incurred under the collaboration 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in compared to as we continue to commercialize adcetris 
expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  the timing of 
table of contents manufacturing campaigns for our product candidates  the number of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial 
included in our operating expense estimate are non cash amounts expected to be in the range of million to million in the aggregate  primarily attributable to share based compensation expense 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions  including future stock prices and the number and timing of share based grants 
commitments the following table reflects our future minimum contractual commitments as of december  in thousands total thereafter operating leases manufacturing  license collaboration agreements tenant improvements total we have entered into leases for our office and laboratory facilities expiring in that contain rate escalations and options for us to extend the leases 
in may  we entered into an operating lease for an approximately  square foot facility to be used for general office purposes 
the lease term began on july  the lease includes an abated rent period and a tenant improvement allowance to be applied toward improvements to the facility 
the lease expires in september with two extension options of five years each 
operating lease obligations in the table above do not assume the exercise by us of any termination or extension options 
a substantial portion of the minimum payments under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements represents contractual obligations related to manufacturing our product candidates for use in our clinical trials and for commercial operations in the case of adcetris 
some of our manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods  as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones 
some of our licensing agreements obligate us to pay a royalty on net sales of products utilizing licensed technology 
such royalties are dependent on future product sales and are not provided for in the table above as they are not estimable 
the above table also excludes up to approximately million in potential future milestone payments to third parties under license and collaboration agreements for adcetris and our current development programs  which generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  clinical  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
milestone payments under these agreements through december  have totaled million 
these contingent payments have not been included in the above table and will not be included until the event triggering such payment or obligation has occurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb completed an accounting standards update entitled asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to converge with international financial reporting standards ifrs and provides increased disclosure about valuation inputs and investment categorization 
we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb completed an accounting standards update entitled asu  comprehensive income  presentation of comprehensive income  which eliminates the option of presenting other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and instead requires companies to present 
table of contents other comprehensive income as either a single statement of comprehensive income combined with net income or as two separate but continuous statements 
we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations but will impact our financial statement presentation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in interest bearing instruments consisting of us government and agency securities  corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  auction rate securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
our investment securities consisted of the following in thousands december  short term investments long term investments other non current assets total short term investments at december  include auction rate securities valued at million that have failed at auction and are currently illiquid 
liquidity of these investments is subject to a successful auction process  redemption of the investment  a sale of the security in a secondary market or a negotiated or adjudicated resolution 
no assurance can be made that further downgrades  losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments will not occur 
if any such further downgrades  losses  or other significant deteriorations occur  it may negatively impact or impair our current portfolio of cash equivalents and investments 
we have estimated the effect on our investment portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates by one percent to be a reduction of million in the fair value of our investments as of december  in addition  a hypothetical decrease of in the effective yield of our investments would reduce our expected investment income by approximately  over the next twelve months based on our investment balance at december  foreign currency risk all of our revenues and the majority of our expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date 
we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended december   primarily related to contract manufacturing and ex us clinical trial activities  and we expect to continue to do so 
our primary exposure is to fluctuations in the euro and british pound 
we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations 
however  transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations internationally 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date 
however  we may do so in the future
