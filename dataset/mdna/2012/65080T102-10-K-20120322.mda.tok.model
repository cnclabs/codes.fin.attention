item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following presents management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
executive overview in  net income climbed to million  compared to million in despite the lingering effects of the deep economic recession that began in  the company has been profitable for nine consecutive quarters 
consistent with the company s strategic and operating plans  asset quality improved  net interest margin increased  core deposits increased  operating expense declined and other sources of non interest income improved and became more diversified 
under the leadership of pressley a 
ridgill  the company s chief executive officer ceo and president  the company did not defer credit costs when it began to experience the effects of the recession in  but instead aggressively charged off and wrote down credits 
as a result of such early recognition  credit costs have now fallen for two consecutive years and are expected to continue to fall if levels of problem and potential problem assets continue to decline  as anticipated 
the net interest margin improved to in  an improvement of more than basis points from the low point in the credit cycle  and annual operating expense has declined by more than million since the company was formed in the july merger of lsb and fnb 
while a number of challenges emerged during the recession  the then newly appointed ceo brought together a management team focused on a north carolina community bank strategy 
the management team members were selected for their talents  experience and commitment to the company s guiding principles  which are founded on the concept that financial success begins with integrity 
by early  the management team was in place  and the credit deterioration in the loan portfolio had peaked 
having implemented a re defined community bank strategy  the company focused on returning to profitability 
under mr 
ridgill s guidance  management s implementation of the redefined community bank strategy has yielded dramatically improved operating results and positive trends  including nine consecutive quarters of profit  including million of full year profit in pre tax income increased million from to and million from to net interest margin increased basis points from in to in  or basis points from in core deposits grew in  in and in core deposits represented of total deposits at year end provision for credit losses declined million in  and million in non performing loans declined in  and from the peak level in june total noninterest expense declined million in and million in since merger  annual operating expense has declined by million total and tier one leverage capital improved to and  respectively  at december  from lows of and  respectively  at september  as we evaluate our results  we are pleased with the robust improvements to date in lowering operating and credit related costs  increasing net interest income and building a stable capital position well above the regulatory levels required to be well capitalized 
between and  the company charged off more than million of loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans  or of the highest peak level of loan balances in june as we have previously discussed  our desire was to put this adverse credit cycle behind us as quickly as possible  through early recognition of credit losses 
we believe we have been largely successful 
table of contents in doing so 
looking forward  we believe credit costs will remain high through  but core earnings should continue to build as problem and potential problem loans decline 
in the recovery period of this recession  we believe the company has emerged more disciplined and efficient with a greater opportunity for long term success than what would have otherwise been realized 
in the coming year  we will look at ways to further reduce problem assets  improve operating efficiencies and reverse the trend of negative loan growth 
the company will also continue to consider opportunities to repay tarp funds and exit the tarp program  although the company is under no compulsion to do so  and will not do so if the terms are not considered favorable to shareholders 
our community bank strategy and operating plan as a community bank  we believe our opportunity to achieve exceptional returns for our shareholders is through consistent delivery of superior customer service to small and medium sized business and retail clients in a manner that the large national and super regional banks are unable or unwilling to emulate 
the piedmont triad has approximately billion of deposits and just of those balances are held at our bank 
the market is dominated by large national and regional banks  with of the market s deposits residing in banks with more than billion of assets 
consequently  even relatively small growth in our market share could potentially result in extraordinary gains for the company 
while deposit balances have been plentiful in the piedmont triad  quality loan opportunities have been insufficient in recent quarters to offset loan portfolio pay downs 
consequently  in  the company opened three loan production offices including one in raleigh  nc 
in the coming year  the company intends to have a lending presence in each of the four largest metropolitan statistical areas msas in nc  including charlotte  raleigh  the piedmont triad and wilmington 
to ensure the long term achievement of our strategic plan  the company s operating plan focuses on basic  measurable operating items that communicate throughout the organization the steps needed to improve the company s financial results 
the operating plan objectives include manage the net interest margin nim and grow net interest income improve asset quality increase non interest income implement a disciplined cost management culture position the company to fulfill its vision and mission 
manage net interest margin net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense and is the bank s primary source of revenue 
in its strategic and operating plans  management identified several steps to increase net interest income and control the net interest margin  including redefining the bank s target market to include the entire state of north carolina 
corresponding with its north carolina focus  during  the company sold its harrisonburg  virginia operations and opened three loan production offices in raleigh  morganton and asheboro  nc 
in  the company intends to open a loan production office in charlotte  nc so establishing a lending presence in each of the four largest financial districts and msas in nc 
reducing the company s dependence on high cost time deposits in favor of lower cost core accounts  including dda  now checking  money market and savings accounts 
establishing a loan pricing committee to better evaluate risk based and relationship pricing to include deposit and other relationships 
management is also seeking to develop more consistency on loan pricing relative to credit characteristics of loans 
redirecting portfolio investments to corporate debt and commercial mortgage backed securities 
maintaining a disciplined and accountable budget process to include monitoring loan  investment and deposit yields  rates and balances so that variances are questioned  and controllable items are examined monthly 

table of contents management implemented many of these operating changes over the last three years  which had a pronounced impact on the company s operating results in and net interest income declined million in to million from million in  following an increase of million from million in net interest margin increased basis points in  rising from in to in  following an basis point increase in from in while the company benefitted from the rise in the net interest margin  loan runoff caused a million decline in the average balance of earning assets 
the decline in earning assets resulted in a million reduction to net interest income  partially offset by the improvement in the net interest margin 
the margin improved due to a continued decline in the cost of funds  attributable to the company s success in attracting additional low cost core deposits 
the weighted average deposit cost fell basis points to for the year ending december  compared to for the year ending december  and for the year ending december  in  the company faced irrational time deposit pricing pressure from financial institutions in market 
the impact caused intense margin compression during late and the first two quarters of as management shifted liability strategies  high cost time deposits left the bank for higher rates elsewhere and were replaced with lower cost core deposit accounts 
now checking accounts became the featured product in marketing ads and internal sales incentives  which resulted in a sizable shift in the deposit mix 
at december   dda  money market  now and savings accounts totaled  or billion of the company s billion of deposits 
the percentage of core deposits has increased significantly  from at december   at december  and at december  improve asset quality our primary objective is to put the adverse effects of the recession behind us as quickly as possible through early recognition of credit losses 
we believe we have been largely successful in identifying and taking appropriate aggressive action with our problem credits 
since  the company has charged off more than million of problem loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans and every meaningful credit metric appears to have peaked and subsequently steadily improved 
nonperforming loans declined  or million  for the year to million at december  since the peak level in june of  nonperforming loans are down or million 
likewise  total classified loans declined  or million  for the year to million and are down  or million  from the peak level at september  at december   real estate acquired in settlement of loans totaled million  up from million at december  during  million of loans were transferred into real estate acquired in settlement of loans  million of write downs were taken  and million was sold 
at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  or of loans held for investment and of nonperforming loans 
provision for credit losses declined million for the year to million compared to million for the year ending december  the company s coverage percentage may not be comparable with other banking institutions due to its practice of charging off specific estimated losses on loans at the time they become measurable 
consequently  the company s allowance for credit losses consists primarily of general reserves  with being general and specific 
management believes that substantially all losses in the company s impaired and non performing loans have been recognized and charged off through the allowance for loan losses 
increase non interest income excluding gains and losses from sales of investments and real estate acquired in settlement of loans  non interest income declined million  from million in to million in the decline in fee income was due primarily to lower retail banking fee income  which declined million  from million in to million in increasing sources of noninterest income was a focal point in the and operating plans  in large part due to the regulatory changes that have targeted the reduction of retail banking fees and income 
wealth management revenue increased  to million for the year ended december   due primarily to growth in trust income  which rose  for the year on higher assets under management 
other noninterest income  including bank owned life insurance boli  increased  over the prior year 
mortgage revenue declined  to million for the year on lower volume in  however  expense cuts in the mortgage division largely offset the lower revenues in 
table of contents implement a disciplined cost management culture core to the execution of management s operating plan is the implementation of a disciplined cost management culture where that which is within our control is controlled 
while certain items such as real estate acquired in settlement of loans and other credit related expenses such as legal  have proven to be outside our control  the vast majority of non interest related expenses are controllable 
a key element to creating this culture was the implementation of a line item accountable budget process 
the budget was built around a philosophy we termed as the cast philosophy  which is an acronym for conservative in forecasts and expectations accountable on an account by account basis specific to each individual in the organization so goals and budgets are understood timely so that continued monitoring and adjustments can be made since the merger  the bank has implemented several major cost reduction initiatives focused on eliminating excess costs and non core or unprofitable activities 
these initiatives include an ongoing franchise validation plan  which carefully reviews each of our branch locations and targets the elimination of waste  inefficiency and duplication throughout our franchise 
management developed a methodology that evaluates each location s pre tax contribution  age and state of the facility  ease of closure  market demographics and overall fit within our strategic vision 
execution of the franchise validation plan and other expense reduction initiatives have resulted in a net reduction of bank locations and full time equivalent employees since merger in in  the validation planning led to the sale of the last remaining virginia location 
at december   the company had full service bank locations and full time equivalent employees 
the reduction in the number of branch locations and other expense reductions resulted in an improvement in our core efficiency from a high of to in since the merger  the company has eliminated million of annual operating expense 
noninterest expense declined million in  from million to million 
personnel expense  furniture and equipment and fdic assessment expense each fell by approximately million in in addition  technology and data processing fell by  real estate acquired in settlement of loans expense increased by  partially offsetting other expense reductions 
as we look into  we anticipate that the established cost management culture will continue to improve the organization s financial performance 
while noninterest expense has declined significantly in recent years  the goal remains to continue to improve efficiencies to a level that surpasses our peers 
that objective has not yet been achieved  but remains a focus through continued discipline 
position the company to fulfill its vision and mission the company is well positioned to serve north carolina  having its headquarters located in the piedmont triad  the state s third largest msa  while also being in close proximity to the largest two msas in north carolina charlotte and raleigh durham  both of which are within a minute drive 
in addition  the company has three branches in the coastal region  which is within the state s fourth largest msa wilmington 
together  the four largest msas represent the focus of future lending opportunities  whereas near term growth in deposits is likely be drawn from the piedmont triad 
in  the company opened loan production offices in raleigh  morganton and asheboro  nc 
an additional loan production office is planned to open in charlotte  nc in capital planning remains paramount in this economic environment 
despite several challenging years following the merger  the company s capital levels have grown and remain well above well capitalized levels  as defined by regulatory guidelines 
at december  the company s total risk based capital was compared to the minimum well capitalized level of and tier i risk based capital was 
banking regulations restrict the amount of deferred income tax assets that may be recognized for purposes of calculating regulatory 
table of contents capital ratios 
at december   million of the company s deferred income tax assets were deducted from regulatory capital 
this amount  which is principally comprised of the future tax benefit associated with net operating loss carry forwards  is the equivalent of of total and tier i risk based capital for the company 
in the event that the company is able to utilize the net operating losses in future periods  some or all of excluded deferred tax assets will qualify to be included in determining regulatory capital ratios  thereby increasing the company s regulatory capital ratios 
the company continues to consider opportunities to repay tarp funds and exit the tarp program  although the company is under no compulsion to do so  and will not do so if the terms are not considered favorable to shareholders 
management has also considered the merits of wholesale disposal of distressed assets 
financial condition at december  and the company s consolidated assets of billion at year end reflect a decrease of from year end  following a decrease of during the previous year 
the decreases in both years were primarily a result of a decline in the company s loan portfolio 
total average assets decreased from billion in  to billion in  while average earning assets decreased  from billion in  to billion in the decreases in total average assets and average earning assets were also primarily the result of a decrease in loans outstanding 
gross loans including loans held for sale decreased million during  or  compared to a decrease of in the decrease in loans is due primarily to the sale of million of loans in connection with the sale of the bank s virginia operation in may  as well as principal repayment on existing loans and loan chargeoffs and foreclosures  coupled with soft loan demand from qualified borrowers 
loans secured by real estate totaled billion in and represented of total loans excluding loans held for sale  compared with at year end within this category  residential real estate loans decreased to million and construction loans decreased to million 
commercial loans totaled million at year end  an increase of from the end of consumer loans decreased during  ending the year at million 
management believes the bank is not dependent on any single customer or group of customers concentrated in a particular industry  the loss of whose deposits or whose insolvency would have a material adverse effect on operations 
investment securities at amortized cost totaled million at year end  a increase from million at year end us government agency securities totaled million  or of the portfolio  at year end  compared to million  or of the portfolio one year earlier

collateralized mortgage obligations cmos totaled million  or of the portfolio at year end  compared to million  or of the portfolio  at the end of the previous year 
the company s investment strategy is to achieve acceptable total returns through investments in securities with varying maturity dates  cash flows and yield characteristics 
us government agency securities are generally purchased for liquidity and collateral purposes  mortgage backed securities are purchased for yield and cash flow purposes  corporate bonds are purchased for yield  and longer maturity municipal bonds are purchased for yield and income tax advantage

the competition for deposits within the bank s market areas increased significantly during the liquidity crisis of as larger national and regional banks increased their rates in an effort to attract deposits and maintain adequate liquidity 
the bank  which historically has relied on appropriate pricing and high quality customer service to retain and increase its retail deposit base  was forced to compete with higher rates offered by the larger 
table of contents national and regional banks in order to satisfy its deposit requirements 
beginning in  the bank shifted its liability strategy  reducing its dependence on high cost time deposits in favor of lower cost core accounts  including dda  now checking  money market and savings accounts 
total deposits decreased million to billion at december   a decrease from a total of billion one year earlier 
this change was primarily the result of a million reduction in time deposits  as the interest rates offered by the bank were reduced substantially during the year 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in money market account deposits 
in may  million of total deposits  which included million of core deposits  were sold as part of the sale of the bank s virginia operations 
the bank s fastforward checking product  introduced in the third quarter of  totaled million at december  in order to attract additional deposits  when necessary the bank uses several different sources such as membership in an electronic deposit gathering network that allows it to post interest rates and attract deposits from across the us bulletin board deposits  brokered certificates of deposit secured through broker dealer partnerships and deposits obtained through the promontory interfinancial network  also known as cdars 
the bank s reliance on these out of market deposits continued to decrease during cdars decreased million  from million at year end to million at year end  while brokered deposits decreased million  from million at year end to million at year end the bank also has a credit facility available with the fhlb of atlanta 
the bank utilized a portion of the approximately million credit line with the fhlb of atlanta to fund earning assets 
fhlb borrowings totaled million at year end in addition to the credit line at the fhlb  the bank has borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank totaling million  and has federal funds lines of million  of which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  management believes these credit lines are a cost effective and prudent alternative to deposit balances  since particular amounts  terms and structures may be selected to meet changing needs 
during the fourth quarter of  the company enhanced its methodology for calculating deferred income taxes related to premises and equipment 
in doing so  management identified an error in the prior methodology used to calculate and record these deferred tax assets  and the related calculation of goodwill  dating back to the merger of its predecessor companies in due to consistent application of this prior methodology  the error was carried forward in subsequent years 
following the writeoff of the company s goodwill in  subsequent financial reporting under reported shareholders equity by  or approximately 
consistent with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 materiality  and sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  management determined that the error did not result in a misstatement of material fact in any period  and has adjusted the company s deferred tax assets and retained earnings for prior years in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investments  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and changes in interest rates earned and paid 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
spread and margin are influenced by the levels and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as by levels of noninterest bearing liabilities

loan approval and review 
when the aggregate outstanding loans to a single borrower or related entities exceed an individual officer s lending authority  the loan request must be considered and approved by an officer with a higher lending limit 
all consumer purpose loan decisions are made by the bank s central underwriting support group 
commercial banking managers cbm can generally approve commercial relationships up to  if the lending request exceeds the cbm s lending limit  the loan must be submitted to and approved by a senior credit officer 
a senior credit officer has authority to approve commercial relationships up to  on a secured basis 
all loan relationships between  and  must be approved by the chief commercial credit officer ccco 
all loans between  and  must be approved by the chief credit officer cco 
loan relationships exceeding  up to  must be unanimously approved by a committee of the ccco  the cco  and the bank s ceo 
loan relationships over  must be approved by the credit management committee of the bank s board of directors 
the bank s loan review program is headed by the loan review manager  who reports directly to the credit management committee of the bank s board of directors 
the program includes the annual loan review coverage plan which is approved by the credit management committee and which stipulates a certain number of loan reviews to be completed by the loan review manager and employees under his or her guidance  and an additional number of loan reviews to be completed by independent loan review consulting firms 
in addition  all loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing their portfolios and making adjustments to the risk ratings as needed 
the watch loan committee  which includes the cco  the ccco  the special assets manager and the special assets officers  reviews all commercial loans graded special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss on a monthly basis  and provides a summary to the credit management committee  also on a monthly basis 
in addition  a committee made up of the special assets manager  special assets officers  senior credit officers and senior lenders reviews all past due loans on a monthly basis and provides a summary to management 
the bank s credit review system supplements its loan rating system  pursuant to which the bank may place a loan on its criticized asset list or may classify a loan in one of various other classification categories 
a specified minimum percentage of loans in each adverse asset classification category  based on the probability of default and on the historical loss experience of the bank in each such category  as well as other environmental factors 
table of contents such as the unemployment level or other economic conditions affecting that type of loan  are used to determine the adequacy of the bank s allowance for credit losses monthly 
these loans are also individually reviewed by the watch loan committee of the bank to determine whether a greater allowance allocation is justified due to the facts and circumstances of a particular adversely classified loan 
the bank s loan portfolio is analyzed on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed monthly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group 
major loan portfolio subgroups include risk graded commercial loans  mortgage loans  home equity loans  retail loans and retail credit lines

see lending activities loan approval and review 
it is the responsibility of each commercial lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan they originate 
credit administration  through the loan review process  validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment 
in addition  as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates  it is the lending officer s responsibility to recommend appropriate changes in the borrower s risk grade 

table of contents currently  the grading process utilized by the bank is segmented by product type 
this methodology does not provide a direct correlation with groupings utilized in the other tables presenting loan information 
the following table summarizes  by internally assigned risk grade  the risk grade for loans for which the bank has assigned a risk grade 
risk profile by internally assigned risk grade in thousands december pass special mention sub standard doubtful total pass special mention sub standard doubtful total commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer other total the bank s loan portfolio consists of loans made for a variety of commercial and consumer purposes 
because commercial loans are made based to a great extent on the bank s assessment of a borrower s income  cash flow  character and ability to repay  such loans are generally viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is the case with residential mortgage loans or consumer loans 
to manage this risk  the bank s commercial loan portfolio is managed under a defined process which includes underwriting standards and risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan grading  ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the bank s credit policies and procedures 
allocation of allowance for credit losses dollars in thousands december amount of total loans amount of total loans amount of total loans amount of total loans amount of total loans commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer other total the allowance for credit losses has been allocated on an approximate basis 
the allocation is not necessarily indicative of future losses 
in general  consumer loans including mortgage and home equity have a lower risk profile than commercial loans 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans are generally larger in size and more complex than consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans are deemed less risky than commercial non real estate and construction loans  because the collateral value of real estate generally maintains its value better than non real estate or construction collateral 
the bank has little or no exposure to subprime lending 
consumer loans  which are smaller in size and more geographically diverse across the bank s entire primary market areas  provide risk diversity across the portfolio 
because mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the consumer s residential real estate  they are the bank s lowest risk profile loan type 
home equity loans are deemed less risky than unsecured consumer loans because home equity loans are secured by first or second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
a centralized decision making process is in place to control the risk of the consumer  home equity and mortgage loan portfolio 
the consumer real estate appraisal process is also centralized relative to appraisal engagement  appraisal review  and appraiser quality assessment 
these processes are detailed in the underwriting guidelines  which cover each retail loan product type from underwriting  servicing  compliance issues and closing procedures 

table of contents management follows a loan review program designed to evaluate the credit risk in its loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  the bank maintains an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss as described below  and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment and historical experience 
special mention these loans have potential weaknesses  which may  if not corrected or reversed  weaken the bank s credit position at some future date 
the loans may not currently show problems due to the borrower s apparent ability to service the debt  but special circumstances surround the loans of which the bank and management should be aware 
this category may also include loans where repayment has not been satisfactory  where constant attention is required to maintain a set repayment schedule  or where terms of a loan agreement have been violated but the borrower still appears to have sufficient financial strength to avoid a lower rating 
it also includes new loans that significantly depart from established loan policy and loans to weak borrowers with a strong guarantor 
substandard these are loans whose full final collectability may not appear to be a matter for serious doubt  but which nevertheless have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and require close supervision by management  such as unprofitable and or undercapitalized businesses  inability to generate sufficient cash flow for debt reduction  deterioration of collateral and special problems arising from the particular condition of an industry 
it also includes workout loans on a liquidation basis when a loss is not expected 
some of these loans are considered impaired 
doubtful these loans have all the weakness inherent in loans graded substandard with the added provision that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and value  highly questionable 
in some instances  the extent of the potential loss is not currently determinable 
most of these loans are considered impaired 
the function of determining the allowance for credit losses is driven by the risk grade system and the loss experience on non risk graded homogeneous types of loans 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in determining the allowance for credit losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings  particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process 
consideration is also given to a review of individual loans  historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral and economic conditions in the bank s market areas 
for loans determined to be impaired  the impairment is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral  less selling and other handling costs  for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
loans are charged off when in the opinion of management  they are deemed to be uncollectible 
recognized losses are charged against the allowance  and subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
management believes the allowance for credit losses of million at december  is adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio  however  assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires continuous evaluation and considerable judgment 
management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events which it believes to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that credit losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting future operating results of the bank

all commercial loans within the portfolio are risk graded among nine risk grades based on management s evaluation of the overall credit quality of the loan  including the payment history  the financial position of the borrower  the underlying collateral value  an internal credit risk assessment and examination results 
as a result  the allowance is adjusted upon any migration of a loan to a higher or lower risk grade within the commercial loan portfolio 
the reserve percentages utilized have been determined by management to be appropriate based on historical loan loss levels and the risk for each corresponding risk grade 

table of contents mortgage  home equity  and credit lines 
reserves are calculated on mortgage  home equity  and credit lines based on historical loss experience 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for each of these loan categories  and is multiplied by the dollar balance of loans in each of these categories to determine the required reserve 
consumer loans 
the consumer loans are pooled together to determine the reserve requirement 
the average rolling eight quarter net loss percentage is calculated for this loan category  and is multiplied by the dollar balance of retail loans to determine a required reserve 
an additional reserve  equal to of all retail loans past due days or more  is added to the above 
specific impairment 
management evaluates significant loans graded substandard  doubtful and loss on an individual basis for impairment 
the specific allowance is calculated based upon a review of these loans and the estimated losses at the balance sheet date 
at december  and  the recorded investment in loans specifically identified and evaluated for impairment was approximately million and million  respectively and the specific allowance for credit losses associated with those loans was approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the amount of specifically impaired loans held by the bank and the associated allowance for credit losses resulted primarily from the bank s decision to take appropriate aggressive action with our problem credits through chargeoffs and foreclosure 
other potential problem loans 
loans graded substandard  doubtful and loss which do not fit the criteria to be considered significant are not evaluated on an individual basis for impairment 
however  the bank closely monitors such loans as a result of their elevated risk profile 
as a result of the bank s discipline  the balance of these other potential problem loans decreased to million at december  from million at december  the loans that make up this category trended as management had projected and reached a peak level in the third quarter of these loans  while exhibiting signs of weakness  continue to perform pursuant to stated terms and conditions and therefore do not have specifically identified expected losses 
approximately of the loans in this category are identified as commercial and industrial or income producing commercial real estate  which management assigns a lower probability of default and or loss given default 
the allowance for credit losses associated with such loans was million at december   which was based on a model that uses probability of default  and expected loss in the event of default  to determine inherent losses within a given group of loans 
provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses totaled million  compared to million in as of december   nonperforming assets totaled million  comprised of million in nonperforming loans and million in real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
those figures compare to million in nonperforming loans and million in real estate acquired in settlement of loans at the end of  totaling million in nonperforming assets 
net chargeoffs decreased in to million  or of average loans outstanding  compared with million  or of average loans outstanding  in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  the company charged off million of a million loan composed of subordinated debt to a financial institution 
in the first quarter of  an additional writedown of million was recorded on this loan 
the bank forgave million of the loan and all unpaid interest and the remaining million was exchanged for preferred stock with a liquidation preference value of million in the institution 
the bank s recorded investment of million is carried in other assets on the company s balance sheet as of december  periodic impairment evaluations are performed and management believes this asset is currently not impaired 
the company does not have any other loans to financial institutions 
at december  and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of year end loans excluding loans held for sale was and  respectively 
the and results have been impacted by the continued weakness in the regional and national economies

table of contents application of critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practice within the banking industry  and are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
the following is a summary of the bank s allowance for credit losses  one of the most complex and judgmental accounting policies of the company 
the allowance for credit losses  which is utilized to absorb actual losses in the loan portfolio  is maintained at a level consistent with management s best estimate of probable credit losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed monthly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology based on a risk grading system that separates non risk grade loans into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group 
major loan portfolio subgroups include risk graded commercial loans  mortgage loans  home equity loans  retail loans and retail credit lines 
management also analyzes the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments may be necessary  if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used 
see additional discussion under asset quality above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk is considered to be the bank s interest rate risk which could potentially have the greatest impact on operating earnings 
the bank is not subject to other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity or equity price risk 
interest rate risk on our balance sheet arises from the maturity mismatch of interest earning assets versus interest bearing liabilities  as well as the potential for maturities to shorten or lengthen our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets  over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the company uses several interest rate risk measurement tools provided by a national asset liability management consultant to help manage this risk 
the bank s asset liability policy provides guidance for acceptable levels of interest rate risk and potential remediations 
management provides the consultant with key assumptions  which are used as inputs into the measurement tools 
following is a summary of two different tools management uses on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
earnings simulation modeling 
net income is affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve and the general market pressures affecting current market interest rates at the time of simulation 
many interest rate indices do not move uniformly  creating certain disunities between them 
for example  the spread between a day  prime based asset and a day  fhlb advance may not be uniform over time 
the earnings simulation model projects changes in net interest income caused by the effect of changes in interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
simulation results are measured as a percentage change in net interest income compared to the static rate or base case scenario 
the model uses the company s current balance sheet  but considers decreases in asset and liability volumes based on prepayment assumptions as well as rate changes 
rate changes are modeled gradually over a month period  referred to as a rate ramp 
the model projects only changes in interest income and expense and does not project changes in non interest income  non interest expense  provision for loan losses or the impact of changing tax rates 
at december   net interest income simulation showed a positive 
change from the base case in a basis point ramped rising rate environment and a positive change from the base case in a basis point ramped declining rate environment 
the projected changes in net interest income are within the asset liability committee s guidelines in a basis point increasing or basis point decreasing interest rate environment 
however  management continually monitors signs of elevated risks and takes certain actions to limit these risks 

table of contents the following table summarizes the results of the company s income simulation model as of december  change in net interest income year year change in market interest rates basis point ramped increase base case no change basis point ramped decrease net portfolio value analysis 
net portfolio value npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any actions management might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
the following is a summary of the results of the report compiled by the company s outside consultant using data and assumptions management provided as of december  estimated change in net portfolio value amount in s percent change in market interest rates basis point increase base case no change basis point decrease the preceding table indicates that  at december   in the event of a basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates  npv would be expected to decrease by million  or 
of the base case scenario value of million 
in the event of a decrease in prevailing market rates of basis points  npv would be expected to decline by million  or of the base case scenario value 
the projected changes in npv are within the asset liability committee s guidelines in a basis point increasing or basis point decreasing interest rate environment 
however  management continually monitors signs of elevated risks and takes certain actions to limit these risks 
interest rate risk management is a part of the bank s overall asset liability management process 
the primary oversight of asset liability management rests with the bank s asset and liability committee  which is comprised of the bank s ceo  chief financial officer cfo and other senior executives 
the committee meets approximately twice per quarter to review the asset liability management activities of the bank and monitor compliance with established policies 
activities of the asset and liability committee are reported to the audit and risk management committee of the company s board of directors 
a primary objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to ensure the stability and quality of the bank s primary earnings component  net interest income 
this process involves monitoring the bank s balance sheet in order to determine the potential impact that changes in the interest rate environment may have on net interest income 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities have interest rates that are subject to change within a specific time period  due to either maturity or to contractual agreements which allow the instruments to reprice prior to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities react to changes in interest rates within a similar time period  thereby minimizing the risk to net interest income

the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between repricing assets and repricing liabilities for a particular time period 
the table  interest sensitivity analysis  indicates a ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within one year at december   to be x 
this ratio indicates that a larger balance of liabilities  compared to assets  could potentially reprice during the upcoming month period 
included in rate sensitive liabilities are certain deposit accounts now  mmi  and savings that are subject to immediate withdrawal and repricing 
these balances are presented in the category that management believes best identifies their actual repricing patterns 
the overall risk to net interest income is also influenced by the bank s level of variable rate loans 
these are loans with a contractual interest rate tied to an interest rate index  such as the prime rate 
a portion of these loans may reprice on multiple occasions during a one year period due to changes in the underlying interest rate index 
approximately of the total loan portfolio at december  had a variable interest rate and reprices in accordance with the underlying rate index subject to terms of individual note agreements
