items management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results and a 
of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are an integrated energy company operating principally in the united states with two major business groups utilities and non regulated energy 
we report our business groups in the following financial segments business group financial segment utilities electric utilities gas utilities non regulated energy oil and gas power generation coal mining in january  we entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell enserco  our energy marketing segment  which resulted in the reporting of this segment as discontinued operations 
the sale transaction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of our utilities group consists of our electric and gas utilities segments 
our electric utilities segment generates  transmits and distributes electricity to approximately  customers in south dakota  wyoming  colorado and montana and includes the operations of cheyenne light and its approximately  gas utility customers in wyoming 
our gas utilities segment serves approximately  natural gas customers in colorado  iowa  kansas and nebraska 
our non regulated energy group engages in the production of natural gas  crude oil and coal  and the production of electric power through ownership of a portfolio of generating plants  the output energy and capacity of which is sold primarily under mid and long term wholesale contracts 
industry overview the global economic crisis that commenced in late and continued through has reduced energy demand 
energy commodity prices  which were near historic highs in mid  experienced dramatic declines in early while crude oil prices recovered notably from through  natural gas prices have continued to decline 
domestic crude oil prices continued to be influenced by global factors  including foreign economic conditions especially in china and asia  the policies of opec and other large foreign oil producers  and political tensions and conflict in many regions 
the proliferation of domestic natural gas shale plays in recent years has provided the market an abundant new supply of natural gas 
combined with lower demand from the economic downturn  this new and abundant supply source has created record volumes of natural gas in storage  and reduced domestic natural gas prices 
in fact  the ratio of crude oil to natural gas prices is at an all time high  far in excess of the six to one heating value equivalent ratio 
this trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future given the expected further development of domestic shale gas reserves 
coal prices for both western and eastern markets continued to experience volatility in with multiple micro and macro influences impacting prices 
nymex capp btu per pound prices began the year at over  but finished the year around 
conversely  powder river basin btu per pound spot prices started the year at  then increased to more than at the beginning of the summer  but ultimately settled back to in late like other united states industries  the energy industry is faced with numerous uncertainties  both short and long term 
many utilities have large capital spending needs over the next few years to replace aging infrastructure  add new assets such as transmission lines and renewable energy resources  and replace power generation facilities due to increasingly stringent state and federal emissions regulations 
utility companies generally are less impacted by economic downturns  but the severe recession and prolonged recovery affected demand for energy and the ability of customers to pay their utility bills  particularly in certain parts of the country 
in and  the united states economy appears to have initiated a slow recovery from the deep recession 
for credit worthy companies  equity and debt financings were successfully undertaken throughout and the state utility regulatory climate in remained relatively constructive among government  industry and consumer representatives 
in the seven state region encompassing our utility operations  regulators were willing to establish rates based on multi year considerations  including fuel and other reasonable cost adjustments  justifiable capital expenditures for maintenance and expansion of energy systems  and a response to environmental concerns through demand management and energy efficiency programs 
challenges remain  however  in obtaining satisfactory rate recovery for utility investments due to the general state of the economy and concern by regulators in various states that utility rate increases may cause further harm to local economies 
recent federal administrative and legislative actions have set the stage for an emphasis on increased regulation and government oversight of the energy industry 
the energy marketplace and the company continue to respond to the increased oversight and enforcement activity of ferc  and increased environmental and emissions reviews and mandates 
the epa passed rules in that will likely either require expensive upgrades or the closure of many older coal burning power plants 
state legislatures also remained active on environmental issues in and  with a majority of states now having adopted some form of renewable energy standard  including some in which we operate 
in addition  several states have passed greenhouse gas emissions legislation  which places limits on the emissions of co and other greenhouse gases 
these known and potential future administrative and legislative actions could have significant macroeconomic consequences  which may impact us  as the associated cost increases may cause a dramatic increase in consumer costs for products and services  including rates for electricity and other energy in the mid to long term 
the november elections caused a significant change in the domestic political environment  and a dramatic shift in domestic policy 
the passage of the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of  extends through lower tax rates introduced in and  reduces the estate tax  extends unemployment benefits  reduces the social security portion of payroll taxes for employees  and extends bonus depreciation 
a benefit to our investors  the bill extends through the lower capital gains tax rate introduced by the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of additionally  the bill extends the bonus depreciation for business property acquired after september  and placed into service prior to january  this provision provided positive tax benefits for the colorado electric and colorado ipp generation projects completed in over the last decade  the corporate structure of many energy companies underwent evaluation and change  in large part due to efforts to create additional shareholder value 
since before the economic crisis  a number of companies contemplated or implemented a realignment of business lines  reflecting a shift in long term strategies 
some divested certain energy properties to focus on core businesses  such as exiting non regulated power production or energy marketing  in favor of more stable utility operations 
others engaged in mergers and acquisitions with a goal to improve economies of scale and returns to investors 
while mergers and acquisition activity in the utility industry essentially stopped in and  several transactions were announced in late  throughout and early which may signal a resumption of utility transactions 
private equity investors continued to play a role in the changing composition of energy ownership 
many industry analysts cite the need for expanded energy capacity and delivery systems 
they continue to foresee an increase in capital investment across a wide spectrum of energy companies 
many electric and gas utilities must replace aging plant and equipment  and regulators appear willing to provide acceptable rate treatment for additional utility investment  although the current state of the economy makes rate recovery more challenging in the short run 
if warranted based on commodity prices  oil and gas producers will continue to explore for new reserves  particularly natural gas  which will be the primary fuel of choice in light of concern regarding ghg emissions and the need to provide backup generation for renewable energy resources 
the growing focus on environmental regulation made it increasingly more difficult to obtain drilling permits  particularly on federal and native american lands 
however  current low natural gas prices prompted some companies to curtail projects in order to conserve cash during a period of low cash flow and constrained capital markets 
fossil fuel combustion continues to be a contentious domestic and international public policy issue  as many nations  including united states allies  advocate reductions in co and other emissions 
many states now encourage the energy industry to invest in renewable energy resources  such as wind or solar power  or the use of bio mass as a fuel 
in many instances  renewable energy use is mandated by state regulators 
several years ago  the state of california mandated that future imports of power must come from power plants with emission levels no greater than combined cycle natural gas fired plants 
such restrictions may alter transmission flow of power in western states  as a large percentage of current power generation in the western grid comes from coal sources 
the power generation industry continues to make improvements in emissions control  both voluntarily and in response to regulatory mandates 
emissions from new coal fired plants are now a small fraction of those produced by power plants built a generation ago 
with similar technological progress  coal can and likely will remain an important  domestically available  and economical national energy resource that is vital to meet growing energy demand 
in that regard  the doe is beginning to take positive steps toward ensuring the future of coal through research funding for clean coal technologies and methods of carbon capture and sequestration 
energy providers  government authorities and private interests continue to address issues concerning electric transmission  power generation capacity  the use of renewable and other diversified sources of energy  crude oil and natural gas pipelines and storage  and other infrastructure requirements 
in the short term  prevailing economic conditions will reduce industrial and retail energy consumption 
despite public and private efforts to promote conservation and efficiency  however  the demand for energy is expected to increase steadily over the long term 
to meet this demand growth  the industry will need to provide capital  resources and innovation to serve customers cost effectively  and to achieve suitable returns on investment 
we believe that we are well positioned in this industry setting  and able to proceed with our key business objectives 
along with industry counterparts  we are preparing to address the challenges discussed in this overview  such as new environmental regulations and mandates  renewable portfolio standards  co related taxes or trading practices  credit market conditions  inflation  or other factors that may affect energy demand and supply 
in particular  we are sensitive to additional costs that can negatively affect our customers or our profitability 
to that end  we intend to work closely with regulators and industry leaders to assure that cost conscious proposals and solutions are carefully explored in public policy proceedings 
business strategy we are a customer focused integrated energy company 
our business is comprised of electric and natural gas utilities  power generation assets  and fuel assets which produce crude oil  natural gas and coal 
our focus on customers whether they are utility customers or non regulated generation provides opportunities to expand our businesses by constructing additional rate base assets to serve our utility customers and expand our non regulated energy holdings to provide additional products and services to our wholesale customers 
the diversity of our energy operations reduces reliance on any single business segment to achieve our strategic objectives 
our emphasis on our utility businesses with diverse geographic and fuel mix  combined with a conservative approach to our non regulated energy operations mitigates our overall corporate risk and enhances our ability to earn stronger returns for shareholders over the long term 
despite challenging conditions in the capital markets over the past few years  we have demonstrated our ability to access the debt and equity markets  resulting in sufficient liquidity and solid cash flows 
consequently  our financial foundation is sound and capable of supporting an expansion of operations in both the near and long term 
our long term strategy focuses on growing both our utility and non regulated energy businesses  primarily by increasing our customer base and providing superior service to both utility and non regulated energy customers 
in our natural gas and electric utilities  we intend to significantly grow our asset base to serve projected customer demand and to comply with environmental mandates in our existing utility service territories through expansion of infrastructure and construction of new rate based power generation facilities 
if the opportunity arises  we will pursue acquisitions of additional utility properties  primarily in the great plains and rocky mountain regions of the country 
by maintaining our high customer service and reliability standards in a cost efficient manner  our goal is to secure appropriate rate recovery to provide solid economic returns on our utility investments 
we will continue to prudently grow and develop our existing inventory of crude oil and natural gas reserves  while we strive to maintain strong relationships with mineral owners  landowners and regulatory authorities 
we intend to focus our near term efforts on proving up the substantial shale gas potential of our san juan and piceance basin properties  while continuing our participation in the bakken oil shale play and other oil related exploration opportunities 
given increased regulatory emphasis on wind and solar power generation  and potential environmental regulations and legislation that may limit construction of new coal fired power plants  we believe that natural gas will be the near term fuel of choice for power generation 
additional gas fired peaking resources will also be required to provide critical back up supplies for renewable technologies 
nearly of all electricity generated in the united states is currently supplied from coal fired power plants 
it will take decades and significant expense before this generation can be replaced with alternative technologies 
as a result  coal fired resources will remain a necessary component of the nation s electric supply for the foreseeable future 
the current regulatory climate  combined with potential greenhouse gas legislation  will likely limit construction of new conventional coal fired power plants  but technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration should provide for the long term economic use of coal 
we are investigating the possible deployment of these technologies at our mine site in wyoming and will continue efforts to develop additional markets for our coal production  including the development of additional power plants at our mine site 
we have expertise in permitting  constructing and operating power generation facilities 
these skills  combined with our understanding of electric resource planning and regulatory procedures  provide a significant opportunity for us to add long term shareholder value 
we intend to grow our non regulated power generation business by continuing to focus on long term contractual relationships with other load serving utilities 
in january  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell enserco  our non regulated energy marketing segment 
this strategic divestiture should reduce our risk profile  improve our credit metrics and enhance our ability to produce more stable cash flows and earnings for our shareholders 
with the completion of this transaction  we will strengthen the focus on our utilities  power generation and fuel production businesses 
the proceeds from this divestiture will reduce our equity financing needs for planned growth projects 
key elements of our business strategy provide stable long term rates for customers and increase earnings by efficiently planning  constructing and operating rate base power generation facilities needed to serve our electric utilities 
our company began as a vertically integrated electric utility  and this business model remains a core strength and strategy today  as we invest in and operate efficient power generation resources to cost effectively transmit and distribute electricity to our customers 
we provide power at reasonable rates to our customers  and earn competitive returns for our investors 
rate base generation assets offer several advantages for consumers  regulators and investors 
first  since the generating assets are included in the utility rate base and reviewed and approved by government authorities  customer rates are more stable than if the power was purchased from the open market through wholesale contracts that are renegotiated over time 
second  regulators participate in a planning process where long term investments are designed to match long term energy demand 
third  investors are assured that a long term  reasonable  stable rate of return may be earned on their investment 
a lower risk profile may also improve credit ratings which  in turn  can benefit both consumers and investors by lowering our cost of capital 
examples of our progress include the january completion of wygen ii to serve the customers of cheyenne light  the april completion of wygen iii to serve the customers of black hills power  and the january  completion of a mw gas fired power plant to serve the customers of colorado electric 
existing legislation in colorado will require the retirement of colorado electric s wn clark plant by december  additionally  epa regulations covering hazardous air pollutants may necessitate the early retirement of several of our older coal fired power plants  including black hills power s osage  ben french and neil simpson i plants 
we have recommended replacing these facilities with rate based natural gas fired power plants to be located in cheyenne  wy 
for customers in states without renewable or co mandates  such as south dakota and wyoming  we have constructed mine mouth state of the art  cost efficient  coal fired facilities  such as wygen ii and wygen iii 
given the current environmental regulatory climate  it is unlikely we could secure a permit to construct additional coal fired generation in the next several years  but we are actively evaluating alternative coal fired generation technologies  including igcc and carbon capture and sequestration  though both appear cost prohibitive in the near term 
these technologies may become cost effective in the future if regulatory or legislative actions place a sufficiently high price on co 

emissions or further technological advancements reduce the costs of those technologies 
the location of our coal mine and power plant complex in the powder river basin of wyoming provides key strategic advantages for carbon capture and sequestration projects  such as readily available saline aquifers for the injection and sequestration of co  as well as a potential co 

market for use in enhanced oil recovery projects 
additionally  the wyoming legislature has been proactive in passing legislation to address pore space ownership  injection regulations and other legal issues associated with the underground sequestration of co proactively integrate alternative and renewable energy into our utility energy supply while mitigating and remaining mindful of customer rate impacts 
the energy and utility industries face tremendous uncertainty related to the potential impact of legislation and regulation intended to reduce ghg emissions and increase the use of renewable and other alternative energy sources 
to date  many states have enacted and others are considering some form of mandatory renewable energy standard  requiring utilities to meet certain thresholds of renewable energy use 
additionally  many states have either enacted or are considering legislation setting ghg emissions reduction targets 
federal legislation for both renewable energy standards and ghg emission reductions is also under consideration 
mandates for the use of renewable energy or the reduction of ghg emissions will likely produce substantial increases in the prices for electricity and natural gas 
at the same time  however  as a regulated utility we are responsible for providing safe  reasonably priced  reliable sources of energy to our customers 
as a result  we have developed a customer centered strategy for complying with renewable energy standards and ghg emission reductions that balances our customers rate concerns with environmental considerations and administrative and legislative mandates 
we attempt to strike this balance by prudently and proactively incorporating renewable energy into our resource supply  while seeking to minimize the magnitude and frequency of rate increases for our utility customers 
examples of our balanced approach include in states such as south dakota and wyoming that currently have no legislative mandate on the use of renewable energy  we have proactively integrated cost effective renewable energy into our generation supply based upon our expectation that there will be mandatory renewable energy standards in the future 
for example  under two year ppas we purchase a total of mw of wind energy from wind farms located near cheyenne  wyoming for use at black hills power and cheyenne light  colorado and montana have legislative mandates regarding the use of renewable energy 
therefore  we aggressively pursue cost effective initiatives with the regulators that will allow us to meet our renewable energy requirements 
to the extent practical  we intend to construct renewable generation resources as rate base assets  which will help mitigate the long term customer rate impact of adding renewable energy supplies 
for example  the cpuc approved a mw wind turbine project in which we are permitted to rate base ownership as part of our plan to meet colorado s renewable energy standard expected to be completed by the end of  and in all states in which we conduct electric utility operations  we are exploring other potential biomass  solar and wind energy projects  particularly wind generation sites located near our utility service territories 
expand utility operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages 
for more than years we have provided reliable utility services  delivering quality and value to our customers 
our tradition of accomplishment supports efforts to expand our utility operations into other markets  most likely in areas that permit us to take advantage of our intrinsic competitive advantages  such as baseload power generation  system reliability  superior customer service  community involvement and a relationship based approach to regulatory matters 
the acquisition of cheyenne light and the aquila transaction are examples of such expansion efforts 
utility operations also enhance other important business development opportunities  including gas transmission pipelines and storage infrastructure  which could promote other non regulated energy operations 
utility operations can contribute substantially to the stability of our long term cash flows  earnings and dividend policy 
we have a platform of systems and processes which are very scalable  which would simplify the integration of potential future utility acquisitions 
merger and acquisition activity in the utility industry has increased in the last year 
we believe that impacts of the current recession may produce opportunities for healthy utility companies to acquire utility assets and operations of companies on attractive terms and conditions 
we would expect to consider such opportunities if we believe they would further our long term strategy and help maximize shareholder value 
build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers of both our utilities and non regulated power generation business 
we strive to build strong relationships with other utilities  municipalities and wholesale customers and believe we will continue to be a primary provider of electricity to wholesale utility customers 
we further believe that these entities will continue to need products  such as capacity  in order to reliably serve their customers 
by providing these products under long term contracts  we are able to help our customers meet their energy needs 
through this approach  we also believe we can earn more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling energy into more volatile spot markets 
in addition  relationships that we ve established with wholesale power customers have developed into other opportunities 
mean and mdu  both wholesale power customers  are now also joint owners in two of our power plants  wygen i and wygen iii  respectively 
selectively grow our non regulated power generation business in targeted regional markets by developing assets and selling most of the capacity and energy production through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities 
while much of our recent power plant development has been for our regulated utilities  we intend to continue to expand our non regulated power generation business by developing and operating power plants in regional markets based on prevailing supply and demand fundamentals in a manner that complements our existing fuel assets and marketing capabilities 
we intend to grow this business through a combination of the development of new power generation facilities and disciplined acquisitions primarily in the western region where our detailed knowledge of market and electric transmission fundamentals provides us a competitive advantage  and  consequently increases our ability to earn attractive returns 
we expect to prioritize small scale facilities that serve incremental growth or provide critical back up to renewable resources  and are typically easier to permit and construct than large scale generation projects 
most of the energy and capacity from our non regulated power facilities is sold under mid and long term contracts 
when possible  we structure long term contracts as tolling arrangements  whereby the contract counterparty assumes the fuel risk 
going forward  we will continue to focus on selling a majority of our non regulated capacity and energy primarily to load serving utilities under long term agreements that have been reviewed or approved by state utility commissions 
an example of this strategy is the mw of combined cycle gas fired generation recently constructed by our non regulated power generation subsidiary to serve our colorado electric utility subsidiary 
the plant commenced operations on january   under a year tolling agreement 
with respect to our current power sale agreements  two of our long term power contracts provide for the sale of capacity and energy to cheyenne light from our gillette ct and wygen i plants 
the gillette ct contract was extended in through the wygen i contract extended during now expires in  and provides an option for cheyenne light to purchase and rate base a portion of wygen i 
apply our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce and sell power at attractive margins 
we expect to selectively expand our portfolio of power plants which have relatively low marginal costs of producing energy and related products and services 
we intend to utilize a competitive power production strategy  together with access to coal and natural gas reserves  to be competitive as a power generator 
competitive production costs can result from a variety of factors  including low fuel costs  efficiency in converting fuel into energy  and low per unit operation and maintenance costs 
in addition  we typically operate our plants with high levels of availability  as compared to industry benchmarks 
we aggressively manage each of these factors with the goal of achieving low production costs 
one of our primary competitive advantages is our wrdc coal mine  which is located in reasonably close proximity to our electric utility service territories 
we leverage this competitive advantage by building state of the art mine mouth coal fired generating capacity  allowing us to substantially eliminate fuel transportation and storage costs 
this strengthens our position as a low cost producer because transportation costs often represent the largest component of the delivered cost of coal for many other utilities 
increase the value of our oil and gas properties by prudently growing our reserves and increasing our production of natural gas and crude oil 
our strategy is to cost effectively grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil through both organic growth and acquisitions 
while consistent growth remains our objective  we realize the necessity of managing for value creation over managing for growth as follows through detailed reservoir analysis  apply proven technologies to our existing assets to maximize value  participate in a limited number of selective and meaningful exploration prospects  primarily focus on the rocky mountain region  where we can more easily integrate new opportunities with our existing crude oil and natural gas operations as well as our power generation activities 
specifically  we intend to focus our near term efforts on fully developing the substantial shale gas potential of our san juan and piceance basin properties  continuing our participation in the bakken oil shale play and participating in select oil exploration prospects with substantial upside opportunities  support the future capital requirements of our drilling program by stabilizing cash flows with a hedging program that mitigates commodity price risk for a portion of our established production for up to two years in the future  and enhance our crude oil and natural gas production activities with the construction or acquisition of mid stream gathering  compression and treating facilities in a manner that maximizes the economic value of our operations 
diligently manage the credit  price and operational risks inherent in buying and selling energy commodities 
all of our operations require effective management of counterparty credit risk 
we mitigate this risk by conducting business with a diverse group of creditworthy counterparties 
in certain cases where creditworthiness merits security  we require prepayment  secured letters of credit or other forms of financial collateral 
we establish counterparty credit limits and employ continuous credit monitoring  with regular review of compliance under our credit policy by our executive credit committee 
our oil and gas and power generation operations require effective management of price and operational risks related to adverse changes in commodity prices and the volatility and liquidity of the commodity markets 
to mitigate these risks  we implemented risk management policies and procedures 
our oversight committees monitor compliance with these policies 
maintain an investment grade credit rating and ready access to debt and equity capital markets 
access to capital has been and will continue to be critical to our success 
we will require access to the capital markets to fund our planned capital investments or  when possible  to make strategic acquisitions that prudently grow our businesses 
our access to adequate and cost effective financing depends upon our ability to maintain our investment grade issuer credit rating 
disruption in worldwide capital markets over the past few years has reduced liquidity in the debt capital markets and caused significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk  and the failure of certain financial institutions 
despite actions of the united states and foreign governments  these events contributed to a general economic decline that materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets  and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital 
completion of the planned divestiture of enserco  our energy marketing segment  will improve our credit metrics and reduce our overall risk profile 
notwithstanding these adverse capital market conditions  we have completed several key financings during the period  including a net million equity offering  a million senior unsecured corporate bond offering  a million one year term loan which was subsequently negotiated to two year term  and a million one year term loan 
prospective information we expect to generate long term growth through the expansion of integrated and diverse energy operations 
we recognize that sustained growth requires continued capital deployment 
our diversified energy portfolio with an emphasis on regulated utilities provides growth opportunities  yet avoids concentrating business risk 
we expect much of our growth in the next few years will come from major capital investments at our existing segments 
during  we were able to complete debt arrangements on favorable terms and in november settled the equity forward agreement initiated in we are confident in our ability to obtain additional financing to continue our growth plans 
we remain focused on managing our operations cautiously and maintaining our overall liquidity to meet our operating  capital and financing needs  as well as execute our long term strategic plan 
utilities group electric utilities our electric utilities benefited from an increase in rates resulting from rate cases approved during and will benefit from a colorado electric rate case approval of million in annual revenues which was effective january  upon commercial operation of a mw gas fired generation facility that now serves colorado electric customers 
we believe that the addition of this plant to our utility rate base and the successful approval of our rate case will have a significant positive impact on our future financial results 
as part of this rate case  the percentage of gross margin to be shared with customers for off system sales at colorado electric was settled providing colorado electric of that gross margin  less certain operating costs  through and thereafter 
additionally  on december   cheyenne light filed requests for electric and natural gas revenue increases of million with the wpsc to recover investment in infrastructure and other costs 
pursuant to prior approved resource plans  the electric utilities engaged in the following regulatory requests or construction activities during cheyenne light and black hill power filed a joint cpcn requesting approval to construct a new mw generating facility  colorado electric completed construction of a mw generating facility  which was placed into commercial operation on january  although cpuc issued an order approving the retirement of our wn clark coal fired generation facility in order to comply with the colorado clean air clean jobs act for colorado electric  the cpuc has not yet approved plans proposed to replace the facility  and the cpuc approved construction of a mw wind farm  of which colorado electric will own  as part of our plan to meet colorado s renewable energy standards and colorado electric expects to file an energy resource plan to address additional renewable energy required to comply with colorado s renewable energy standards in the second quarter of the expiration and replacement of the psco ppa with colorado electric required additional capacity and energy needs of approximately mw 
the remaining capacity and energy needed was acquired through a competitive bidding process including other power producers 
our power generation segment was awarded the bid to provide mw of capacity and energy to colorado electric through a year ppa 
the generating facilities commenced providing energy under this ppa on january  this ppa is being accounted for as a capital lease 
gas utilities our gas utilities are focused on the continued investment in our gas distribution network and related technology such as automated meter reading and mobile data terminals 
we received approval in february for rate increases of million at iowa gas for which interim rates were in place effective june we continually monitor our investments and costs of operations in all states to determine when additional rate cases or other rate filings will be necessary 
non regulated energy group power generation our power generation segment was awarded the bid to provide mw of power to our colorado electric subsidiary through a year ppa 
construction costing approximately million for a mw combined cycle natural gas fired power generation facility in colorado was completed in december and this facility commenced commercial operation on january  we plan to continue evaluating opportunities to bid on the construction of generation resources  both new and existing  for other regional electric utilities for their energy and capacity needs 
coal mining production from the coal mining segment primarily serves mine mouth generation plants and select regional customers with long term fuel needs 
total annual production is estimated to be approximately million tons in  which is a decrease from primarily due to the termination of the pacificorp dave johnston contract which expired at the end of however  the termination of this contract should have a positive impact on earnings since the pricing of this contract was such that we were not recovering our costs during the latter periods of the agreement 
our primary strategy is to sell the majority of our coal production to on site  mine mouth generation facilities under long term supply contracts 
historically our off site sales have been to consumers within a close proximity to our mine 
we have recently extended two smaller volume off site sales contracts served by truck 
there are some limitations in regards to transporting our lower heat content coal  however  we continue to pursue new opportunities to market our product 
oil and gas during we completed a strategic review of our oil and gas segment 
we announced a revised strategy focused on proving up and developing the substantial mancos formation shale gas potential of our existing properties in san juan and piceance basins  complemented by limited  high potential oil exploration 
we hired a new vice president and general manager to lead the business  who started in mid december 
during much of  bhep s mission was to identify future investment opportunities while conserving capital and strictly controlling costs 
we completed three test wells in the mancos formation drilling program in the san juan and piceance basins with very promising results 
two of these wells resulted in bcfe of net reserves through the addition of two proved developed producing wells and five proved undeveloped locations 
the third well was completed too late for reserves to be included in our year end reserve study 
we expect to book those reserves during we will continue our efforts into in anticipation of providing attractive oil and gas investment opportunities 
we intend to commence a single rig drilling program in the san juan basin in mid targeting the mancos shale with four wells drilled during the year 
corporate on november   we settled our equity forward offering of  shares providing approximately million of cash proceeds 
we also entered into a new million term loan to fund our working capital needs and for other corporate purposes and extended our million term loan for two years 
on february   we entered into a new year million revolving credit facility at favorable terms 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million  which do not currently qualify for hedge accounting treatment provided by accounting standards for derivatives and hedges 
accordingly  all mark to market adjustments on these swaps are recorded through the income statement 
as of december   the mark to market value of these swaps was a liability of million 
in  we recorded an unrealized mark to market after tax loss of million on these swaps 
fluctuations in interest rates create volatility in the fair value of these swaps which will likely have an impact on our earnings as we record the associated unrealized mark to market gains or losses within our income statement

the proposed facility will include construction of one simple cycle  mw combustion turbine that will be wholly owned by cheyenne light and one combined cycle  mw unit that will be jointly owned by cheyenne light and black hills power 
cheyenne light will own mw and black hills power will own mw of the combined cycle unit 
pending wpsc approval  commercial operation would commence in a hearing with the wpsc is scheduled in july  in june  the sdpuc approved an environmental improvement adjustment tariff for black hills power 
the environmental improvement adjustment  which was implemented to recover black hills power s investment of million for pollution control equipment at the pacificorp operated wyodak plant  went into effect on june  with an annual revenue increase of million  on august   colorado electric received approval from the cpuc to rate base ownership in a mw wind turbine project as part of its plan to meet colorado s renewable energy standard 
the cpuc authorized us to conduct a competitive solicitation for ownership of the other of the project under which a partner was selected in december and a renewable energy purchase agreement and participation agreement was executed on december  colorado electric s share of this project is expected to cost approximately million 
it is expected to begin serving colorado electric customers no later than december   and on march   colorado electric filed a request for a cpcn to construct a third utility owned mw natural gas fired turbine with an approximate cost of million  excluding transmission 
this cpcn request was filed in accordance with a december cpuc order 
this order approved the retirement of the wn clark coal fired power plant under the colorado clean air clean jobs act and granted a presumption of need for a portion of a third utility owned turbine at the pueblo airport generation station 
a settlement with some of the intervenors was reached and a settlement hearing occurred on october  on december   an administrative law judge issued a recommendation to deny colorado electric s request and the terms of the settlement agreement 
colorado electric submitted an exception filing on january   and an initial decision from the cpuc is expected in mid non regulated energy group highlights of the non regulated energy group include the following in january  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the outstanding stock of enserco energy  inc  our energy marketing segment

the revolving credit facility will be used to fund working capital needs and other corporate purposes  in july  we completed a public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due july  the notes were priced at par and carry an interest rate of  in november  we entered into an equity forward offering for  shares 
in december  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option and purchased  additional shares 
we settled the equity forward instruments in november  in december  we entered into a million unsecured one year term loan 
the cost of borrowings under the loan is based on a spread of over libor  and we recorded a million reduction in tax expense reflecting a re measurement of a tax position in accordance with accounting for uncertain tax positions 
approximately million of this benefit was recorded in the corporate segment 
the re measurement was prompted by a settlement agreement that was reached with the irs appeals division primarily regarding tax depreciation method changes 
operating results a discussion of operating results from our business segments follows

operations and maintenance increased million primarily due to higher allocation of corporate costs driven by an increased asset base in the electric utilities  additional costs associated with wygen iii  which commenced commercial operation on april   and approximately million of deferred power marketing costs that were recognized in upon settlement of an off system sales sharing mechanism with the cpuc  partially offset by suspension of the osage plant 
gain on sale of operating assets in relates to the sale of assets to a related party 
this gain was eliminated from the consolidated results of the company 
the gain on sale of operating assets in represents the sale of a ownership interest in the wygen iii generating facility to the city of gillette  wy 
depreciation and amortization increased million primarily due to a higher asset base including additional depreciation associated with wygen iii  which began commercial operation on april  interest expense  net increased million due to higher borrowings related to recent capital projects  partially offset by increased afudc borrowed and interest income 
afudc borrowed increased million at colorado electric due to construction of the pueblo airport generating station  offset by a decrease in afudc borrowed at black hills power of million due to the commencement of commercial operations of wygen iii

gain on sale of operating assets a gain on sale was recognized in on the sale of a ownership interest in the wygen iii generating facility to the city of gillette 
depreciation and amortization costs increased million primarily due to the addition of the wygen iii plant placed into service on april interest expense  net increased million primarily due to higher net interest expense of million compared to the same period in the prior year due to debt incurred for plant construction and as a result of higher rates associated with long term financings in compared to rates on short term debt held in  partially offset by an increase in afudc borrowed of million 
afudc borrowed increased million at colorado electric for the plant construction  offset by a decrease in afudc borrowed at black hills power of million due to the commencement of commercial operations of wygen iii 
other income  net decreased million primarily due to lower afudc equity of million  which decreased upon the placement of wygen iii into commercial operation 
additionally  included a gain of million from the sale of so emission credits 
income tax expense the effective tax rate decreased primarily as a result of a million tax benefit for a rate case settlement related to expensing certain items that had been capitalized for income tax purposes  partially offset by lower benefit from afudc equity which decreased upon commercial operations of wygen iii 
gas utilities operating results for the years ended december for the gas utilities were as follows in thousands revenue natural gas regulated other non regulated total revenue cost of sales natural gas regulated other non regulated total cost of sales gross margin natural gas regulated other non regulated total gross margin operations and maintenance gain on sale of operating assets depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other expense income  net income tax expense income from continuing operations compared to gross margin increased million primarily due to an increase in rates from rate case settlements

gain on sale of operating assets was recognized in on assets sold to the city of omaha  ne following annexation of a portion of our service territory by the city 
depreciation and amortization decreased million primarily due to certain assets that became fully depreciated during  partially offset by capital expenditures during interest expense  net decreased million primarily due to lower inter company debt and allocation of debt service within the assigned capital structure 
other expense income  net was comparable to the same period in the prior year 
income tax expense the effective tax rate for decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of a true up adjustment related to the tax filing and a flow through tax adjustment at iowa gas 
compared to gross margin increased million primarily due to new and interim rates at colorado gas  nebraska gas and iowa gas  and an approved gas system reliability surcharge at kansas gas  which were not effective for a full year in  partially offset by lower volumes as a result of milder weather in operations and maintenance increased million primarily due to increases in employee benefit costs  workers compensation insurance and litigation related expenses 
gain on sale of operating assets a gain on sale was recognized in on assets sold to the city of omaha  nebraska following annexation of a portion of our service territory by the city

non regulated energy group oil and gas oil and gas operating results for the years ended december were as follows in thousands revenue operations and maintenance depreciation  depletion and amortization impairment of long lived assets total operating expenses operating income loss interest expense  net other income expense  net income tax benefit expense income loss from continuing operations the following tables provide certain operating statistics for the oil and gas segment crude oil and natural gas production bbls of oil sold mcfe of natural gas sold mcf equivalent sales average price received a gas mcf b oil bbl a net of hedge settlement gains losses b exclusive of gas liquids depletion expense mcfe the average depletion rate per mcfe is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented 
the increased depletion rate in is primarily driven by the high cost of wells associated with our drilling activities in the bakken shale formation 
the rate was particularly impacted by a lower asset base as a result of previous asset impairment charges 
this impact was partially offset by persistent low product prices during the year  which resulted in lower oil and gas reserve quantities 
the following is a summary of certain annual average operating expenses per mcfe at december loe gathering compression and processing production taxes total san juan piceance powder river williston all other properties total loe gathering compression and processing production taxes total san juan piceance powder river williston all other properties total loe gathering compression and processing production taxes total san juan piceance powder river williston all other properties total at the east blanco field in new mexico and our piceance basin assets in colorado  we own and operate gas gathering systems  including associated compression and treating facilities 
the following is a summary of our proved oil and gas reserves at december bbls of oil in thousands mmcf of natural gas total mmcfe reserves are based on reports prepared by an independent consulting and engineering firm 
the reports were prepared by cg a 
reserves were determined using sec defined product prices 
such reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and may be subject to revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the current estimate takes into account production of approximately bcfe  additions from extensions  discoveries and acquisitions of bcfe and negative revisions to previous estimates of bcfe  primarily due to reserve aging 
reserves reflect sec defined pricing held constant for the life of the reserves  as follows oil gas oil gas oil gas nymex prices well head reserve prices compared to revenue increased million primarily due to a increase in the annual average hedged price received for crude oil and a increase in crude oil production  partially offset by a decrease in the annual average hedged price received for natural gas 
the increase in crude oil production is primarily due to production from new wells in our ongoing bakken drilling program 
natural gas production increased slightly as production from new wells has more than offset natural production declines in existing producing properties  that followed reduced capital deployment during and operations and maintenance increased million primarily as a result of increased production taxes from higher revenue 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million primarily due to a higher depletion rate per mcfe 
the increasing depletion rate is primarily driven by the high cost of wells associated with our drilling activities in the bakken shale formation 
interest expense  net increased million primarily due to increased debt used to finance additional capital expenditures and higher interest rates 
other income  net decreased primarily due to lower earnings from our equity investments 
income tax benefit expense the effective tax rate in both and includes a tax benefit related to percentage depletion 
the effect of such benefit on the effective tax rate was more pronounced in additionally  includes a million re measurement of a previously recorded uncertain tax position prompted by a settlement agreement with the irs appeals division 
compared to revenue increased million primarily due to a and increase in the annual average hedged price of crude oil and gas  respectively  and a increase in crude oil production  partially offset by a decrease of in gas production 
the increase in crude oil production is primarily due to production of new wells in our ongoing bakken drilling program 
the decrease in natural gas production was largely driven by natural production declines from producing properties and reduced capital deployment during and operations and maintenance expenses decreased million primarily as a result of cost containment efforts 
impairment of long lived assets a million non cash ceiling test impairment charge was taken during the first quarter of the write down in the net carrying value of our natural gas and crude oil properties resulted from low march  quarter end natural gas prices for the commodities 
the write down of gas and crude oil properties was based on period end nymex prices of per mcf  adjusted to per mcf at the wellhead  for natural gas and per barrel  adjusted to per barrel at the wellhead  for crude oil 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million primarily due to an increased depletion rate per mcfe resulting from increased investment in our ongoing bakken formation drilling program  partially offset by a decrease in volumes sold 
interest expense  net increased primarily due to increased interest rates 
other income  net was comparable to the same period in the prior year 
income tax benefit expense the effective tax rate in includes a tax benefit related to percentage depletion and a million re measurement of a previously recorded uncertain tax position prompted by a settlement with the irs appeals division 
the tax position related to tax depreciation method changes

operations and maintenance increased million primarily due to higher costs associated with the black hills colorado ipp as employees prepared for operations of the facilities 
this was partially offset by lower operating costs associated with wygen i which incurred a forced outage and major overhaul in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization were comparable to the same period in the prior year 
interest expense  net decreased million primarily due to capitalized interest related to the generation construction at colorado ipp and increased inter company interest income at black hills wyoming 
other income expense  net was comparable to other income to same period in the prior year 
income tax expense the effective tax rate for increased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a true up for research and development credits in compared to revenue in was comparable to the same period in the prior year

gain on sale of operating assets the gain on sale of operating assets in represents the sale of a ownership interest in the wygen i power generation facility  depreciation and amortization were comparable to the same period in the prior year 
interest expense  net decreased million primarily due to a decrease in debt from an intercompany debt restructuring partially offset by interest expense associated with the million project financing at black hills wyoming 
other income expenses  net in was comparable to other income in income tax expense the effective tax rate for decreased compared to primarily due to the effect of research and development tax credits in coal mining coal mining operating results for the years ended december were as follows in thousands revenue operations and maintenance depreciation  depletion and amortization total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net other income  net income tax expense income loss from continuing operations the following table provides certain operating statistics for the coal mining segment in thousands tons of coal sold cubic yards of overburden moved coal reserves at year end compared to revenue increased million primarily due to a increase in average price per ton partially offset by a decrease in volumes sold as a result of overhauls and unplanned outages at the pacificorp operated wyodak plant 
the higher average sales price reflects the impact of price escalators and adjustments in certain of our sales contracts 
in  approximately of our coal production was sold under contracts that include price adjustments based on actual mining costs 
most of our remaining production is sold under contracts where the sales price may escalate based on published indices 
these escalators have not kept up with actual mining cost increases  reducing coal mine operating income and negatively impacting results 
one of these contracts  representing of the tons sold during  was terminated at december  operations and maintenance increases of million reflect longer haul distances and higher overburden stripping costs in the current phase of our mining 
additionally  we experienced higher costs associated with drilling and blasting  equipment maintenance  clay parting removal  fuel  staffing levels for our train load out facility and weather conditions 
as noted above  a portion of our production is sold under contracts that have price escalators based on published indices 
these escalators have not kept up with actual mining cost increases  reducing coal mine operating income and negatively impacting results 
one of these contracts  representing of the tons sold during  was terminated at december  previous periods also include the capitalization of certain costs associated with mine infrastructure  including our in pit conveyor system used to transport coal to mine mouth generation facilities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization was comparable to the same period in the prior year 
interest income  net increased million primarily due to increased lending to affiliates 
other income  net was comparable to the same period in the prior year 
income tax expense the effective tax rate decreased primarily due to an increased tax benefit from percentage depletion and a research and development credit 
compared to revenue decreased million primarily due to a lower price on coal contracts 
there was a slight decrease in volumes sold primarily due to customer plant outages and lower demand for coal  offset by sales to wygen iii  which commenced commercial operations in april operations and maintenance decreased million 
during  the company received approval from wyoming s department of environmental quality for a revised post mining topography plan 
the new plan includes a more efficient method of conducting final reclamation of the mine site by re assessing the handling of overburden 
accordingly  a higher percentage of our overburden removal activities also qualify as reclamation backfill activities 
this change resulted in lower operations expense and a related increase in depletion of reclamation costs 
cubic yards of overburden moved increased 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million primarily due to an increase in depletion of reclamation costs as discussed in operations and maintenance 
interest income  net increased million primarily due to increased lending to affiliates at higher interest rates 
other income  net decreased million primarily due to lower rental income related to the wygen iii site lease 
the site lease was entered into in the third quarter of with billings back to march income taxes the effective tax rate decreased primarily due to an increased tax benefit generated by percentage depletion 
corporate corporate results represent unallocated costs for administrative activities that support the business segments 
corporate also includes business development activities that do not fall under the two business groups as well as allocated costs associated with discontinued operations that could not be included in discontinued operations

we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of for comparative purposes  all prior results of our energy marketing segment presented have been restated to reflect the reclassification of this segment to discontinued operations on a consistent basis 
gross margins by commodity for the years ended december  natural gas crude oil coal power environmental total realized unrealized total natural gas crude oil coal a power a environmental a total realized unrealized total natural gas crude oil coal a power a environmental a total realized unrealized total a activity of coal marketing commenced june  and power and environmental marketing commenced late in the third quarter of compared to income from discontinued operations was million in compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
these results were driven by increased realized margins for crude oil of million and unrealized margins for power marketing of million  partially offset by lower unrealized margins for natural gas and crude oil of million and million  respectively 
the increase in power marketing was due to a long term supply contract while the decrease in natural gas marketing was a result of lower natural gas prices 
these margin increases were partially offset by a higher provision for incentive compensation related to the increased margins and increased employee costs associated with employee additions required to market the new commodities added in compared to income from discontinued operations was million in compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
gross margin increased million due to higher incremental margins in natural gas and crude oil marketing 
a coal marketing business was acquired in june  also produced positive incremental margins 
the margin increases were partially offset by a higher provision for incentive compensation related to the increased margins and increased employee costs associated with employee additions required to market commodities added in critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in application 
there are also areas which require management s judgment in selecting among available gaap alternatives 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from our estimates and to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
the following discussion of our critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with note  business description and significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate for impairment  the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting standards 
for long lived assets with finite lives  this evaluation is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the anticipated future cash flows over the expected useful life of the assets is less than the assets carrying value  then a permanent non cash write down equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and the assets fair value is required to be charged to earnings 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use a probability weighted average expected cash flow method with assumptions based on those used for internal budgets 
the determination of future cash flows  and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is by its nature a highly subjective judgment 
significant assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the evaluation of our long lived assets 
according to accounting standards  goodwill and other intangibles are required to be evaluated whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually 
we conduct our annual evaluations as of november of each year 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment 
the underlying assumptions used for determining fair value are susceptible to change from period to period and could potentially result in a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about future revenues and operating costs  the amount and timing of anticipated capital expenditures for power generating facilities  discount rates  inflation rates  and economic conditions  require significant judgment 
we have million in goodwill as of december   of which million relates to our black hills energy utilities 
colorado electric carries of the black hills energy goodwill 
for the colorado electric impairment analysis  we estimate the fair value of the goodwill using a discounted cash flows methodology 
this analysis requires the input of several critical assumptions in building our risk adjusted discount rate and cash flow projections including future growth rates  operating cost escalation rates  amount and timing of growth capital expenditures  timing and level of success in regulatory rate proceedings  and the cost of debt and equity capital 
we believe the goodwill amount reflected the value of the opportunity to construct the recently completed mw of utility owned generation at the pueblo airport generation station plus the opportunity to build significant additional amounts of rate base generation and transmission in the several years after the acquisition followed by the relatively stable  long lived cash flows of the regulated utility business  considering the regulatory environment and market growth potential 
the results of the analysis show colorado electric with a carrying value of million as of november   compared to a fair value of billion 
the fair value exceeds the carrying value by  therefore  we do not have an impairment 
the gas utilities carry the remaining of the black hills energy goodwill 
we tested this goodwill for impairment using an ebitda multiple method and a discounted cash flows method at each reporting unit 
the analysis required the input of several critical assumptions in determining ebitda  the multiple to apply to ebitda  cash flow projections and risk adjusted discount rate 
these assumptions include future growth rates  operating cost escalation rates  timing and level of success in regulatory rate proceedings  and long term earnings and merger multiples for comparable companies 
the results of the analysis show the gas utilities with a carrying value of million as of november   compared to a fair value of million 
the fair value exceeds the carrying value by  therefore  we do not have an impairment 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method whereby all productive and nonproductive costs related to acquisition  exploration  development  abandonment and reclamation activities are capitalized 
these costs are amortized using a unit of production method based on volumes produced and proved reserves 
any conveyances of properties  including gains or losses on abandonments of properties  are treated as adjustments to the cost of the properties with no gain or loss recognized 
net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
this method values the reserves based upon sec defined prices for oil and gas as of the end of each reporting period adjusted for contracted price changes 
the prices  as well as costs and development capital  are assumed to remain constant for the remaining life of the properties 
if the net capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  then a permanent non cash write down is required to be charged to earnings in that reporting period 
under these sec defined product prices  our net capitalized costs were more than the full cost ceiling at march   which required a write down of million after tax 
under the sec defined product prices at december   no additional write down was required 
reserves in and were determined consistent with sec requirements using a month average price calculated using the first day of the month price for each of the months in the reporting period held constant for the life of the properties 
because of the fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  we can provide no assurance that future write downs will not occur 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
an independent petroleum engineering company prepares reports that estimate our proved oil and natural gas reserves annually 
the accuracy of any oil and natural gas reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and work over costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as oil and gas prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in estimating our oil and natural gas reserves  the estimates are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense  the amortization rate of our capitalized oil and gas properties incorporates the estimated unit of production attributable to the estimates of proved reserves 
the net book value of our oil and gas properties is also subject to a ceiling limitation based in large part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures

derivatives accounting standards for derivatives require the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and their measurement at fair value 
our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative 
the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or fair values 
the effective portion of changes in fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss until it is reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in current earnings 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized in current earnings along with fair value changes of the underlying hedged item 
we currently use derivative instruments  including options  swaps  futures  forwards and other contractual commitments for non trading hedging purposes 
our typical hedging transactions relate to contracts we enter into to fix the price received for anticipated future production at our oil and gas segment  or to fulfill the natural gas hedging plans for gas and electric utilities see below  and for interest rate swaps we enter into to convert a portion of our variable rate debt  or associated variable rate interest payments  to a fixed rate 
our energy marketing segment  now included in discontinued operations as a result of the pending sale expected to be completed in the first quarter of  utilizes various physical and financial contracts to effectively manage a marketing and trading portfolio 
fair values of derivative instruments contracts are based on actively quoted market prices or other external source pricing information  where possible 
if external market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors and pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recorded  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million that are not designated as hedge instruments 
accordingly  mark to market changes in value on the swaps are recorded within the income statement 
a move in the interest rate curves over the term of the swaps would have a pre tax impact of approximately million 
these swaps have remaining terms of and years and have amended mandatory early termination dates ranging from december  to december   respectively 
counterparty credit risk and allowance for doubtful accounts our largest counterparties consist primarily of major energy companies 
this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market  economic or regulatory conditions 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and by imposing collateral requirements under certain circumstances  including the use of master netting agreements 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
the allowances provided are estimated and may be impacted by economic  market and regulatory conditions  which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and significantly impact future results of operations 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and established provisions  we can provide no assurance that our actual credit losses will be consistent with our estimates 
pension and other postretirement benefits as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  we have three defined benefit pension plans  three defined post retirement healthcare plans and several non qualified retirement plans 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions  the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of future increases in compensation levels  and healthcare cost projections 
the determination of our obligation and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the assumptions determined by management and used by actuaries in calculating the amounts 
although we believe our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
the pension benefit cost for for our non contributory funded pension plan is expected to be million compared to million in the estimated discount rate used to determine annual benefit cost accruals will be in  the discount rate used in was 
in selecting the discount rate  we consider cash flow durations for each plan s liabilities and returns on high credit quality fixed income yield curves for comparable durations 
we do not pre fund our non qualified pension plans 
one of the three postretirement benefit plans is partially funded 
the table below shows the expected impacts of an increase or decrease to our healthcare trend rate for our three retiree healthcare plans in thousands change in assumed trend rate impact on december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation impact on service and interest cost increase decrease contingencies when it is probable that an environmental or other legal liability has been incurred  a loss is recognized when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the probability and the amount of loss are made based on currently available facts 
accounting for contingencies requires significant judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to potential liability 
our assessment of our exposure to contingencies could change to the extent there are additional future developments  or as more information becomes available 
if actual obligations incurred are different from our estimates  the recognition of the actual amounts could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized  at currently enacted income tax rates  to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the amount of deferred tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and provides any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if we determine that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretations of tax laws and the resolution of current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the following liquidity and market risk discussion has been revised to reflect the planned divestiture of our energy marketing segment 
overview information about our financial position as of december is presented in the following table dollars in thousands financial position summary cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term debt  including current maturities of long term debt long term debt stockholders equity ratios long term debt ratio total debt ratio we believe that our cash on hand  operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacity and ability to complete new debt and equity financings  taken as a whole  provide sufficient resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements  debt maturities  anticipated dividends  and anticipated capital expenditures during the next months 
liquidity historically  our principal sources of short term liquidity have been our revolving credit facilities and cash from operations 
we have utilized availability under our revolving credit facilities to manage our cash flow needs  which are affected by the seasonality of our businesses 
in order to take advantage of favorable rates  we have entered into two term loans which were used to repay a portion of our revolving credit facility 
our principal sources for our long term capital needs have been proceeds raised from public and private offerings of equity and long term debt securities issued by the company and its subsidiaries 
we have also managed liquidity needs through hedging activities  primarily in connection with seasonal needs of our utility operations including seasonal peaks in fuel requirements  interest rate movements  and commodity price movements 
in january  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our energy marketing segment  which resulted in the reporting of this segment as discontinued operations 
this divestiture is expected to be completed during the first quarter of and is expected to provide net cash proceeds of approximately million to million which will primarily be used for future growth projects 
completion of the planned divestiture of our energy marketing segment will improve our credit metrics  reduce our overall risk profile and reduce our equity financing needs for planned growth projects 
at december   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash on hand in addition to availability under our revolving credit facility 
we had the following borrowings  outstanding letters of credit and available capacity in millions current borrowings at letters of credit at available capacity at credit facility expiration capacity december  december  december  revolving credit facility april  the revolving credit facility was replaced when we entered into a new revolving credit facility on february  see credit facilities and long term debt below 
working capital the most significant items impacting working capital are our capital expenditures  the purchase of natural gas for our utilities group and our power generation segment and payment of dividends to shareholders 
we could experience significant working capital requirements during peak months of the winter heating season due to higher natural gas consumption and during periods of high natural gas prices 
we anticipate using a combination of credit capacity available under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand to meet our peak winter working capital requirements 
anticipated financing plans we have substantial capital expenditures projected in  a majority of which is due to the construction of additional utility generation to serve our utility customers and comply with environmental standards 
our capital requirements are expected to be financed through a combination of operating cash flows  borrowings on our revolving credit facility  term loans and long term financings 
we may complete an additional long term financing at the holding company level in to extend the term of a portion of our short term debt and refinance obligations coming due in the next to months 
we are evaluating financing options including senior unsecured notes  first mortgage bonds  term loans  project financing and equity issuance to fund our capital expenditures 
we intend to maintain a consolidated debt to capitalization level in the range of to  however  due to significant ongoing capital projects  we may exceed this level on a temporary basis 
we anticipate that our existing credit capacity and available cash will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and our maintenance capital requirements 
we do not currently anticipate any difficulty accessing debt or equity markets 
factors influencing liquidity many of our operations are subject to seasonal and market driven fluctuations in cash flow 
we have traditionally sourced variations in the working capital needs of our subsidiaries with cash on hand and capacity available under our credit facilities 
increases in commodity prices may also lead to additional liquidity needs 
as a utility holding company which owns several regulated utilities  we are subject to various regulations that could influence our liquidity 
for example  the issuance of debt by our utility subsidiaries including the ability of black hills utility holdings to issue debt and the use of our utility assets as collateral generally requires the prior approval of the state regulators in the state in which the utility assets are located 
as a result of our holding company structure  our right as a common shareholder  to receive assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization  is junior to the claims against the assets of such subsidiaries by their creditors 
therefore  our holding company debt obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future claims of the creditors of our subsidiaries  including trade creditors  debt holders  secured creditors  taxing authorities  and guarantee holders 
due to market conditions  the funding status of our pension plans is subject to multiple variables  many of which are beyond our control  including changes to the fair value of the pension assets and changes in actuarial assumptions in particular  the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation 
as a result  we may be required to contribute significant amounts to our pension plans in and future periods  which could materially affect our liquidity and results of operations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
credit facilities and long term debt revolving credit facility at december   we had a million revolving credit facility with an expiration date of april  which contained an accordion feature which allowed us  with the consent of the administrative agent  to increase the capacity of the facility to million 
this revolving credit facility was used for the issuance of letters of credit  to fund working capital needs and for other corporate purposes 
borrowings were available under a base rate option or a eurodollar option 
the cost of borrowings or letters of credit under this revolving credit facility was determined based upon our credit ratings 
at current year end credit ratings levels  the margins for base rate borrowings  eurodollar borrowings and letters of credit were  and  respectively at december  this facility also contained a commitment fee charged on the unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
based upon current year end credit ratings  the fee was 
the revolving credit facility in existence at december  contained customary affirmative and negative covenants  such as limitations on the creation of new indebtedness and on certain liens  restrictions on certain transactions  and maintenance of the following financial covenants i consolidated net worth in an amount of not less than the sum of million and of our aggregate consolidated net income  if positive  beginning january  and ii a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to 
subject to applicable cure periods  a violation of any of these covenants would constitute an event of default that entitles the lenders to terminate their remaining commitments and accelerate all principal and interest outstanding 
we were in compliance with the covenants at december  our consolidated net worth was billion at december   which was approximately million in excess of the net worth we were required to maintain under the credit facility 
at december   our long term debt ratio was  our total debt leverage ratio long term debt and short term debt was  and our recourse leverage ratio was approximately 
under the prior revolving credit facilities  our consolidated net worth requirement is calculated by taking million plus of the net income  if positive  of the company since january  our long term debt ratio is the ratio of our long term debt over long term debt plus our net worth 
our total debt leverage ratio is the same as our long term debt ratio with the addition of current maturities of long term debt and notes payable in the calculation 
our recourse leverage ratio is the ratio of our recourse debt  letters of credit and guarantees issued over our total capital which includes the balance in the numerator plus our net worth 
in order to take advantage of favorable pricing within current market conditions  we entered into a new million revolving credit facility 
the new five year revolving credit facility effective february   now expiring on february   remains at million with an accordion feature which allows us  with the consent of the administrative agent and issuing agents  to increase the capacity of the facility to million and can be used for the issuance of letters of credit  to fund working capital needs and other corporate purposes 
borrowings are available under a base rate or various eurodollar rate options 
the interest costs associated with letters of credit or borrowings under the agreement are determined based upon our credit ratings 
at our current credit rating  the margins for base rate borrowings  eurodollar borrowings and letters of credit are  and  respectively 
the facility contains a commitment fee to be charged on the unused amount of the revolving credit facility  which is based on current credit ratings 
the new revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  such as limitations on the creation of new indebtedness and on certain liens  restrictions on certain transactions  and maintaining consolidated net worth and certain ratios  including a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to 
subject to applicable cure periods  a violation of any of these covenants would constitute an event of default that entitles the lenders to terminate their remaining commitments and accelerate all principal and interest outstanding 
under the new revolving credit facilities  our recourse leverage ratio is the ratio of our recourse debt  letters of credit and guarantees issued over our total capital which includes the balance in the numerator plus our net worth 
in addition to covenant violations under the prior and new revolving credit facilities  an event of default under the credit facility may be triggered by other events  such as a failure to make payments when due or a failure to make payments when due in respect of  or a failure to perform obligations relating to  other debt obligations of million or more 
subject to applicable cure periods none of which apply to a failure to timely pay indebtedness  an event of default would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the credit facility for loans or new letters of credit  and could require both the immediate repayment of any principal and interest outstanding and the cash collateralization of outstanding letter of credit obligations 
the prior and new credit facilities prohibit us from paying cash dividends if a default or an event of default exists prior to  or would result after giving effect to such action 
corporate term loans in june  we entered into a one year million unsecured  single draw  term loan the term loan with cobank  the bank of nova scotia and us bank due on june  the cost of borrowing under the term loan is based on a spread of over libor at december

market risk disclosures our activities expose us to a number of risks in the normal operation of our businesses 
depending on the activity  we are exposed to varying degrees of market risk and counterparty risk 
we have developed policies  processes  systems  and controls to manage and mitigate these risks 
market risk is the potential loss that might occur as a result of an adverse change in market price or rate 
we are exposed to the following market risks commodity price risk associated with our natural long position with crude oil and natural gas reserves and production  fuel procurement for certain of our gas fired generation assets and variability in revenue due to changes in gas usage at our regulated electric and gas utilities segments resulting from commodity price changes  and interest rate risk associated with our variable rate credit facilities and our project financing floating rate debt as described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our exposure to these market risks is affected by a number of factors including the size  duration  and composition of our energy portfolio  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices  the volatility of these prices and rates  and the liquidity of the related interest rate and commodity markets 
to manage and mitigate these identified risks  we have adopted the black hills corporation risk policies and procedures 
these policies have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
these policies relate to numerous matters including governance  control infrastructure  authorized commodities and trading instruments  prohibited activities  and employee conduct 
the executive risk committee  which includes senior level executives  meets on a regular basis to review our business and credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the authorized policies 
utilities group we produce  purchase and distribute power in four states  and purchase and distribute natural gas in five states 
all of our utilities have pga provisions that allow them to pass the prudently incurred cost of gas through to the customer 
to the extent that gas prices are higher or lower than amounts in our current billing rates  adjustments are made on a periodic basis to true up billed amounts to match the actual natural gas cost we incurred 
these adjustments are subject to periodic prudence reviews by the state utility commissions 
in south dakota  colorado  wyoming and montana  we have a mechanism for our regulated electric utilities that serves a purpose similar to the pgas for our regulated gas utilities 
to the extent that our fuel and purchased power energy costs are higher or lower than the energy cost built into our tariffs  the difference or a portion thereof is passed through to the customer 
as allowed or required by state utility commissions  we have entered into certain exchange traded natural gas futures  options and basis swaps to reduce our customers underlying exposure to volatility of natural gas prices 
these transactions are considered derivatives and are marked to market 
gains or losses  as well as option premiums on these transactions  are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities 
the fair value of our utilities group derivative contracts are summarized below in thousands december  december  net derivative liabilities cash collateral oil and gas oil and gas exploration and production we produce natural gas and crude oil through our exploration and production activities 
our reserves are natural long positions  or unhedged open positions  and introduce commodity price risk and variability in our cash flows 
we employ risk management methods to mitigate this commodity price risk and preserve our cash flows 
we have adopted guidelines covering hedging for our natural gas and crude oil production 
these guidelines have been approved by our board of directors 
to mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows  we primarily use over the counter swaps and options 
our hedging policy allows up to of our natural gas and of our crude oil production from proven producing reserves to be hedged for a period up to two years in the future 
our hedging strategy is conducted from an enterprise wide risk perspective  accordingly  we might not externally hedge a portion of our natural gas production when we have offsetting price risk for the fuel requirements of certain of our power generating activities 
we have entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its estimated and natural gas and crude oil production 
the hedge agreements in place as of december  are as follows natural gas location transaction date hedge type term volume mmbtu day price san juan el paso swap nwr swap aeco swap cig swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap nwr swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap cig swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap crude oil location transaction date hedge type term volume bbls month price nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex call nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex call nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex call nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex call nymex put nymex call nymex put our hedge agreements had a fair value of approximately million as of december  wholesale power a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
these short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to control such risk  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities and purchased power resources exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
financing activities we engage in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our floating rate debt obligations 
at december   we had million of notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  having a maximum term of years 
these swaps have been designated as hedges in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedges and accordingly their mark to market adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
we also have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million which were entered into for the purpose of hedging interest rate movements that would impact long term financings that were originally expected to occur in the swaps were originally designated as cash flow hedges and the mark to market value was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
based on credit market conditions that transpired during the fourth quarter of  we determined it was probable that the forecasted long term debt financings would not occur in the time period originally specified and as a result  the swaps were no longer effective hedges and the hedge relationships were de designated 
mark to market adjustments on the swaps are now recorded within the income statement and during and we recorded a million and a million pre tax unrealized mark to market loss to earnings  respectively  while in we recorded a million pre tax unrealized mark to market gain to earnings 
these swaps are and year swaps which have amended mandatory early termination dates ranging from december  to december   respectively 
we have continued to maintain these swaps in anticipation of our upcoming financing needs  particularly our upcoming holding company debt maturities  which are million and million in and  respectively 
alternatively  we may choose to cash settle these swaps at their fair value prior to their mandatory early termination dates  or unless these dates are extended  we will cash settle these swaps for an amount equal to their fair value on the stated termination dates 
further details of the swap agreements are set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k

credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from non performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty 
we have adopted the black hills corporation credit policy that establishes guidelines  controls  and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within risk tolerances established by the board of directors 
in addition  our executive credit committee  which includes senior executives  meets on a regular basis to review our credit activities and to monitor compliance with the adopted policies 
we seek to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies  setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength  obtaining netting agreements  and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental guarantees  prepayments  letters of credit  and other security agreements 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions established  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past  or that an investment grade counterparty will not default sometime in the future 
at december   approximately of our credit exposure including our energy marketing segment but exclusive of retail customers of our regulated utilities was with investment grade companies 
the remaining credit exposure is with non investment grade or non rated counterparties  of which a portion was supported through letters of credit  prepayments  or parental guarantees 
trading activities energy marketing as of december   we have a natural gas  crude oil  coal  power and environmental marketing business specializing in producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing that conducts business in the united states and canada 
for producer services our main objective is to provide value in the supply chain by acting as the producer s marketing arm for wellhead purchases  scheduling services  imbalance management  risk management services and transportation management 
we accomplish this goal through industry experience  extensive contacts  transportation and risk management expertise  trading skills and personal attention

this transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of to effectively manage our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing portfolios  we enter into forward physical commodity contracts  financial derivative instruments including over the counter swaps and options  and storage and transportation agreements 
we conduct our energy marketing business activities within the parameters as defined and allowed in the bhcrpp and further delineated in the energy marketing risk management policies and procedures as approved by our executive risk committee 
monitoring and reporting market risk exposures we use a number of quantitative tools to measure  monitor and limit our exposure to market risk in our natural gas  oil  coal  power and environmental marketing portfolio 
we limit and monitor our market risk through established limits on the nominal size of positions based on type of trade  location and duration 
such limits include those on fixed price  basis  index  storage  transportation and foreign exchange positions
