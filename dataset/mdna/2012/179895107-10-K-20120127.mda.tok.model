components of this increase in net sales are as follows volume pricing foreign exchange transweb acquisition 
table of contents net sales in our engine mobile filtration segment were higher in than primarily on the strength of higher heavy duty engine filter sales both in the us  where sales grew  and internationally  where sales grew 
net sales in our industrial environmental filtration segment were higher in than primarily based upon higher net sales in the us including sales from our acquisition of transweb  which was completed at the end of december net sales at our packaging segment were lower in than however  excluding the impact of a no margin tooling and equipment sale to one of our customers in  net sales at our packaging segment increased million  or  in compared with cost of sales our cost of sales increased million  or  from this increase in cost of sales was primarily the result of the increase in net sales 
our gross margin percentage in was percentage points higher than this increase in gross margin percentage was primarily the result of our ability to leverage manufacturing overhead while maintaining relatively stable raw material costs as a percentage of net sales as we were able to increase prices by approximately in to effectively pass through higher commodity costs to our customers 
because a majority of our sales are into the aftermarket where we do not have long term contracts  we had the ability to pass the impact of commodity cost increases onto our customers in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  in from this increase was the result of million higher employee costs and million higher other selling and administrative expenses to support our domestic and international growth 
these higher selling and administrative expenses were partially offset by a million decline in compensation related to our company wide profit sharing program 
with selling and administrative expenses growing only while our net sales increased  we reduced our selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to in from in versus our operating performance improved from primarily due to a million  or  increase in net sales 
the incremental net sales allowed us to leverage our manufacturing overhead and increase our gross margin percentage to from in the million increase in net sales was the result of a million increase at our engine mobile filtration segment and a million increase at our packaging segment 
the net sales increase at our packaging segment included a no margin million tooling and equipment sale to one of our customers 
net sales at our industrial environmental filtration segment increased million compared with despite a million decline in hvac filter sales to m as we were informed by m in the third quarter of that it would no longer be purchasing air filters from us 
accordingly  we had no air filter sales to m in the increase in operating margin to in from in was primarily the result of a percentage point improvement in gross margin percentage 
this percentage point improvement was a result of the net sales increase and the associated leveraging of manufacturing overhead in addition to the cost benefits from the restructuring of our hvac filter operations 
the gross margin percentage in was our highest annual gross margin percentage at that time in almost twenty years 
selling and administrative expenses in as a percentage of net sales were consistent with but increased million primarily as a result of incremental employee compensation associated with our company wide profit sharing program and additional legal expenses partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense 
the operating margin in not only was percentage points greater than  but it was equivalent to the operating margin from despite million lower net sales 
we were able to generate a operating margin equivalent to despite lower net sales in compared to as a result of various cost efficiencies implemented in including the benefits of the aforementioned restructuring program at our hvac filter operations 
as a result of this improved operating performance  diluted earnings per share of in was greater than diluted earnings per share of in and greater than diluted earnings per share of in 
table of contents other items other significant items impacting the comparison between the years presented are as follows fifty third week included fifty three weeks in its fiscal year while included fifty two weeks in its fiscal year 
significant acquisitions the acquisition of transweb in the first quarter of increased our net sales excluding million of net sales to other clarcor companies and operating profit as follows dollars in thousands net sales operating profit foreign exchange the average exchange rate for foreign currencies versus the us dollar favorably impacted our translated us dollar value of net sales and operating profit in both and as follows dollars in thousands net sales operating profit other income expense interest expense interest expense was million in both and interest expense declined million in compared with million of this decrease was due to the impact of a mark to market adjustment on an interest rate swap agreement in the remaining million decline primarily resulted from lower interest expense on our line of credit primarily driven by lower average outstanding balances million in compared to million in 
foreign currency gains and losses changes in foreign currency transaction gains and losses positively impacted other income expense by million in versus we recognized a foreign currency gain of million in and a foreign currency loss of million in the foreign currency loss in was from the translation of cash accounts at certain foreign subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
changes in foreign currency transaction gains and losses negatively impacted other income expense by million in versus we recognized a foreign currency loss of million in from the translation of cash accounts at certain foreign subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than their functional currency 
as most foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar throughout  we recognized approximately million of foreign currency gains in mostly related to the translation of us dollar denominated intercompany debt at our non us subsidiaries 
most of this us dollar denominated intercompany debt was repaid by the first quarter of 
table of contents provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in was compared with in this lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the renewal of the research and development tax credit in  a higher domestic production activities deduction in and the recognition of a million tax benefit in from the release of a valuation allowance recorded against net operating loss carryovers at one of our foreign subsidiaries 
the effective tax rate in was compared with in this increase was primarily driven by the expiration of the research and development tax credit in shares outstanding average diluted shares outstanding have remained relatively flat in  and as incremental dilutive shares related to the exercise of stock options and the issuance of restricted shares have been offset by our repurchase of common stock

our us sales of locomotive filters increased approximately in compared with as us rail activity improved 
the increase in net sales outside the us including export sales and adjusted for changes in foreign currency was driven by higher heavy duty engine filter sales in many geographic locations including china where sales increased million  or  from primarily from additional sales of new parts to oem engine manufacturers

us net sales from transweb include only eleven months since the transweb acquisition was completed at the end of december transweb also had foreign net sales of million in increased sales at tfs in was the result of higher filter sales to a variety of markets including aerospace  automotive  chemical and general industrial 
the increase in sales to the aerospace  oil drilling and other industrial markets in was primarily due to higher sales to the commercial aerospace market and of wire mesh filters to the fibers and plastics industries offset by lower sales to the oil drilling industry 
the increase in aviation vessels and aftermarket filters in was due in part to a large new vessel customer and higher order volume of aftermarket filters from existing customers 
higher dust collector system sales in were the result of higher sales of kitchen emission systems and dust hog and smog hog products 
the million decline in foreign net sales adjusted for changes in foreign currency in was primarily driven by million lower aviation  marine and petrochemical filter and vessel sales in europe due to less favorable euro zone economic conditions and million lower natural gas filter and vessel sales in malaysia due to several large orders in that did not repeat in offset by million higher sales of oil and gas products in brazil as we entered that geographic market in and million higher natural gas filter and vessel sales in canada from the addition of sales resources in that geographic market in cost of sales our cost of sales increased million  or  from this increase was primarily the result of the increase in net sales

accordingly  we had no air filter sales to m in in  we sold million of our high end purolator brand residential air filters to a large retail store chain on a trial basis 
these sales did not repeat in the remaining increase in air filter sales in the us in was primarily due to improved general economic conditions 
the increase in us net sales in at tfs was the result of increased filter sales to the automotive and other industrial markets including chemical  metals and power generation 
filter sales to the automotive industry increased million in compared with as the automotive industry recovered from the economic downturn in these automotive industry sales were primarily air filters used in manufacturing and other facilities 

table of contents the increase in us sales to the aerospace  oil drilling and other industrial markets was driven in part by additional parts manufacturer approvals pmas from commercial aerospace customers and as a result of improved general economic conditions which supported net sales increases notably in the wire mesh filter and other industrial markets 
net sales in the us natural gas market increased slightly in compared with due to an increase in aftermarket filter sales offset by a similar reduction in vessel sales 
the increase in aftermarket filter sales was driven by a focused effort to build our market share in this segment 
the reduction in natural gas vessel sales was due to the lower price of natural gas and the related decrease in construction of new natural gas pipelines in compared with the increase in us aviation net sales in was primarily the result of a large military aviation aftermarket filter sale consummated in the third quarter of the decline in foreign sales in was driven by a reduction in european sales primarily in spain and germany 
the reduction in spain was caused by a reduction in military aviation orders 
the reduction in germany was caused by several large system orders consummated in that did not repeat in in addition  a decline in natural gas vessel sales in canada due to the lower price of natural gas contributed to the reduction in foreign sales in these foreign sales reductions were partially offset by an increase in filter sales to the oil drilling market  primarily in asia during the increase in operating profit and margin at our industrial environmental filtration segment was the result of the continued improved operating results at our air filter operations including tfs where operating profit increased in compared with despite lower overall air filter sales in  primarily from the loss of m sales  operating profit increased due to the benefits of our restructuring program which was substantially completed in  lower material costs driven by lower commodity prices and improved material efficiency and lower selling and administrative expenses 
driven by stronger sales  operating profit in our aerospace  oil drilling and other industrial markets increased in compared with the operating profit at the remaining industrial environmental filtration segment markets  including aviation and natural gas  increased in compared with the operating margin increase of percentage points for was primarily influenced by the restructuring efforts at our air filter operations  lower material costs and a higher mix of aftermarket filters which have higher operating margins than vessels sold in our natural gas  aviation and marine markets

at the end of  we have applied charges of approximately million against the amount withheld  leaving a remaining balance of approximately million 
fiscal year in we announced that we intend to invest approximately million in through to expand our manufacturing facility in yankton  south dakota to add capacity to produce heavy duty engine filters 
we expect that this additional capacity will support sales growth in the us and for export and that it will be operational before the end of we anticipate that additional equipment will be added through we believe that our current operations will continue to generate cash and that sufficient borrowings under the credit facility remain available to fund current operating needs  pay dividends  invest in the development of new products and filter media  fund planned capital expenditures and expansion of current facilities  provide for interest payments and required principal payments related to debt agreements  fund pension plan contributions and repurchase common stock 
we also continue to assess acquisition opportunities in related filtration businesses that would expand our market base  distribution coverage or product offerings 
any such acquisitions potentially would affect operating cash flows and require changes in our debt and capitalization 
in addition  capital market disruptions may affect the cost or availability of future borrowings 
we have no material long term purchase commitments 
we will continue to assess repurchases of our common stock 
in june  our board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program of our common stock in the open market and through private transactions over a three year period 
during  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share 
during  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share 
at the end of  there was approximately million available for repurchase under the current authorization 
future repurchases of our common stock may be made after considering cash flow requirements for internal growth  capital expenditures  acquisitions  interest rates and the market price of our common stock 

table of contents the following table summarizes our current fixed cash obligations as of the end of fiscal year for the years indicated payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years pension plan and other post retirement contributions operating leases long term debt excluding line of credit interest on long term debt excluding line of credit contingent earnout payments for acquisitions investment in affiliate total anticipated payments pursuant to our pension plans and for other post retirement benefits are based upon the assumption that we make the minimum required contributions and also make additional contributions to maintain a funded percentage of at least for each plan 
future estimates of our pension plan contributions may change significantly depending upon the actual rate of return on plan assets  discount rates and regulatory requirements 
interest payments on our variable rate debt in the table above are determined based upon current interest rates as of the end of and assume that no additional borrowings or payments will be made on our credit facility during the periods presented 
at the end of fiscal year  our gross liability for uncertain income tax provisions was million including interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements relate to various operating leases as discussed in 
note h to the consolidated financial statements 
we had no variable interest entity or special purpose entity agreements during or other matters critical accounting estimates our critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  depreciation methods  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting and pension and postretirement benefits 
these critical accounting policies may be affected by recent relevant accounting pronouncements discussed in the following section 

table of contents while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these critical accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  we believe the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
the following lists the most critical accounting estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements which require us to use significant judgment and estimates of amounts that are inherently uncertain goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we annually review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter and more often if an event occurs or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
these reviews of fair value involve judgment and estimates of discount rates  terminal values  transaction multiples and future cash flows for the reporting units that may be impacted by future sales and operating results for the reporting units  market conditions and worldwide economic conditions 
all goodwill and intangibles are allocated to the reporting unit component at the time of acquisition 
we have determined that the reporting unit components meet the criteria for aggregation into five reporting units 
these reporting units are aggregated based upon similar economic characteristics  nature of products and services  nature of production processes  type of customers and distribution methods 
in performing our impairment reviews  we estimated the fair values of the aggregated reporting units using a present value method that discounted future cash flows using market participant based assumptions 
for our indefinite lived intangibles  we performed annual impairment tests using the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of our trademarks and trade names 
we further analyzed various discount rates  transaction and capital market multiples and cash flows for aggregated reporting units to assess the reasonableness of our estimates and assumptions 
we believe our valuation techniques and assumptions are reasonable for this purpose 
we have not materially changed our methodology for valuing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
the results of our analysis performed as of december  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value and  accordingly  no impairment existed 
there were no goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal years  or allowance for losses on accounts receivable allowances for losses on customer accounts receivable balances are estimated based on economic conditions in the industries to which we sell and on historical experience by evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss  fluctuations in amounts owed and current payment trends 
our concentration of risk is also monitored and at the end of  the largest outstanding customer account balance was million and the five largest account balances totaled million 
the allowances provided are estimates that may be impacted by economic and market conditions which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and results of operations 
pensions our pension obligations are determined using estimates including those related to discount rates  asset values and changes in compensation 
the discount rate used for each plan was based on the citigroup pension discount curve 
the projected benefit payments in each year were discounted using the appropriate spot rate from the curve 
for each plan  a single discount rate was determined that produced the same total discounted value 
that rate  rounded to basis points  was the discount rate selected for the plan 
the discount rate used for the qualified plans for us employees was selected as the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits under the qualified plan 
the mortality table for the qualified plans is determined based on the actuarial table that is most reflective of the expected mortality of the plan participants 
the mortality table adopted rp projected was developed for pension plans by a society of actuaries study 
the mortality table used for the nonqualified pension plan is specified by the plan agreement 
the assumptions are similarly determined for each pension obligation 
actual results and future obligations will vary based on changes in interest rates  stock and bond market valuations and employee compensation 
in  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets would result in additional expense of approximately million  and a reduction in the discount rate would result in additional expense of approximately million for our qualified defined benefit pension plans for us covered employees 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss of million at year end is due primarily to prior changes in assumptions related to discount rates and expected asset returns compared to actual asset returns 
this actuarial loss will be recognized as pension expense in the future over the average remaining service period of the employees in the plans

note i to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents income taxes we are required to estimate and record income taxes payable for each of the us and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal  state and international tax transactions for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of such situations and believe that it is properly reserved 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amendments to its goodwill impairment testing guidance to simplify how entities test for goodwill impairments 
the amendments are intended to reduce complexity and cost by providing a company the option of making an initial qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment in determining whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
the amendments also include examples of events and circumstances that a company should consider in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   although early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance on december  to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amendments to its comprehensive income guidance to a improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting  b increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and c facilitate the convergence of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments require all non owner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the required amendments  pursuant to the guidance  must be applied retrospectively

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk is primarily related to the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we may also be exposed to various market risks that arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business related to items such as the cost of raw materials and changes in inflation 
certain contractual relationships with customers and vendors mitigate risks from changes in raw material costs and currency exchange rate changes that arise from normal purchasing and normal sales activities 
interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to our financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash  cash equivalents and certain short term  highly liquid investments 
interest rate fluctuations could affect earnings  cash flows or the fair value of our financial liabilities 
our debt obligations are primarily at variable rates and are denominated in us dollars 
to minimize the long term costs of borrowing  we manage our interest rate risk by monitoring trends in rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements and the duration of such agreements 
we mitigated our interest rate risk on our borrowing under our revolving line of credit in by entering into a fixed interest rate swap agreement at the beginning of which fixed our interest until january interest rate risk is not expected to be significant to us in fiscal year as amounts outstanding on our long term debt agreements are more than offset by cash and cash equivalents 
the primary interest rate risk will be driven by our return on cash and cash equivalents 
based upon the million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of  a change in interest rates could impact annual interest income by approximately million 
this change in interest income would increase or decrease as cash and cash equivalents increase or decrease 
foreign currency since we operate through subsidiaries in several countries around the world  our reported financial results of operations  including the reported value of assets and liabilities  are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of our subsidiaries  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside the us are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period 
earnings and cash flow statements are translated at weighted average rates of exchange 
although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact  the translation changes may impact the overall value of net assets 
we are also exposed to transaction risk from changes in foreign currency rates through sales and purchasing transactions when we sell products in functional currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred 
the functional currencies of our worldwide facilities primarily include us dollar  euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar  chinese yuan renminbi  malaysian ringgit and mexican peso 
as these currencies fluctuate against each other  and other currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk on sales and purchasing transactions 
currency exchange rates vary daily and often one currency strengthens against the us dollar while another currency weakens 
because of the complex interrelationship of the worldwide supply chains and distribution channels  it is difficult to quantify the impact of a particular change in exchange rates 
however  if the us dollar strengthened or weakened relative to the currencies where our foreign income and cash flows are derived  the estimated effect on the consolidated results of operations would be per diluted share based upon results 
the effect of changes in the average foreign currency translation rates in compared to positively impacted our operating profit by approximately million in commodity prices we are exposed to changing commodity prices  including but not limited to  steel  filter media  resins and other chemicals 
historically  since a large majority of our business units deal with aftermarket customers as opposed to first fit or oem customers where we have greater control of pricing  we have been able to successfully pass significant commodity price increases onto our customers 
in addition  due to the nature of our aftermarket filtration products  we believe our customer demand is rather inelastic  meaning reasonable price increases do not significantly impact customer demand 
in addition  our business units which manufacture filtration vessels or systems are typically able to time customer price quotations with steel purchases and are able to base quotations on actual steel costs 
if we were not able to pass through commodity price increases to our customers  we estimate a increase decrease in the price of all the commodities we purchase would increase decrease cost of sales and decrease increase operating profit by approximately million
