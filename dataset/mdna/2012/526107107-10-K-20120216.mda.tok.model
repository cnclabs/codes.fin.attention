item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussions should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this report  including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we operate in four reportable business segments of the heating  ventilation  air conditioning and refrigeration  hvacr industry 
our reportable segments are residential heating cooling  commercial 
table of contents heating cooling  service experts and refrigeration 
for more detailed information regarding our reportable segments  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our products and services are sold through a combination of distributors  independent and company owned dealer service centers  other installing contractors  wholesalers  manufacturers representatives  original equipment manufacturers and national accounts 
the demand for our products and services is seasonal and dependent on the weather 
warmer than normal summer temperatures generate strong demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services and colder than normal winter temperatures have the same effect on heating products and services 
conversely  cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress hvacr sales and services 
in addition to weather  demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors  such as interest rates  the availability of financing  regional population and employment trends  new construction  general economic conditions and consumer spending habits and confidence 
a substantial portion of the sales in each of our business segments is attributable to replacement business  with the balance comprised of new construction business 
the principal elements of cost of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are components  raw materials  factory overhead  labor and estimated costs of warranty expense 
in our service experts segment  the principal components of cost of goods sold are equipment  parts and supplies and labor 
the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum 
in recent years  the volatility of commodity prices and related components has impacted us and the hvacr industry in general 
we seek to mitigate the impact of higher commodity prices through a combination of price increases  commodity contracts  improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives 
we also partially mitigate volatility in the prices of these commodities by entering into futures contracts and fixed forward contracts 
in  our residential businesses benefited from various government tax credits  both in the united states and canada  which motivated customers to purchase high efficiency system replacements 
in addition to the reduction of tax credits for high efficiency heating and cooling products in  overall consumer sentiment declined  which resulted in our customers shifting from entire system replacements to replacement of components 
this shift reduced sales volumes and resulted in unfavorable product mix in our residential heating cooling and service experts businesses 
however  we did see a positive shift in volume and mix in our commercial heating cooling segment 
the increase in volume can be attributed to a stronger commercial hvac market in the united states in compared to  as well as organic growth in europe through focused efforts to expand our share in the markets we serve 
our refrigeration business also performed well in and grew both organically and through the kysor warren acquisition 
we acquired kysor warren  a leading manufacturer of refrigerated systems and display cases for supermarkets  from the manitowoc company in january this acquisition extended the value chain for us directly to food retail and supermarket customers 
our margins were negatively affected by product mix in from our residential heating cooling and service experts business discussed above 
adding to the negative effect from mix  commodity prices put a strain on raw material and component costs in all of our hvacr businesses 
we are managing our pricing structure to offset a large portion of our commodity price increases on raw materials 
we believe we are managing our controllable costs well and continue to look for ways to lower this cost structure through manufacturing and sourcing excellence 
company highlights net sales for were  million  compared to  million in and were favorably impacted by the kysor warren acquisition  favorable price and mix in our commercial heating cooling and refrigeration segments  and strong volume growth in commercial heating cooling 
partially offsetting these favorable items was unfavorable volume and mix from our residential heating cooling and service experts segments 
operational income from continuing operations for was million compared to million for the decline in operational income was primarily due to lower volumes in our residential heating cooling and service experts segments and lower margins from increased commodity costs 
table of contents from raw materials and components and lower price and mix from our residential heating cooling segment 
net income for was million compared to million in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was per share in compared to per share in we generated million of cash flow from operating activities in compared to million in during  we returned million to shareholders through share repurchases

our price and mix were up while sales volume was down in the comparable period 
the decline in volume was predominantly in our residential heating cooling and service experts segments  partially offset by volume growth in our commercial heating cooling 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net sales by 
excluding the favorable impact from the kysor warren acquisition and foreign currency exchange rates  our net sales for were down compared to 
table of contents gross profit gross profit margins declined million compared to  resulting in a basis point decline to for  compared to gross profit margins of in the impact from commodity costs on both raw material and components contributed approximately basis points to the decline with freight and distribution contributing basis points to the decline in gross profit margin 
price and mix were neutral to gross profit as our price increases in offset the margin declines from product mix 
additionally  the kysor warren acquisition has negatively impacted our gross profit margin by approximately basis points in due to lower margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general administrative sg a expenses decreased by million in compared to  and as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses declined to in from in excluding the kysor warren acquisition  the decrease in sg a was principally due to a million decline in variable compensation  as well as an additional million from general cost control initiatives

additionally  charges included the relocation of a research and development facility and administrative offices from california to tennessee in our residential heating cooling segment 
the remaining restructuring charges from were minor charges from various open projects initiated in and prior years 
refer to note in notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
impairment of assets and goodwill impairment due to the prolonged uncertainty in the recovery of the residential new construction market  our long term outlook for our hearth reporting unit declined 
as a result  we began to pursue strategic alternatives for this 
table of contents reporting unit 
our hearth reporting unit is heavily dependent on the residential new construction market  more so than our other reporting units due to its product offerings fireplaces  stoves and venting products 
as a result of our lowered expectations for this reporting unit  we determined that our long lived assets and goodwill should be tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of as a result of these impairments tests  we recorded million in long lived asset impairments and million in goodwill impairment in we also recorded million in machinery and equipment impairment for assets that are no longer in use 
no impairment charges were recorded in income from equity method investments investments over which we do not exercise control but have significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
income from equity method investments decreased slightly to million in as compared to million in interest expense  net interest expense  net increased to million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the issuance of million in senior unsecured notes in may of at a higher fixed interest rate of and higher average domestic credit facility borrowings resulting from the kysor warren acquisition

changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net sales by 
gross profit gross profit margins improved approximately basis points to for  compared to gross profit margins of in this improvement was primarily driven by lower product costs from material savings and manufacturing efficiencies of approximately basis points 
gross profit margin comparisons were also favorably impacted by basis points for expenses related to a product quality issue that were recorded in with no such expenses in partially offsetting these positive impacts to gross profit margins were commodities headwinds of basis points and increased freight and distribution expenses that decreased gross profit margins by approximately basis points  primarily in the residential heating cooling segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased by million in as compared to  and as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were down basis points from in to in sg a expenses increased million due to increased variable incentive compensation driven by improved financial performance and million related to increased variable selling  advertising  and promotion expenses in support of our sales growth

liquidity and capital resources our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through internally generated funds  bank lines of credit and an asset securitization arrangement 
working capital needs are generally greater in the first and second quarters due to the seasonal nature of our business cycle 
statement of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for  and in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this decrease was due to lower net income  an unfavorable change in working capital  and an unfavorable change in

the unfavorable comparison for accrued expenses was due to higher payments and lower accruals for incentive compensation in versus incentive compensation is accrued in the current year based on performance  but paid in the first quarter of the subsequent year 
in addition  we had an increase in accrued expenses related to class action litigation in but a significant reduction in when substantially all of these accrued expenses were paid 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for included million for the acquisition of the kysor warren business from the manitowoc company and million for the acquisition of a commercial services business in our service experts segment 
kysor warren is a leading manufacturer of refrigerated systems and display cases for supermarkets throughout north america and is included in our refrigeration segment 
offsetting the cash used in was a change in the security requirements for our captive insurance subsidiary 
we transferred substantially all security from restricted cash to stand by letters of credit resulting in a release of million of restricted cash 
investing activities from included a net purchase of a business for million and restricted cash of million for security requirements for our captive insurance subsidiary 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in were primarily investments in our distribution network  investments in systems and software to support the overall enterprise  and investments for manufacturing and sourcing excellence 
net cash used in financing activities net borrowings of long term debt  short term debt and revolving long term debt totaled approximately million in compared to net borrowings of million in during  we used approximately million to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock compared to million for million shares of our common stock during under our share repurchase plans 
debt position and financial leverage the following table details our lines of credit and financing arrangements as of december  maximum capacity outstanding borrowings available for future borrowings short term debt foreign obligations committed non committed asset securitization total short term debt current maturities capital lease obligations long term debt capital lease obligations domestic revolving credit facility senior unsecured notes total long term debt total the maximum capacity under the receivables purchase agreement rpa is the lesser of million or of the net pool balance less reserves  as defined under the rpa 
the available future borrowings on our domestic revolving credit facility exclude million in standby letters of credit 

table of contents as discussed above  we utilized our domestic revolving credit facility credit facility to support the acquisition of the kysor warren business 
we believe our available future borrowings combined with our cash of million and future cash from operations is sufficient to fund our operations  planned capital expenditures  future contractual obligations  share repurchases  anticipated dividends and other needs 
our expected capital expenditures are approximately million for additionally  we expect to make approximately million in contributions to our us defined benefit plan in our debt to total capital ratio increased to at december  compared to at december  the increase in the ratio is due to the increase in debt since december   primarily related to the acquisition of the kysor warren business in january we periodically review our capital structure  including our primary bank facility  to ensure that it has adequate liquidity 
we amended our rpa on november  and amended and restated our credit facility on october  the most significant changes to the rpa were the addition of allied air enterprises llc  heatcraft refrigeration products llc  and lennox hearth products llc  all wholly owned subsidiaries  as sellers of trade accounts receivable under the program  an increase in the purchase limit to million from million  and the extension of the rpa to november  the amended credit facility provides up to million in unsecured borrowings and issuance of letters of credit up to the full amount of the facility 
the maturity date was extended to october  additionally  at our request and subject to certain conditions  the commitments under the credit facility may be increased by a maximum of million as long as existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments 
although pricing under the amended facility is slightly higher  we do not believe it will significantly increase our interest expense on an annual basis 
we also periodically consider various other financing alternatives and may  from time to time  seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions  which may include accessing the capital markets 
on march   we announced that our board of directors approved a increase in our quarterly dividend on common stock from to effective with the april dividend payment 
dividend payments were approximately million in we also continue to increase shareholder value through our share repurchase program 
in december  our board of directors increased the share repurchase program by million 
utilizing this program  we returned million to our investors through share repurchases 
we are targeting approximately million in share repurchases in our credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to leverage and interest coverage 
other covenants contained in the credit facility restrict  among other things  certain mergers  asset dispositions  guarantees  debt  liens  and affiliate transactions 
the financial covenants require us to maintain a defined consolidated indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ratio and a cash flow defined as ebitda minus capital expenditures to net interest expense ratio 
the required ratios under our credit facility are detailed below consolidated indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ratio no greater than cash flow to net interest expense ratio no less than our credit facility contains customary events of default 
these events of default include nonpayment of principal or interest  breach of covenants or other restrictions or requirements  default on certain other indebtedness or receivables securitizations cross default  and bankruptcy 
a cross default under our credit facility could occur if we fail to pay any principal or interest when due on any other indebtedness or receivables securitization of at least million  or we are in default in the performance of  or compliance with any term of any other indebtedness or receivables securitization in an aggregate principal amount of at least million  or any other condition exists which would give the holders the right to declare such indebtedness due and payable prior to its stated maturity 
each of our major debt agreements contains provisions by which a default under one agreement causes a default in the others a cross default 
if a cross default under the credit facility  our senior unsecured notes  or 
table of contents our rpa were to occur  it could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise occur from a default of a single debt instrument or lease commitment 
if any event of default occurs and is continuing  lenders with a majority of the aggregate commitments may require the administrative agent to terminate our right to borrow under our credit facility and accelerate amounts due under our credit facility except for a bankruptcy event of default  in which case such amounts will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments will automatically terminate 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements 
upon a change of control  holders of our senior unsecured notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the senior unsecured notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
the notes are guaranteed  on a senior unsecured basis  by each of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee payment by us of any indebtedness under our credit facility 
the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability and the ability of the subsidiary guarantors to create or incur certain liens  enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions  enter into certain mergers  consolidations and transfers of substantially all of our assets  and transfer certain properties 
the indenture also contains a cross default provision which is triggered if we default on other debt of at least million in principal which is then accelerated  and such acceleration is not rescinded within days of the notice date 
during the third quarter of  we amended the lease agreement for our corporate headquarters 
while the same party continues to be the lessor under the lease  the amendment  among other things  replaced the debt participant and moderately increased the rent payments 
the amendment also provides for financial covenants consistent with our credit agreement and we are in compliance with these financial covenants 
the lease is accounted for as an operating lease 
during  we expanded our tifton  georgia manufacturing facility using the proceeds from industrial development bonds idbs 
we entered into a lease agreement with the owner of the property and the issuer of the idbs  and through our lease payments fund the interest payments to investors in the idbs 
we also guaranteed the repayment of the idbs and entered into letters of credit totaling million to fund a potential repurchase of the idbs in the event investors exercised their right to tender the idbs to the trustee 
as of december  and  we recorded both a long term asset and a corresponding long term obligation of million related to these transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the credit facilities and promissory notes described above  we also lease real estate and machinery and equipment pursuant to operating leases that are not capitalized on the balance sheet  including high turnover equipment such as autos and service vehicles and short lived equipment such as personal computers 
rent expense for these leases was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
contractual obligations summarized below are our contractual obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period total year or less years years after years total long term debt obligations operating leases uncertain tax positions purchase obligations total contractual obligations as of december   the liability for uncertain tax positions includes interest and penalties 
purchase obligations consist of aluminum commitments and inventory that is part of our third party logistics program 
the 
table of contents above table does not include retirement  postretirement and warranty liabilities because it is not certain when these liabilities will be funded  however  we expect to pay approximately million in contributions to our us defined benefit plan in contractual obligations related to capital leases as of december  were included as part of long term debt in the table above

fair value measurements fair value hierarchy the three level fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements is defined as follows level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets at the measurement date and for the anticipated term of the instrument 
level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
fair value techniques general our valuation techniques are applied to all of the assets and liabilities carried at fair value 
where available  the fair values are based upon quoted prices in active markets 
however  if quoted prices are not available  then the fair values are based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or independently sourced market parameters  such as credit default swap spreads  yield curves  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  interest rates and benchmark securities 
for assets and liabilities with a lack of observable market activity  if any  the fair values are based upon discounted cash flow methodologies incorporating assumptions that  in our judgment  reflect the assumptions a marketplace participant would use 
to ensure that financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value  valuation adjustments may be required to reflect either party s creditworthiness and ability to pay 
where appropriate  these amounts were incorporated into our valuations as of december  and  the measurement dates 
derivatives derivatives are primarily valued using estimated future cash flows that are based directly on observed prices from exchange traded derivatives and  therefore  were classified as level we also take into account the counterparty s creditworthiness  or our own creditworthiness  as appropriate 
an adjustment has been recorded in order to reflect the risk of credit default  but these adjustments have been insignificant to the overall value of the derivatives 
pension plan assets the majority of our commingled pool collective trust  mutual funds and balanced pension trusts are managed by professional investment advisors 
the net asset values nav per share are furnished in monthly and or quarterly statements received from the investment advisors and reflect valuations based upon their pricing policies 
we have assessed the classification of the inputs used to value these investments at level for mutual funds and level for commingled pool collective trusts and balance pension trusts through examination of their pricing policies and the related controls and procedures 
the fair values we report are based on the pool or trust s 
table of contents nav per share 
the nav s per share are calculated periodically daily or no less than one time per month as the aggregate value of each pool or trust s underlying assets divided by the number of units owned 
market risk commodity price risk we enter into commodity futures contracts to stabilize prices expected to be paid for raw materials and parts containing high copper and aluminum content 
these contracts are for quantities equal to or less than quantities expected to be consumed in future production 
fluctuations in metal commodity prices impact the value of the derivative instruments that we hold 
when metal commodity prices rise  the fair value of our futures contracts increases and conversely  when commodity prices fall  the fair value of our futures contracts decreases 
information about our exposure to market risks related to metal commodity prices and a sensitivity analysis related to our metal commodity hedges is presented below in millions notional amount pounds carrying amount and fair value of asset change in fair value from change in forward prices interest rate risk our results of operations can be affected by changes in interest rates due to variable rates of interest on our revolving credit facilities  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in order to partially mitigate interest rate risk  we use a hedging strategy to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the interest payments for the first million of the total variable rate debt outstanding under the credit facility that is solely due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
this strategy allows us to fix a portion of our interest payments while also taking advantage of historically low interest rates 
on june   we entered into a million pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap with a large financial institution at a fixed interest rate of 
the variable portion of the interest rate swap is tied to month libor the benchmark interest rate 
the interest rates under both the interest rate swap and the underlying debt are reset  the swap is settled with the counterparty  and interest is paid  on a monthly basis 
the interest rate swap expires october  we account for the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge 
information about our exposure to interest rate risk and a sensitivity analysis related to our interest rate swap is presented below in millions notional amount impact of a basis point change in the benchmark interest rate carrying amount and fair value of liability interest expense foreign currency exchange rate risk our results of operations can be affected by changes in exchange rates 
net sales and expenses in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes based on the average exchange rate for the period 
during  and  net sales from outside the us represented  and  respectively  of our total net sales 
historically  foreign currency transaction gains losses have not had a material effect on our overall operations 
as of december   the impact to net income of a change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
the critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our judgments about future 
table of contents events and related estimations and how such policies can impact our financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that requires difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the results of operations 
we consider our most critical accounting policies to be goodwill and other intangible assets  product warranties  pension and postretirement benefits  self insurance expense  derivative accounting  and income taxes 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in
