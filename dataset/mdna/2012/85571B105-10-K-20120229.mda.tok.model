item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview starwood property trust  inc together with its subsidiaries  the company is a maryland corporation that commenced operations on august  upon completion of our initial public offering 
we are focused on originating  investing in  financing and managing commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate debt investments  commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs  and other commercial real estate related debt investments 
we also invest in residential mortgage backed securities rmbs  and may invest in commercial properties subject to net leases and residential mortgage loans 
we collectively refer to commercial mortgage loans  other commercial real estate debt investments  cmbs  other commercial real estate related debt investments  commercial properties subject to net leases  and residential mortgage loans as our target assets 
our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted global returns to our investors over the long term  primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation 
we employ leverage  to the extent available  to fund the acquisition of our target assets and to increase potential returns to our stockholders 
in order to achieve these objectives  we are focusing on asset selection and the relative value of various sectors within the debt market to construct a diversified investment portfolio designed 
table of contents to produce attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles 
we are organized as a holding company that conducts its business primarily through its various subsidiaries 
since the closing of our initial public offering in august  we have focused primarily on opportunities that exist in the us commercial mortgage loan  commercial real estate debt  and cmbs and rmbs markets 
as market conditions change over time  we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of changes in interest rates and credit spreads as well as economic and credit conditions 
we believe that the diversification of our portfolio of assets  our expertise among the target asset classes  and the flexibility of our strategy will position us to generate attractive risk adjusted returns for our stockholders in a variety of assets and market conditions 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes  commencing with our initial taxable year ended december  we also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the act 
for the year ended december   we had entered into agreements or consummated transactions representing net investments of approximately billion 
our primary business is originating and acquiring commercial mortgage related loans and securities 
during the twelve months ended december   we acquired and originated commercial mortgage loans with an original carrying value of approximately billion  which included the following significant items i a million origination of a first mortgage loan  mezzanine loan and corporate loan on a portfolio of six full service hotels located throughout california  ii an acquisition of a interest in a million face amount mezzanine loan collateralized by an ownership interest in a portfolio of ten office buildings in northern virginia for million  iii an acquisition of a million face amount mezzanine loan tranche collateralized by ownership interests in hotels located throughout the us for million  iv an origination of a million first mortgage collateralized by a furniture showroom located in north carolina  v an origination of a million first mortgage loan secured by two retail centers in pennsylvania  vi an origination of a million first mortgage loan secured by a multi family apartment property located in virginia  vii a discounted acquisition from a top tier international bank of a portfolio of separate commercial mortgage loans with a face value of million  and viii an acquisition of a million a note secured by a portfolio of limited service hotels 
we also invested million in rmbs and million in other investments 
in addition  refer to significant events occurring subsequent to december  in note to the consolidated financial statements 
business objectives and outlook our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our investors over the long term  primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation 
we intend to achieve this objective by directly originating and acquiring target assets to construct a diversified investment portfolio designed to produce attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles 
we intend to construct a diversified investment portfolio by focusing on our three core competencies transaction access  asset analysis and selection  and identification of attractive relative values within the real estate debt and equity markets 
in the last decade  real estate became significantly overpriced as values appreciated well beyond their underlying fundamentals 
following a dramatic correction in the price of real estate over the past several years  including a nearly complete shut down of the real estate capital markets producing a void of debt and equity capital availability for real estate investing  the real estate capital markets have begun what we believe will be a slow return to a rationally priced and liquid marketplace 
securitization markets have reappeared 
bank and non bank finance companies have begun to lend again on commercial real estate  albeit at more conservative leverage levels and with more conservative underwriting parameters and assumptions 
commercial real estate values  particularly in gateway cities  have begun to improve as have real estate operating fundamentals in some sectors and geographic areas 

table of contents since our initial public offering  we capitalized on the dislocation in the credit markets and lack of existing capital  investing in over billion of real estate debt at what we believe are attractive risk adjusted returns 
as the market recovery continues and competition from both traditional and new lending sources increases  our business plan is evolving away from a focus on the acquisition of assets from distressed sellers to that of a commercial real estate finance platform focused on the direct origination of real estate debt in all parts of the capital structure in both the us and abroad 
more specifically  in the months and years ahead  we intend to exploit this recovery in four primary ways continue to opportunistically acquire distressed investment opportunities from lender sellers and equity sponsors as they continue to address the problems associated with the large overhang of significantly overleveraged and undercapitalized real estate projects  provide debt and equity capital to what should be an increasing supply of moderately overleveraged and undercapitalized real estate projects in need of recapitalization as their current loans come due  opportunistically provide acquisition  refinance  development and expansion capital to new real estate projects in infill locations and or attractive market niches  and utilize the syndication and securitization markets as a source of attractively priced  matched term off balance sheet financing 
there can be no assurance that the recovery will continue or that we will be able to find appropriate investment opportunities 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made  based upon information available to us at that time 
in accordance with sec guidance  the following discussion describes the accounting policies that apply to our operations that we believe to be most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment and the use of estimates 
this summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
classification and impairment evaluation of investment securities our mbs investments consist primarily of commercial real estate debt instruments  cmbs  and rmbs that we classify as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are carried at their fair value  with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  rather than through earnings 
we do not hold any of our investment securities for trading purposes 
when the estimated fair value of a security is less than amortized cost  we consider whether there is an other than temporary impairment otti in the value of the security 
an impairment is deemed an otti if i we intend to sell the security  ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis  or iii we do not expect to recover our cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security or believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis 
if the impairment is deemed to be an otti  the resulting accounting treatment depends on the factors causing the otti 
if the otti has resulted from i our intention to sell the security or ii our judgment that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis  an impairment loss is 
table of contents recognized in current earnings equal to the difference between our amortized cost basis and fair value 
whereas  if the otti has resulted from our conclusion that we will not recover our cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security or believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis  the credit loss portion of the impairment is recorded in current earnings and the portion of the loss related to other factors  such as changes in interest rates  continues to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
determining whether there is an otti may require management to exercise significant judgment and make significant assumptions  including  but not limited to  estimated cash flows  estimated prepayments  loss assumptions  and assumptions regarding changes in interest rates 
as a result  actual impairment losses could differ from reported amounts 
such judgments and assumptions are based upon a number of factors  including i credit of the issuer or the borrower  ii credit rating of the security  iii key terms of the security  iv performance of the loan or underlying loans  including debt service coverage and loan to value ratios  v the value of the collateral for the loan or underlying loans  vi the effect of local  industry  and broader economic factors  and vii the historical and anticipated trends in defaults and loss severities for similar securities 
loan impairment we evaluate each loan classified as held for investment for impairment at least quarterly 
impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
if a loan is considered to be impaired  we record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral  if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the company s loans are typically collateralized by real estate 
as a result  the company regularly evaluates the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and or value of the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower sponsor on a loan by loan basis 
specifically  a property s operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess i whether cash from operations are sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future  ii the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan  and or iii the property s liquidation value 
the company also evaluates the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower s competency in managing and operating the properties 
in addition  the company considers the overall economic environment  real estate sector  and geographic sub market in which the borrower operates 
such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel  who utilize various data sources  including i periodic financial data such as property occupancy  tenant profile  rental rates  operating expenses  the borrower s exit plan  and capitalization and discount rates  ii site inspections  and iii current credit spreads and discussions with market participants 
upon completion of the process above  we concluded that no loans were impaired as of december  or significant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment  therefore  actual results over time could be materially different 
valuation of financial instruments gaap establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the observability of inputs utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair values 
gaap establishes market based or observable inputs as the preferred source of values  followed by valuation models using management assumptions in the absence of market inputs 
the three levels of the hierarchy under gaap are described below level i quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

table of contents level ii prices are determined using other significant observable inputs 
observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing a security 
these may include quoted prices for similar securities  interest rates  prepayment speeds  credit risk and others 
level iii prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs 
in situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable for example  when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period unobservable inputs may be used 
unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  and would be based on the best information available 
any changes to the valuation methodology are be reviewed by management to ensure the changes are appropriate 
the methods we use may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values 
furthermore  while we anticipate that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies  or assumptions  to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
we use inputs that are current as of the measurement date  which may include periods of market dislocation  during which price transparency may be reduced 
derivative instruments and hedging activities as required by gaap  the company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether the company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risks  even though hedge accounting does not apply or we do not elect to apply hedge accounting 
the designation of derivative contracts as hedges  the measurement of their effectiveness  and the estimate of the fair value of the contracts all may involve significant judgments by our management  and changes to those judgments could significantly impact our reported results of operations 
income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code for federal income tax purposes 
we generally must distribute annually at least of our taxable income  subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain  in order for federal corporate income tax not to apply to our earnings that we distribute 
to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
our qualification as a reit also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the code  which relate to organizational structure  diversity of stock ownership and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income 
many of the reit requirements are highly technical and complex  and if we fail to qualify as a reit we would be subject to united states federal corporate income tax on our taxable income 

table of contents the company formed several trss in to reduce the impact of the prohibited transaction tax and to avoid penalty for the holding of assets not qualifying as real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests 
any income associated with a trs is fully taxable because a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes as a domestic c corporation based upon its taxable income 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreements 
this update revises the criteria for assessing effective control for repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity 
the update will be effective for the company on january   early adoption is prohibited  and the amendments will be applied prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after the effective date 
we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this update amends the existing fair value guidance to improve consistency in the application and disclosure of fair value measurements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu provides certain clarifications to the existing guidance  changes certain fair value principles  and enhances disclosure requirements 
the update will be effective for the company on january   early adoption is prohibited  and the amendments will be applied prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after the effective date 
we have not completed our evaluation as to whether the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued amended guidance which will enhance disclosures required by us gaap by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement  irrespective of whether they are offset 
this information will enable users of an entity s financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity s financial position  including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments 
an entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statement disclosures 
results of operations net income attributable to starwood property trust  inc for the year ended december  was approximately million or per weighted average share of basic common stock diluted  more than double the million or per weighted average share of basic common stock diluted for the year ended december  the net loss for the period ended december  was million or a loss of per weighted average share of basic and diluted common stock 
for the purposes of this analysis  the period ended december  is excluded as it represents approximately four months of operating activity and is not comparable with and for the year ended december   net interest margin increased million from the prior year  resulting from increases in interest income of million and interest expense of million 
the increase in net interest margin is primarily due to increased investment activity 
from december  to december   the carrying value of our investments in loans increased a net billion  other investments increased a net million and mbs securities decreased by million 
the 
table of contents increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the four new financing facilities entered into since december   with a resulting increase in the total secured financing balance outstanding of million 
as of december   our target portfolio of investments was generating a weighted average levered return of annually compounded and the weighted average cost of the secured financings was  including the impact of interest rate hedges 
for the year ended december   non investment expenses increased by million from the prior year 
the year over year increases were primarily due to increases in the base management fee of million  stock compensation expense of million  acquisition and investment pursuit costs of million and general and administrative costs of million 
the increase in the base management fee was primarily due to our supplemental equity raises in december and may with net proceeds of million and million  respectively 
in connection with the december supplemental equity raise  our manager was granted an additional  restricted stock units  resulting in higher stock compensation expense in the subsequent periods 
the increase in acquisition and investment pursuit costs and general and administrative expenses are primarily attributed to the company s increased size  as well as the volume of transactions and the increase in professional fees such as legal  audit and consulting  resulting from the growing investment portfolio 
for the year ended december   we had realized gains from the sale of investments of million  of which million related to the sale of mbs securities and other investments and million related to the sale of loans 
for the year ended december   we had realized gains from the sale of investments of million  of which million related to the sale of mbs and other investments and million related to the sale of loans 
realized gains from mbs and other investments primarily relate to strategic sales of rmbs and cmbs in and in  we sold seven loans into two separate securitization vehicles and sold two loans in a private sale and in  sold three loans into a securitization vehicle  representing the realized gains on loans for each year  respectively 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for more information on loan securitization and sale activities 
for the year ended december   we had net gains on currency hedges of million and unrealized foreign currency remeasurement loss of million  compared to net losses on currency hedges of million and unrealized foreign currency remeasurement gain of million from the prior year 
the flip in the currency hedge and foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses year over year was primarily due to volatility and the depreciation of the euro on our euro denominated loan as a result of the european sovereign debt crisis in for the year ended december   we had net losses on interest rate hedges of million and net gains on credit spread hedges of million 
we have historically used the securitization markets as a source of advantageously priced  non recourse  matched term financing for many of the fixed rate first mortgage loans we originate 
our business model is to originate the whole loan and either securitize or sell a senior portion of the loan  leaving us with a higher yielding subordinate loan component 
earlier in  in an effort to improve the competitive position of our growing direct origination platform  we also began originating sell all fixed rate conduit loans where the entire balance of the loan was targeted for sale into the securitization markets 
the losses on interest rate hedges stem from declines in the value of our held for sale conduit loans and related derivatives that resulted from the extreme disruption experienced by the cmbs market since late june and have suspended our conduit platform as a result 
as of december   we had six held for sale conduit loans remaining that were in an unrealized gain position of million 
otti charges related to our rmbs securities were million for the year ended december  and other income was million 

table of contents the diluted per share amounts of our interest margin and expenses for the years ended december  and and the period ended december  were as follows amounts in thousands except per share data for the year ended for the period ended per diluted share per diluted share per diluted share net interest margin cash coupon received from loans constant yield adjustments on loans cash coupon received from mortgage backed securities constant yield adjustments on mortgage backed securities cash interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs net interest margin expenses management fees acquisition and investment pursuit costs general and administrative total expenses income before other income expenses and taxes represents the aggregate adjustments necessary to recognize income from loans on a constant yield basis  which is comprised primarily of discount accretion  but also includes the amortization of loan fees and costs 
represents the aggregate adjustments necessary to recognize income from mbs on a constant yield basis  which is comprised primarily of discount accretion 
the overall increase in net interest margin for over the three year period is due to the more full deployment of our capital during each year 
management fees per diluted share for and are higher than due to our manager earning an incentive fee in those years 
acquisition and investment pursuit costs per diluted share have increased during the three periods due to the increased size volume of transactions being pursued 
general and administrative expenses per diluted share decreased in from as a result of our efforts to control costs such that our overhead related costs have not increased proportionately with the equity that has been raised 
cash flows for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during the year ended december  the decrease resulted from cash used in investing activities of billion  offset by cash provided from operating activities of million and financing activities of million 

table of contents net cash provided from operating activities for the year ended december  of approximately million  includes million used for the origination of loans held for sale and million in proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale

in addition  proceeds from our december supplemental common stock offering of million were offset by the payment of dividends to our shareholders of million  repayments on borrowings of million  payment of underwriting and offering costs of million  payment of million in deferred financing costs  and net distributions to non controlling interests of million 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain our assets and operations  make new investments where appropriate  make distributions to our stockholders  and other general business needs 
we use cash to purchase or originate investments  repay principal and interest on our borrowings  make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations 
we closely monitor our liquidity position and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to and access to liquidity to meet our financial obligations for at least the next months 
our primary sources of liquidity are as follows cash generated from operating the business  including repayments cash from operations is generally comprised of interest income from our investments  net of any associated financing expense  principal repayments from our investments  net of associated financing repayments  proceeds from the sale of investments  and changes in working capital balances 
cash and cash equivalents as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  including million related to borrower reserve funds maintained in an unrestricted account 
potential liquidation of certain rmbs and cmbs positions we regularly make certain investments in rmbs 
we have restricted these rmbs investments to an amount that at all times is no greater than of our total assets 
expected durations are generally years or less and we have engaged a third party manager who specializes in rmbs to assist us in managing this portfolio 
as of december   our investments in rmbs and cmbs are classified as available for sale and had a fair value of million and million  respectively 
borrowings under various financing arrangements we utilize a variety of financing arrangements to finance certain assets 
we generally utilize three types of financing arrangements repurchase agreements repurchase agreements effectively allow us to borrow against loans and securities that we own 
under these agreements  we sell our loans and securities to a 
table of contents counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor 
the counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan and security from us and  subject to certain conditions  the market value of such loan or security for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty 
generally  if the lender determines subject to certain conditions that the market value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount  we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of i the revised market value multiplied by ii the applicable advance rate 
during the term of a repurchase agreement  we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and securities and pay interest to the counterparty 
as of december   we have various repurchase agreements  with details referenced in the table provided below 
bank credit facilities we use bank credit facilities including term loans and revolving facilities to finance our assets 
these financings may be collateralized or non collateralized and may involve one or more lenders 
credit facilities typically have maturities ranging from two to five years and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates 
on december   we entered into a term loan credit agreement with bank of america  na bank of america to finance the acquisition of a million participation in a senior secured note  due from certain special purpose entities that were formed to hold substantially all of the assets of a worldwide operator of hotels  resorts and timeshare properties 
in june  we exercised a pre existing right to convert the note into securities in order to maximize the liquidity of our investment 
we therefore reclassified the loan  which had a carrying amount of million  from loans held for investment to mbs  available for sale  at fair value 
the initial term of our bank facility  as stated in the table below  is subject to further extension based upon the satisfaction of certain conditions at or prior to the time of such extension 
bank of america retains the sole discretion  subject to certain conditions  over the market value of such note for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the bank of america 
loan sales syndications securitizations we seek non recourse long term financing from loan sales  syndications and or securitizations of our investments in mortgage loans 
the sales syndications securitizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan  but may involve the entire loan 
loan sales and syndications generally involve the sale of a senior note component or participation interest to a third party lender 
securitization generally involves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle or the issuing entity  which then issues one or more classes of non recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture 
the notes are secured by the pool of assets 
in exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity  we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non recourse notes 
sales syndications securitizations of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate interest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would  therefore  absorb all losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect to the loan in question

we may also seek to raise further equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments 
leverage policies we employ leverage  to the extent available  to fund the acquisition of our target assets  increase potential returns to our stockholders  or provide temporary liquidity 
leverage can be either direct by utilizing private third party financing  or indirect through originating  acquiring  or retaining subordinated mortgages  b notes  subordinated loan participations or mezzanine loans 
although the type of leverage we deploy is dependent on the underlying asset that is being financed  we intend  when possible  to utilize leverage whose maturity is equal to or greater than the maturity of the underlying asset and minimize to the greatest extent possible exposure to the company of credit losses associated with any individual asset 
in addition  we intend to mitigate the impact of potential future interest rate increases on our borrowings through utilization of hedging instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements 
the amount of leverage we deploy for particular investments in our target assets depends upon our manager s assessment of a variety of factors  which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio  the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio  the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities  including hedges  the availability and cost of financing the assets  our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties  the health of the us economy and commercial and residential mortgage markets  our outlook for the level  slope  and volatility of interest rates  the credit quality of our assets  the collateral underlying our assets  and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the libor curve

further  as of december   we had not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities 
dividends we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock 
us federal income tax law generally requires that a reit distribute annually at least of its reit taxable income  without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains  and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than of its net taxable income 
we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders in an amount approximating our net taxable income  if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors 
before we pay any dividend  whether for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise  we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt 
if our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income  we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities 
our board of directors declared a dividend of per share of common stock for the quarter ended march  on march  the dividend was paid on april  to common stockholders of record as of march  the board also declared a dividend of per share of common stock for the quarter ended june  the dividend was paid on july  to common stockholders of record as of june  the board further declared a dividend of per share of common stock for the quarter ended september  the dividend was paid on october  to common stockholders of record as of september  on november   the board declared a dividend of per share of common stock for the quarter ended december  the dividend was paid on january  to common stockholders of record as of december

on february   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share for the first quarter of  which is payable on april  to common stockholders of record as of march  non gaap financial measures core earnings is a non gaap financial measure 
we calculate core earnings as gaap net income loss excluding non cash equity compensation expense  the incentive fee due under our management agreement  depreciation and amortization of real estate to the extent that we own properties  any unrealized gains  losses or other non cash items recorded in net income for the period  regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss  or in net income 
the amount is adjusted to exclude one time events pursuant to changes in gaap and certain other non cash charges as determined by our manager and approved by a majority of our independent directors 
we believe that core earnings provides an additional measure of our core operating performance by eliminating the impact of certain non cash expenses and facilitating a comparison of our financial results to those of other comparable reits with fewer or no non cash charges and comparison of our own operating results from period to period 
our management uses core earnings in this way  and also uses core earnings to compute the incentive fee due under our management agreement 
the company believes that its investors also use core earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of the company and its peers  and as such  the company believes that the disclosure of core earnings is useful to and expected by its investors 
however  the company cautions that core earnings does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  or an indication of our cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  a measure of our liquidity  or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
in addition  our methodology for calculating core earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other reits to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures  and accordingly  our reported core earnings may not be comparable to the core earnings reported by other reits

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets  interest rates  liquidity  prepayment speeds and market value while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk adjusted returns through ownership of our capital stock 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and seek to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
credit risk we are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our investments 
while we do not expect to encounter significant credit risk in our agency rmbs assets  we have exposure to credit risk on the mortgage assets and underlying mortgage loans in our non agency rmbs and cmbs portfolios as well as other assets 
our manager seeks to manage credit risk by performing deep credit fundamental analysis of potential assets 
credit risk is also addressed through our manager s on going surveillance  and investments are monitored for variance from expected prepayments  defaults  severities  losses and cash flow on a monthly basis 
our investment guidelines do not limit the amount of our equity that may be invested in any type of our target assets  however  not more than of our equity may be invested in any individual asset  without the consent of a majority of our independent directors 
our investment decisions depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different interest rate  economic and credit environments 
as a result  we cannot predict the percentage of our equity that will be invested in any of our target assets at any given time

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments and the related financing obligations 
in general  we finance the acquisition and or origination of our target assets through financings in the form of warehouse facilities  bank credit facilities including term loans and revolving facilities  securitizations and repurchase agreements 
we mitigate interest rate risk through utilization of hedging instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate swap agreements are utilized to hedge against future interest rate increases on our borrowings and potential adverse changes in the value of certain assets that result from interest rate changes 
interest rate effect on net interest margin our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our investments and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities 
the cost of our borrowings is generally based on prevailing market interest rates 
during a period of rising interest rates  our borrowing costs generally may increase while the yields earned on our leveraged fixed rate mortgage assets remain static and at a faster pace than the yields earned on our leveraged floating rate mortgage assets  which could result in a decline in our net interest margin 
the severity of any such decline would depend on our asset liability composition at the time as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase 
further  an increase in short term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our target assets 
if any of these events happen  we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods  which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our investments 
if prepayments are slower or faster than assumed  the life of the investment would be longer or shorter  which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions 
interest rate mismatch risk we have funded a portion of our acquisition of mortgage loans and mbs with borrowings that are based on libor  while the interest rates on these assets may be indexed to libor or another index rate  such as the one year constant maturity treasury cmt index  the monthly treasury average mta index or the th district cost of funds index cofi 
accordingly  any increase in libor relative to one year cmt rates  mta or cofi may result in an increase in our borrowing costs that may not be matched by a corresponding increase in the interest earnings on these assets 
any such interest rate index mismatch could adversely affect our profitability  which may negatively impact distributions to our stockholders 
to mitigate interest rate mismatches  we may utilize the hedging strategies discussed above 
our analysis of risks is based on our manager s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions by the manager may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results 
prepayment risk prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated  causing the return on certain investments to be less than expected 
as we receive prepayments of principal on our assets  any premiums paid on such assets are amortized against interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets 
conversely  discounts on such assets are accreted into interest income 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the accretion of purchase discounts  thereby increasing the interest income earned on the assets 

table of contents extension risk our manager computes the projected weighted average life of our assets based on assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the mortgages or extend 
if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment or extension options are exercised  the life of the fixed rate assets could extend beyond the term of the secured debt agreements 
this could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
in some situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur losses 
fair value risk the estimated fair value of our investments fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of the fixed rate investments would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of the fixed rate investments would be expected to increase 
as market volatility increases or liquidity decreases  the fair value of our assets may be adversely impacted 
if we are unable to readily obtain independent pricing to validate our estimated fair value of the securities in our portfolio  the fair value gains or losses recorded and or disclosed may be adversely affected 
foreign currency risk we intend to hedge our currency exposures in a prudent manner 
however  our currency hedging strategies may not eliminate all of our currency risk due to  among other things  uncertainties in the timing and or amount of payments received on the related investments  and or unequal  inaccurate  or unavailability of hedges to perfectly offset changes in future exchange rates 
additionally  we may be required under certain circumstances to collateralize our currency hedges for the benefit of the hedge counterparty  which could adversely affect our liquidity 
as of december   we had million of gbp denominated loan investments using the december  spot rate of 
our historical cost related to these investments was at a spot rate of approximately

real estate commercial and residential mortgage assets are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  age and design  demographic factors  and retroactive changes to building or similar codes 
in addition  decreases in 
table of contents property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
inflation risk virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does 
changes in interest rates may correlate with inflation rates and or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our distributions are determined by our board of directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income on an annual basis in order to maintain our reit qualification  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and or fair value without considering inflation 
risk management to the extent consistent with maintaining our reit qualification  we seek to manage risk exposure to protect our portfolio of financial assets against the effects of major interest rate changes 
we generally seek to manage this risk by attempting to structure our financing agreements to have a range of different maturities  terms  amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods  using hedging instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements but also financial futures  options  interest rate cap agreements  floors and forward sales to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of our investment portfolio and our borrowings  and using loan sales  syndications  and securitization financing to better match the maturity of our financing with the duration of our assets
