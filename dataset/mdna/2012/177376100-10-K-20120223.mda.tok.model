these technologies give workers more control over their work and life  while helping business and it be more flexible and agile 
we believe our approach is unique in the market because we have combined innovative technologies in the area of desktop management  including but not limited to desktop virtualization and application virtualization  marketed as our desktop solutions  and cloud networking and cloud platform products  marketed as our datacenter and cloud solutions  to deliver a comprehensive end to end application delivery solution  and one that we believe  when considered as a whole  is competitively differentiated by its feature set and interoperability 
in today s business environment  however  there is a sharp focus on it products and services that can reduce cost and deliver a quick  tangible return on investment  or roi 
with our customers focused on economic value in technology solutions  we intend to continue highlighting our solutions abilities to reduce it costs  increase business flexibility and deliver roi with a simpler more flexible approach to computing 
we saw uncertainties surrounding it spending  particularly in the european markets  in this trend is expected to continue in as we continue to experience uneven demand in many european countries  especially in the public sector 
this overall economic uncertainty may adversely affect sales of our products and services and may result in longer sales cycles  slower adoption of technologies and increased price competition  particularly in europe 
offsetting the uneven demand in european countries  we continue to see demand growth in the americas and asia pacific regions 
our priorities for are to sustain the long term growth of our businesses around the world by expanding our go to market reach and customer attachment points  enhancing our current products through intelligent integration  licensing and packaging across our product portfolio to deliver simpler  better and more competitive solutions  fostering technological innovation  and engineering excellence  and making selective and strategic acquisitions of technology  talent and or businesses

enterprise division our desktop solutions are built to transform and reduce the cost of traditional desktop management by virtualizing the desktop  with our xendesktop product  and virtualizing applications  with our xenapp product  in a customer s datacenter 
we are moving the delivery of desktops and related applications to an on demand service as opposed to the delivery of a device 
we continue to see growing customer interest in xendesktop and  in addition  by making the xendesktop trade up program a standard program  we are maximizing our xenapp install base and driving continued xendesktop adoption 
further  we are helping customers accelerate the implementation of desktop virtualization enterprise wide through our desktop transformation model 
our desktop transformation model has been enhanced by our acquisition of ringcube  which facilitates user 
table of contents personalization in virtual desktop deployments  and our app dna acquisition  which provides customers a means of analyzing an enterprise s application portfolio  offering deployment guidance and calculating project effort 
our datacenter and cloud solutions  including our cloud networking products and cloud platform products  which include our newly acquired cloudstack and cloudportal products  can alter the traditional economics of the datacenter by providing much greater levels of flexibility of computing resources  especially with respect to servers  by improving application performance and thereby reducing the amount of processing power involved  and allowing easy reconfiguration of servers by allowing storage and network infrastructure to be added in virtually rather than physically 
our cloud networking products are also enhancing our differentiation and driving customer interest around desktop virtualization  as enterprises are finding good leverage in deploying these technologies together 
in  we continued to invest in innovative products and services for the enterprise division through strategic acquisitions

in addition  we continue to grow our online services division by increasing our addressable market geographically and offering products that appeal to a wider range of customers 
to accelerate the european expansion of our online services division  in february  we acquired netviewer ag  or netviewer  a privately held european software as a service  or saas  vendor in collaboration and it services 
netviewer is part of our online services division and is expected to further enable the extension of our saas leadership in europe 
summary of results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   we delivered the following financial performance product license revenue increased to million  license updates revenue increased to million  software as a service revenue increased to million  technical services revenue increased to million  operating income increased to million  and diluted earnings per share increased to 
the increase in our product license revenue was primarily driven by increased sales of our desktop solutions  led by our xendesktop product and increased sales of our datacenter and cloud solutions  led by our netscaler products 
we currently expect our product license revenue to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of the increase in license updates revenue was driven by an increase in subscription advantage renewal sales over our growing subscriber base 
our software as a service revenue increased due to increased sales of our web collaboration services 
the increase in technical services revenue was primarily driven by increased sales of support and consulting services related to our enterprise division s products 
our increase in operating income and diluted earnings per share was driven by our increased revenue as well as operating leverage gained by managing our overall operating expenses 
we currently target that total revenue 
table of contents will increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of  as well as when comparing the fiscal year to the fiscal year 
in addition  consistent with the growth we are experiencing in our business  we also currently target that total operating expenses will increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of  as well as when comparing the fiscal year to the fiscal year 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our net revenues have fluctuated quarterly and have generally been the highest in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends 
this seasonal factor also typically results in net revenue during the fourth quarter of any year being typically higher than the revenue for the first quarter of the subsequent year

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent auditors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is earned and when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the service has been provided and we have no remaining obligations  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
we define these four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists 
we primarily sell our software products via electronic or paper licenses and typically require a purchase order from the distributor  reseller or end user depending on the arrangement who have previously negotiated a master distribution or resale agreement and an executed product license agreement from the end user 
for appliance sales  our customary practice is to require a purchase order from distributors and resellers who have previously negotiated a master packaged product distribution or resale agreement 
we typically recognize revenue upon shipment for our appliance sales 
for technical support  product training and consulting services  we require a purchase order and an executed agreement 
for saas  we generally require the customer or the reseller to electronically accept the terms of an online services agreement or execute a contract 
delivery has occurred and we have no remaining obligations 
we consider delivery of licenses under electronic licensing agreements to have occurred when the related products are shipped and the end user has been electronically provided the software activation keys that allow the end user to take immediate possession of the product 
for hardware appliance sales  our standard delivery method is free on board shipping point 
consequently  we consider delivery of appliances to have occurred when the products are shipped pursuant to an agreement and purchase order 
for saas  delivery occurs upon providing the users with their login id and password 
for product training and consulting services  we fulfill our obligation when the services are performed 
for license updates  technical support and saas  we assume that our obligation is satisfied ratably over the respective terms of the agreements  which are typically to months 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
in the normal course of business  we do not provide customers with the right to a refund of any portion of their license fees or extended payment terms 
the fees are considered fixed and determinable upon establishment of an arrangement that contains the final terms of the sale including description  quantity and price of each product or service purchased 
for saas  the fee is considered fixed or determinable if it is not subject to refund or adjustment 
collectability is probable 
we determine collectability on a customer by customer basis and generally do not require collateral 
we typically sell product licenses and license updates to distributors or resellers for whom there are histories of successful collection 
new customers are typically subject to a credit review process that evaluates their financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
customers are also subject to an ongoing credit review process 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectability is not probable  revenue recognition is deferred until customer payment is received and the other parameters of revenue recognition described above have been achieved 
management s judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on an evaluation of customer specific information  historical experience and economic market conditions 
the majority of our product license revenue consists of revenue from the sale of stand alone software products 
stand alone software sales generally include a perpetual license to our software and are subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in accordance with this guidance  we allocate revenue to license updates related to our stand alone software and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vsoe of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria described above have been met 
the balance of the revenues  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered 
if management cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on vsoe of fair value  revenue recognition is deferred until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we also make certain judgments to record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives  at the time sales are recorded 
our hardware appliances contain software components that are essential to the overall functionality of the products 
for hardware appliance transactions entered into prior to january   revenue for arrangements with multiple elements  such as sales of products that included services  was allocated to each element using the residual method based on the vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered items pursuant to authoritative guidance 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
if vsoe of one or more undelivered items does not exist  revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized at the 
table of contents earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element  in which case  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period 
in october  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in october  the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to provide updated guidance on how the deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices  or esp  of deliverables if a vendor does not have vsoe of selling price or third party evidence of selling price  or tpe  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
effective january   we adopted these standards on a prospective basis for new and materially modified arrangements originating after december  the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations for the year ended december  we do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in the future 
however  we expect that this amended accounting guidance will facilitate our efforts to optimize our offerings due to better alignment between the economics of an arrangement and the accounting  which  may lead us to engage in new go to market practices in the future 
in particular  we expect that the amended accounting standards will enable us to better integrate non software products and services without vsoe into existing offerings and solutions 
as our go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in selling prices  including both vsoe and esp 
for new and materially modified multiple element transactions which contain non software deliverables subsequent to the adoption of the amended revenue recognition standards  the arrangement consideration is allocated to stand alone software deliverables as a group and the non software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of using the selling price hierarchy in the amended revenue recognition guidance 
the selling price hierarchy for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available  tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 
vsoe of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical discounting trends for specific products and services 
tpe of selling price is established by evaluating competitor products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
however  as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and our solutions offer substantially different features and functionality  the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained 
additionally  as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products selling prices are on a stand alone basis  we are not typically able to determine tpe 
the estimate of selling price is established considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels and competitor pricing strategies 
for our non software deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables 
for our hardware appliances we use esp as our selling price 
for our support and services  we generally use vsoe as our selling price 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe for our support and services  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
our saas is purchased by large enterprises  small and medium sized businesses  as well as individuals  and are centrally hosted within our datacenters 
our saas are considered service arrangements per the authoritative guidance  accordingly  fees related to online service agreements are recognized ratably over the contract term 
in addition  saas revenues may also include set up fees  which are recognized ratably over the contract term or the expected customer life  whichever is longer 
generally  our saas is sold separately and not bundled with enterprise division products and services 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the authoritative guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service or performance period  which is the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected term of the award  the risk free interest rate and any expected dividends 

table of contents for purposes of determining the expected volatility factor  we used the implied volatility in two year market traded options on our common stock based on third party volatility quotes in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
the expected term of our options is based on historical employee exercise patterns 
we also analyzed our historical pattern of option exercises based on certain demographic characteristics and we determined that there were no meaningful differences in option exercise activity based on demographic characteristics 
the approximate risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term on our options 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  we used a dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based payment awards that vest based on service  including those with graded vesting schedules  are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we issue non vested stock units with performance goals to certain senior members of management 
the number of non vested stock units underlying each award may be determined based on a range of attainment within defined performance goals 
we are required to estimate the attainment that will be achieved related to the defined performance goals and number of non vested stock units that will ultimately be awarded in order to recognize compensation expense over the vesting period 
if our initial estimates of performance goal attainment change  the related expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on those estimates and if the performance goals are not met  no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to options and non vested stock units 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for further information regarding our adoption of the authoritative guidance for stock based compensation 
valuation and classification of investments the authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price 
our available for sale investments are measured to fair value on a recurring basis and accordingly are carried at fair value 
in addition  we hold investments that are accounted for based on the cost method 
these investments are periodically reviewed for impairment and when indicators of impairment exist  are measured to fair value as appropriate on a non recurring basis 
in determining the fair value of our investments we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques 
the authoritative guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
the authoritative guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level  observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level  inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level  unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which requires us to develop our own assumptions 
observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are based on market data obtained from independent sources  such as market quoted prices 
when level observable inputs for our investments are not available to determine their 
table of contents fair value  we must then use other inputs which may include indicative pricing for securities from the same issuer with similar terms  yield curve information  benchmark data  prepayment speeds and credit quality or unobservable inputs that reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the investments based on the best information available in the circumstances 
when valuation techniques  other than those described as level are utilized  management must make estimations and judgments in determining the fair value for its investments 
the degree to which management s estimation and judgment is required is generally dependent upon the market pricing available for the investments  the availability of observable inputs  the frequency of trading in the investments and the investment s complexity 
if we make different judgments regarding unobservable inputs we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of our investments 
after we have determined the fair value of our investments  for those that are in an unrealized loss position  we must then determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we review our investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment and if different judgments are used the classification of the losses related to our investments could differ 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the carrying value of an available for sale investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than carrying value our intent to retain or sell the investment and whether it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the investment before the recovery of its amortized cost basis  which may not be until maturity 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  rating agency actions and changes in credit default swap levels 
for our cost method investments  our quarterly review of impairment indicators encompasses the analysis of specific criteria of the entity  such as cash position  financing needs  operational performance  management changes  competition and turnaround potential 
if any of the above impairment indicators are present  we further evaluate whether an other than temporary impairment should be recorded 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources for more information on our investments and fair value measurements 
product related technology assets we have acquired product related technology assets from our business combinations and other third party agreements 
in applying purchase accounting  we allocate a portion of purchase price of acquired companies to the product related technology assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
we typically engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of product related technology assets acquired 
such valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in determining the fair value and useful lives of the product related technology assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows earned from the product related technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
we monitor acquired product related technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by reviewing indicators of impairment 
if an indicator exists we compare the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology 
the recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize products utilizing these technologies 
the estimated net realizable value of the purchased technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such technology 
our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our products 
actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from product related technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value 
if these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors  and there is no alternative future use for the technology  we could determine that some or all of their remaining million carrying value is impaired 
in the event of impairment  we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
goodwill at december   we had  million in goodwill related to our acquisitions 
the goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
our revenues are derived from sales of our enterprise division products  which include our desktop solutions  datacenter and cloud solutions and related technical services and from sales of our online services division s web collaboration  remote access and support services 
the enterprise division and the online services division constitute our two reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for additional information regarding our reportable 
table of contents segments 
we evaluate goodwill between these segments  which represent our reporting units 
we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb s authoritative guidance  which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to an annual impairment test 
we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in we early adopted the authoritative guidance  which provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing for goodwill is necessary  which we refer to as the qualitative screen 
in performing the qualitative screen for our goodwill impairment test  we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to the following the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business  industry and market trends  and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate 
if after performing the qualitative screen impairment indicators are present  we would perform a quantitative impairment test to estimate the fair value of goodwill 
in doing so  we would estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the goodwill carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations 
we performed the qualitative screen for our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of as a result of the qualitative screen  no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary in there was no impairment of goodwill as a result of the annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarters of and excluding goodwill  we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in net deferred tax assets 
the authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that a million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses was necessary 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the following discussion relating to the individual financial statement captions  our overall financial performance  operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in overview and part item a entitled risk factors  included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   which could impact our future performance and financial position

product licenses primarily represent fees related to the licensing of the following major products our desktop solutions  comprised primarily of our desktop virtualization product xendesktop and our application virtualization product xenapp  and our datacenter and cloud solutions revenues are primarily comprised of sales of our cloud networking products  which include netscaler  branch repeater and access gateway and our cloud platform products  which include xenserver  cloudstack and cloudportal 
in addition  we offer incentive programs to our vads and vars to stimulate demand for our products 
product license revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our vads and vars 
license updates consist of fees related to our subscription advantage program that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
subscription advantage is an annual renewable program that provides 
table of contents subscribers with automatic delivery of unspecified software upgrades  enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription 
technical services revenues are comprised of fees from technical support  which includes hardware and software maintenance  and are recognized ratably over the contract term  as well as revenues from product training and certification  and consulting services revenue related to the implementation of our products  which are recognized as the services are provided 
saas in our enterprise division includes fees from sales of our sharefile products  which are delivered as a subscription service and are recognized ratably over the contract term 
our online services division s revenues consist of fees related to our saas products from our web collaboration products which primarily include our gotomeeting  gotowebinar  hi def audio  and gototraining services  our connectivity product  gotomypc  and our remote it support which primarily include gotoassist and gotomanage 
our online services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term 
during the first quarter of  we performed a review of the historical presentation of the revenue categories presented in our consolidated statements of income 
as a result  we will adopt a revised presentation  which we believe is more comparable to those presented by other companies in our industry and better reflects our evolving product offerings  for example  our new software maintenance products 
beginning in the first quarter of technical support and hardware and software maintenance revenues  which are currently presented in technical services  and license updates will be classified together as license updates and maintenance 
product training and certification and consulting services  which are currently presented in technical services  will be classified together as professional services 
the classification of product licenses and software as a service will remain unchanged 
this change in our presentation will not affect our total net revenues  total cost of net revenues or gross margin 
year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands revenues product licenses license updates software as a service technical services total net revenues product licenses product license revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to increased sales of our desktop solutions  led by xendesktop of million and increased sales of our datacenter and cloud solutions  led by netscaler  of million 
product license revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to increased sales of our datacenter and cloud solutions  led by netscaler  of million and increased sales of our desktop solutions  led by xendesktop and related programs of million 
we currently target product license sales to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of license updates license updates revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to an increase in subscription advantage renewal sales over a larger base of subscribers 
license updates revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to an increase in new subscription advantage sales  led by increased xendesktop product sales 
we currently are targeting that license updates revenue will increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of and when comparing the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of as described above  in the first quarter of license updates revenue will be classified in maintenance revenues 
software as a service software as a service revenues increased during when compared to and during compared to primarily due to increased sales of our online services division s web collaboration products 
we currently target our software as a service revenues to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of and when comparing the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of due primarily to increased sales of our web collaboration products 

table of contents technical services technical services revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to increases in technical support revenues of million driven by increased sales of our datacenter and cloud solutions and an increase in consulting revenues of million related to increased sales of our enterprise division s products 
technical services revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to increases in support revenues of million driven by increased sales of our datacenter and cloud solutions and an increase in consulting revenues of million related to increased sales of our enterprise division s products 
we currently target technical support and consulting revenues to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of consistent with the increase in product license revenue described above 
as described above  in the first quarter of product training and certification and consulting services will be classified as professional services revenues  and hardware and software maintenance and technical support will be classified as maintenance revenues 
deferred revenue deferred revenues are primarily comprised of license updates revenue from subscription advantage  technical services revenues related to our support services and consulting contracts and software as a service revenues from annual service agreements 
deferred revenues primarily increased approximately million as of december  compared to december  primarily due to increased sales and renewals of our subscription advantage product of million and increased sales of our support services of million 
we currently target deferred revenue to continue to increase in while it is generally our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders  we sometimes have product license orders that have not shipped 
although the amount of such product license orders may vary  the amount  if any  of such product license orders at the end of a particular period has not been material to total revenue at the end of any reporting period 
we do not believe that backlog  as of any particular date  is a reliable indicator of future performance 
international revenues international revenues sales outside the united states accounted for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december   of our net revenues for the year ended december  and of our net revenues for the year ended december  for detailed information on international revenues  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  segment revenues our revenues are derived from sales of enterprise division products which primarily include our desktop solutions  datacenter and cloud solutions products and related technical services and from our online services division s web collaboration  connectivity and remote support services 
the enterprise division and the online services division constitute our two reportable segments 
an analysis of our reportable segment net revenue is presented below in thousands year ended december  revenue growth revenue growth to to in thousands enterprise division online services division consolidated net revenues with respect to our segment revenues  the increase in net revenues for the comparative periods presented was due primarily to the factors previously discussed above 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for additional information on our segment revenues 

table of contents cost of net revenues year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands cost of product license revenues cost of services revenues amortization of product related intangible assets total cost of net revenues cost of product license revenues consists primarily of hardware  product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials  shipping expense and royalties 
cost of services revenue consists primarily of compensation and other personnel related costs of providing technical support and consulting  as well as the costs related to providing our saas 
also included in cost of net revenues is amortization of product related intangible assets 
cost of product license revenues increased during when compared to and during when compared to primarily due to increased sales of our datacenter and cloud solutions  as described above  many of which contain hardware components that have a higher cost than our other software products 
we currently are targeting cost of product license revenues will increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of consistent with increases in our product license revenues 
cost of services revenues increased during compared to consistent with the increase in sales of our web collaboration products  and related investments in platforms and server capacity of million 
also contributing to the increase in cost of services revenues is an increase in consulting and support costs of million related to increased sales of our enterprise division s technical services as described above 
cost of services revenues increased during compared to consistent with the increase in revenue of technical services related to our enterprise division s products as described above 
we currently are targeting cost of services revenues will increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of consistent with the increase in software as a service and technical services revenues as discussed above 
gross margin gross margin as a percent of revenue was for  for and for the slight decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue for all periods presented was primarily due to the increase in sales of products with a hardware component and increased sales of our services both of which have a higher cost than our software products 
operating expenses foreign currency impact on operating expenses a substantial majority of our overseas operating expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the impact on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks up to months in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
when the dollar is weak  the resulting increase to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the gain in our hedging contracts 
when the dollar is strong  the resulting decrease to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the loss in our hedging contracts 
there is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the timeframe for which we hedge our risk 
research and development expenses year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands research and development research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs and facility and equipment costs directly related to our research and development activities 
we expensed substantially all development costs included in the research and development of our products 

table of contents research and development expenses increased during as compared to due to a million increase in compensation and other employee related costs primarily related to increased headcount due to strategic hiring and acquisitions 
partially offsetting the increases in research and development costs when comparing to is a million decrease in stock based compensation expense due to stock based awards related to certain acquisitions that fully vested 
research and development expenses increased during as compared to primarily due to a million increase in compensation and other employee related costs 
also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses was a million increase in facilities and related depreciation 
these increases primarily relate to the strategic hiring of employees in research and development as discussed above in our executive summary 
sales  marketing and services expenses year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands sales  marketing and services sales  marketing and services expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs  including sales commissions  pre sales support  the costs of marketing programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as brand development  advertising  trade shows  public relations and other market development programs and costs related to our facilities  equipment and information systems that are directly related to our sales  marketing and services activities 
sales  marketing and services expenses increased during compared to primarily due to an million increase in compensation  including variable compensation and employee related costs due to additional headcount in our sales force and technical services group  as well as from our acquisitions 
also contributing to the increase in sales  marketing and services expense was a million increase in facilities costs and related depreciation consistent with the increase in headcount and a million increase in marketing program costs related to various marketing campaigns and events 
sales  marketing and services expenses increased during compared to primarily due to a million increase in compensation including variable compensation and employee related costs due to additional headcount in our sales force and technical services group 
also contributing to the increase in sales  marketing and services expense was a million increase in marketing program costs related to our brand awareness campaigns 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs and expenses related to outside consultants assisting with information systems  as well as accounting and legal fees 
general and administrative expenses increased during compared to primarily due to an increase in compensation and employee related costs of million due to additional headcount  primarily in it  facilities and operations  to support our growth and a related increase in stock based compensation of million 
also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expense is a million increase in professional fees primarily related to acquisitions and strategic investment activity 
general and administrative expenses increased during compared to primarily due to an increase in compensation and employee related costs due to additional headcount  primarily in it 
operating expense outlook during the first quarter of  we revised our methodology for allocating certain it support costs to more closely align these costs with the employees directly utilizing the related assets and services 
as a result  certain it support costs will be reclassified from general and administrative expenses to research and development expenses and sales  marketing and services expenses based on the headcount in each of these functional areas 

table of contents when comparing the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of  we are targeting operating expenses to increase in research and development and sales  marketing and services due to the full quarter impact of the acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of  investments that we have made in headcount and related expenses as well as the re allocation of certain it support costs as discussed above 
conversely  we are targeting general and administrative expenses to decrease by the amount of it support costs allocated to research and development and sales  marketing and services  as described above 
this decrease will be partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses due to the full quarter impact of the acquisitions completed in fourth quarter of and investments in headcount and related costs that we have made to support our growth 
amortization of other intangible assets year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of amortization of customer relationships  trade names and covenants not to compete primarily related to our acquisitions 
the increase in amortization of other intangible assets during as compared to was primarily due to acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions of million offset by other acquired customer related intangible assets becoming fully amortized during of million 
the decrease in amortization of other intangible assets during as compared to was primarily due to acquired customer related intangible assets becoming fully amortized during as of december   we had unamortized other identified intangible assets with estimable useful lives in the net amount of million 
for more information regarding our acquisitions see  overview and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  other expense income  net year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands other expense income  net other expense income  net is primarily comprised of remeasurement of foreign currency transaction gains losses  realized gains losses related to changes in the fair value of our investments that have a decline in fair value that is considered other than temporary  recognized gains losses related to investments and interest expense which was not material for all periods presented 
the increase in other expense income  net when comparing to primarily due to a gain on remeasurement of our foreign currency transactions of million and a decrease in losses recognized on prepayments at par of securities purchased at a premium within our available for sale investment portfolio of million partially offset by an impairment recognized on a cost method investment of million 
other expense income  net increased when comparing to primarily due to losses recognized on prepayments at par of securities purchased at a premium within our available for sale investment portfolio 
for more information see liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  income taxes we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to us federal income taxes  as well as income taxes of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local  or non us  income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain and judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the 
table of contents large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in june  we reached a settlement in principle with the irs regarding certain previously disclosed income tax deficiencies asserted in a revenue agent s report  or rar 
under the terms of the settlement in principle  we would agree to an assessment of income tax deficiencies in full settlement of all open claims under the rar and would resolve with finality for future years all of the transfer pricing issues raised in the rar 
based on this  we incurred a charge of million in in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
among other things  the authoritative guidance requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and non recognition of tax positions 
it further requires that a change in management judgment related to prior years tax positions be recognized in the quarter of such change 
the final settlement requires the finalization of tax deficiency calculations with the irs and a written agreement signed by the irs 
it is uncertain how long it will take to reach a final settlement with the irs 
there can be no assurances that a final written agreement will be obtained or that this matter will otherwise be resolved in our favor 
an adverse outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in net deferred tax assets 
the authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits was necessary 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
we maintain certain strategic management and operational activities in overseas subsidiaries and our foreign earnings are taxed at rates that are generally lower than in the united states 
we do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
our effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate when comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  was not significant 
our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of due primarily to lower tax rates on earnings generated by our foreign operations that are taxed primarily in switzerland 
we have not provided for us taxes for those earnings because we plan to reinvest all of those earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
our effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the mix of earnings from our us and foreign jurisdictions 
accordingly  earnings from the production and distribution of our products and services through our foreign headquarters in switzerland are currently taxed at lower income tax rates than earnings from our us operations 
liquidity and capital resources during we generated operating cash flows of million 
these operating cash flows related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for  among other things  non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization expenses of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
also contributing to these cash inflows was an aggregate increase in operating assets and liabilities of million  net of effects of acquisitions 
our investing activities used million of cash consisting primarily of cash paid for acquisitions of million  the purchase of property and equipment of million and million in cash paid for licensing agreements and other assets 
these investing cash outflows were partially offset by net sales of investments of million 
our financing activities used cash of million primarily due to stock repurchases of million 
this financing cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based compensation plans of million 
during we generated operating cash flows of million 
these cash flows related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for  among other things  non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation expense of million and the tax effect of stock based compensation of million 
also contributing to these cash inflows is an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of million  net of the effects of acquisitions 
these operating cash inflows are partially offset by the excess benefit from the exercise of stock options of million and million related to a deferred income tax benefit 
our investing activities used million of cash consisting primarily of cash paid for net purchases of investments of million 
also 
table of contents contributing to these cash outflows is the purchase of property and equipment of million  million in cash paid for licensing agreements and other assets and million in cash paid for acquisitions 
our financing activities used cash of million  primarily from expenditures on our stock repurchase program of million partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based compensation plans of million and the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of million 
historically  significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations 
we currently expect this trend to continue throughout we believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives 
we could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions 
cash  cash equivalents and investments december  compared to in thousands cash  cash equivalents and investments the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  as compared to december   is primarily due to cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  of million  expenditures made on stock repurchases of million  purchases of property and equipment of million and purchases of cost method investments and product related intangible assets of million partially offset by cash provided by our operating activities of million and cash received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based compensation plans of million 
as of december   million of the  million of cash  cash equivalents and investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds are needed for our operations in the united states  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
our current plans are not expected to require repatriation of cash and investments to fund our us operations and  as a result  we intend to permanently reinvest our foreign earnings 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs 
our short term and long term investments primarily consist of interest bearing securities 
fair value measurements the authoritative guidance defines fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  the guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
available for sale securities included in level are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service  or the service  which uses quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments rather than direct observations of quoted prices in active markets 
the service gathers observable inputs for all of our fixed income securities from a variety of industry data providers including  for example  large custodial institutions and other third party sources 
once the observable inputs are gathered by the service  all data points are considered and an average price is determined 
the service s providers utilize a variety of inputs to determine their quoted prices 
these inputs may include interest rates  known historical trades  yield curve information  benchmark data  prepayment speeds  credit quality and broker dealer quotes 
substantially all of our available for sale investments are valued utilizing inputs obtained from the service and accordingly are categorized as level in the table below 
we periodically independently assess the pricing obtained from the service and historically have not adjusted the service s pricing as a result of this assessment 
available for sale securities are included in level when relevant observable inputs for a security are not available 

table of contents our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy 
in certain instances  the inputs used to measure fair value may meet the definition of more than one level of the fair value hierarchy 
the input with the lowest level priority is used to determine the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis our fixed income available for sale security portfolio generally consists of high quality  investment grade securities from diverse issuers with a minimum credit rating of a a and a weighted average credit rating of aa aa we previously classified these investments as level because we did not make adjustments to the prices obtained from the service 
however  as we value these securities based on pricing from the service  whose sources may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level inputs or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly level inputs in determining fair value  we began classifying all of our fixed income available for sale securities as level during see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for more information regarding our available for sale investments 
we measure our cash flow hedges  which are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities  at fair value based on indicative prices in active markets level inputs 
we have invested in convertible debt securities of certain early stage entities that are classified as available for sale investments 
as quoted prices in active markets or other observable inputs were not available for these investments  in order to measure them at fair value  we utilized a discounted cash flow model using a discount rate reflecting the market risk inherent in holding securities of an early stage enterprise  adjusted by the probability weighted exit possibilities associated with the convertible debt securities 
this methodology required us to make assumptions that were not directly or indirectly observable regarding the fair value of the convertible debt securities  accordingly it is a level valuation and is included in the purchases of level securities line in the table below 
assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level long term investments in thousands balance at december  purchases of level securities proceeds received on level securities decrease in previously recognized unrealized losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income balance at december  in september  our investment in aig matched funding corporation matured and proceeds of million were received 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for more information 
assets measured at fair value on a non recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level during the third quarter of  one of our cost method investments with a carrying value of million was determined to be impaired and has been written down to its fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million  which is included in other expense income in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the fair value of the cost method investment represents a level valuation as the assumptions used in valuing this investment were not directly or indirectly observable

effective september   we entered into an amendment and restatement of our credit facility  or the amendment 
the amendment decreased the overall range of interest rates we paid on amounts outstanding on the credit facility and lowered the facility fee 
in addition  the amendment extended the term of the credit facility until september  the credit facility  as amended  provided for a revolving line of credit in the aggregate amount of million  subject to continued covenant compliance 
the credit facility  as amended  bore interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus and adjusted in the range of to above libor based on the level of our total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined in the agreement 
in addition  we were required to pay a quarterly facility fee ranging from to based on the aggregate amount available under the credit facility  as amended  and the level of our total debt and its adjusted ebitda 
we did not renew the credit facility and it expired on september  upon expiration  there was no indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility 
stock repurchase program our board of directors authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of billion 
we may use the approved dollar authority to repurchase stock at any time until the approved amounts are exhausted 
the objective of our stock repurchase program is to improve stockholders returns 
at december   approximately million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
all shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  a portion of the funds used to repurchase stock over the course of the program was provided by proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit 
we are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds 
additionally  from time to time  we may enter into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares 
these programs include terms that require us to make up front payments to the counterparty financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during or at the end of the agreement or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreement  depending on market conditions

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangement contractual obligations we have certain contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements

total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellations without payment provisions exist and excludes million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions recorded in accordance with authoritative guidance  because we could not make reasonably reliable estimates of the period or amount of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities

table of contents office leases we have operating lease obligations through related to two properties that are not utilized 
at december   the total remaining obligation on these leases was approximately million  of which million was accrued as of december   and is reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  in calculating this accrual  we made estimates  based on market information  including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates related to these vacant facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
the counterparties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results could differ materially 
discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  including euros  british pounds sterling  japanese yen  australian dollars  swiss francs  indian rupees  hong kong dollars  canadian dollars  singapore dollars and chinese renminbi 
to reduce our exposure to a reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
our hedging program significantly reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
at december  and  we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair liability value of million and at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of million 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates  the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by million  resulting in a net asset position 
in these hypothetical movements  foreign operating costs would move in the opposite direction 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as the prices of our competitors products become more or less attractive 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these foreign exchange forward contracts 
exposure to interest rates we have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale investments 
we maintain available for sale investments in debt securities and we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income 
if market 
table of contents interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
if market interest rates were to decrease by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our available for sale and trading investment portfolios 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
