these segments also have complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications which provide us a net competitive advantage 
our segments also benefit from our global footprint and our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively 
the reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than well respected brand names such as worthington  idp  valtek  limitorque and durametallic  which we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry 
our products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than  companies  including some of the world s leading engineering  procurement and construction firms  original equipment manufacturers  distributors and end users 
we continue to build on our geographic breadth through our qrc network with the goal to be positioned as near to our customers as possible for service and support throughout the product life cycle in order to capture this important aftermarket business 
along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell  install and service our equipment in remote regions  it is equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations 
we continue to expand our global supply chain capability to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products 
we continue to devote resources to improving the supply chain processes across our divisions to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands 
we continue to focus on improving on time delivery and quality  while managing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations  through the assistance of a focused continuous improvement process cip initiative 
the goal of the cip initiative  which includes lean manufacturing  six sigma business management strategy and value engineering  is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on time delivery  reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity 
we experienced improved demand for original equipment in as compared with as the effects from the global recession began to diminish  several demand forecasts improved  which promoted increased capital investment spending and planning 
the oil and gas industry saw improved conditions as the developing regions economic growth plans rekindled projections of demand growth for oil and natural gas 
pipeline and refining investments were driven by infrastructure expansion plans in these growing regions 
the developing regions also experienced improved conditions in the investment in chemical processing and general industries 
in the mature regions  all three of these industries experienced a moderate increase in levels of investment  although overcapacity in oil refining affected capital investments 
in the area of power generation  uncertainty over environmental 
table of contents regulations challenged spending levels  while the water management industry displayed weakness in its spending levels  as planned desalination projects continue to be delayed as governments evaluated fiscal priorities 
a critical component of our growth strategy remains our investment in expanding our aftermarket capabilities to provide local support to maximize our customers investment in our offerings  as well as to provide stability for our business during various economic periods 
in  we experienced improved demand in our global aftermarket business as compared with this was driven by our customers need to maintain continuing operations and the expansion of our aftermarket capabilities provided through our new integrated solutions offerings 
customers desire to gain operational efficiencies and increase throughput from existing facilities provided opportunities to leverage our engineering knowledge and technological capabilities to design solutions that produce the desired business result 
in  we continued to execute on our strategy to increase our presence in all regions of our global market to capture aftermarket opportunities 
we believe that with our customer relationships  our global presence and our highly regarded technical capabilities  we will continue to have opportunities in our core industries  however  we face challenges affecting many companies in our industry with a significant multi national presence  such as economic  political  currency and other risks 
our markets the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the outlook for section included in this md a 
our products and services are used in several distinct industries oil and gas  chemical  power generation  water management  and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as general industries 
demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers 
the level of new capital investment depends  in turn  on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas  power generation and water management  as well as general economic conditions 
these drivers are generally related to the phase of the business cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior 
the levels of maintenance expenditures are additionally driven by the reliability of equipment  planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process 
our customers include engineering  procurement and construction firms  original equipment manufacturers  end users and distributors 
sales to engineering  procurement and construction firms and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications  as are certain sales to distributors 
project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects 
the quick turnaround business  which we also refer to as book and ship  is defined as orders that are received from the customer booked and shipped within three months of receipt 
these orders are typically for more standardized  general purpose products  parts or services 
each of our three business segments generates certain levels of this type of business 
in the sale of aftermarket products and services  we benefit from a large installed base of our original equipment  which requires maintenance  repair and replacement parts 
we use our manufacturing platform and global network of qrcs to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services  such as installation  advanced diagnostics  repair and retrofitting 
in geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response  we believe customers have traditionally relied on us  rather than our competitors  for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products 
however  the aftermarket for standard products is competitive  as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products 
as proximity of service centers  timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for all aftermarket products and services  we continue to expand our global qrc network to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business 
oil and gas the oil and gas industry  which represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively  experienced a stable level of capital spending in compared to the previous year due to the need to continue building infrastructure in order to bring future capacity on line to meet future demand expectations 
the majority of investment by the major oil companies continued to focus on upstream production activities  however  there were improved levels of spending in both mid stream pipeline and downstream refining operations  particularly in the developing markets 
refining overcapacity remained a concern throughout the year in the mature regions  as overall demand for oil remained volatile throughout the year 
aftermarket opportunities in this industry improved throughout the year  with our integrated solutions offering helping to offset a reduction in service related business  as many refineries performed this work with their own personnel 
the outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies 
we believe oil and gas companies will continue with upstream and downstream investment plans that are in line with projections of future demand growth and the production declines of existing operations 
a projected decline in demand could cause oil and gas companies to reduce their overall level of spending  which could decrease demand for our products and services 

table of contents however  we believe the long term fundamentals for this industry remain solid based on current supply  projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long term demand growth 
with our long standing reputation in providing successful solutions for upstream  mid stream and downstream applications  along with the advancements in our portfolio of offerings  we believe that we continue to be well positioned to pursue the opportunities in this industry around the globe 
chemical the chemical industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
capital spending in the chemical industry rebounded in with the expansion of existing facilities and the approval of new projects around the world 
the middle east and asia have seen significant growth in chemical projects as countries in those regions try to access the higher margins available downstream in the petrochemical markets 
additionally  north america has seen a revival in the chemical industry  where shale gas has changed the economics of production allowing for a lower cost abundant feedstock to drive high value chemical projects 
the aftermarket opportunities improved for the majority of the year with indications that the improvements will continue into despite a strong year  the outlook for the chemical industry remains heavily dependent on global economic conditions 
as global economies stabilize and unemployment conditions improve  a rise in consumer spending should follow 
an increase in spending would drive greater demand for chemical based products supporting improved levels of capital investment 
we believe the chemical industry in the near term will continue to invest in maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that developing regions will continue investing in capital infrastructure to meet current and future indigenous demand 
we believe our global presence and our localized aftermarket capabilities are well positioned to serve the potential growth opportunities in this industry 
power generation the power generation industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
in  the power generation industry continued to experience some softness in capital spending in the mature regions driven by the uncertainty related to environmental regulations  as well as potential regulatory impacts to the overall civilian nuclear market 
in the developing regions  capital investment remained in place driven by increased demand forecasts for electricity in countries such as china and india 
global concerns about the environment continue to support an increase in desired future capacity from renewable energy sources 
the majority of the active and planned construction throughout continued to utilize designs based on fossil fuels 
natural gas increased its percentage of utilization driven by market prices for gas remaining low and relatively stable 
with the potential of unconventional sources of gas  such as shale gas  the power generation industry is forecasting an increased use of this form of fuel for power generation plants 
we believe the outlook for the power generation industry remains favorable 
current legislative efforts to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide may have an adverse effect on investment plans depending on the potential requirements imposed and the timing of compliance by country 
however  we believe that proposed methods of limiting carbon dioxide emissions offer business opportunities for our products and services 
we believe the long term fundamentals for the power generation industry remain solid based on projected increases in demand for electricity driven by global population growth  advancements of industrialization and growth of urbanization in developing markets 
we also believe that our long standing reputation in the power generation industry  our portfolio of offerings for the various generating methods  our advancements in serving the renewable energy market and carbon capture methodologies  as well as our global service and support structure  position us well for the future opportunities in this important industry 
water management the water management industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
although the water management industry displayed weakness in spending levels in as desalination projects continued to be delayed  worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems  many of which require products that we offer  particularly pumps 
we believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continuing investments 
the water management industry is facing a future supply demand challenge relative to forecasted global population growth coupled with the advancement of industrialization and urbanization 
due to the limitations of usable fresh water around the globe  there continues to be an increased investment in desalination 
this investment is forecasted to significantly increase over the next several decades 
we believe we are a global leader in the desalination market  which is already an important source of fresh water in the mediterranean region and the middle east 
we expect that this trend in desalination will expand from these traditional areas to other coastal areas around the globe  which we believe presents a significant market opportunity for pumps  valves  actuation products and energy recovery devices 

table of contents general industries general industries comprises a variety of different businesses  including mining and ore processing  pharmaceuticals  pulp and paper  food and beverage and other smaller applications  none of which individually represented more than of total bookings in and general industries also includes sales to distributors  whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve 
general industries represented  in the aggregate  approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
in  we saw improving conditions in the majority of these businesses 
pulp and paper  mining and ore processing and food and beverage all saw improved conditions in compared with this was generally supported by the improving economic conditions in several parts of the world 
we also experienced increased business levels through our distribution network  as business conditions improved and inventory levels required replenishment 
the outlook for this group of industries is heavily dependent upon the condition of global economies and consumer confidence levels 
the long term fundamentals of many of these industries remain sound as many of the products produced by these industries are common staples of industrialized and urbanized economies 
we believe that our specialty product offerings designed for these industries and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide future business opportunities 
our results of operations throughout this discussion of our results of operations  we discuss the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have calculated currency effects by translating current year results on a monthly basis at prior year exchange rates for the same periods 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data item of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  annual report  ongoing political and economic conditions in north africa have caused us to experience shipment delays to this region 
we estimate that the shipments to this region that have been delayed resulted in lost or delayed opportunities for operating income of million million for epd and million for ipd for the preponderance of our physical assets in the region are located in the kingdom of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates and have  to date  not been significantly affected by the unrest elsewhere in the region 
we continue to assess the conditions and potential adverse impacts of the earthquake and tsunami in japan in early  in particular as they relate to our customers and suppliers in the impacted regions  as well as announced and potential regulatory impacts to the global nuclear power market 
during  we did not experience any significant adverse impacts due to shipment delays  collection issues or supply chain disruptions related to these events 
we are also closely monitoring the effects of the japan crisis on the global nuclear power industry 
while it is difficult to estimate the long term effect of the fukushima plant shutdown on the global nuclear power market  we have continued to ship nuclear orders in our backlog without significant disruption 
we believe that there has been a related reduction in nuclear orders that could continue in the near term  though other parts of our overall power generation business could benefit as nuclear power priorities are reevaluated 
other than broad  macro level economic impacts  we did not experience any direct or measurable disruptions in due to the european sovereign debt crisis 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of any future developments in the region on our current business  our customers and suppliers and the state of the global economy 
additional adverse developments could potentially impact our customers exposures to sovereign and non sovereign european debt and could soften the level of capital investment and demand for our products and services 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report  effective october   we acquired for inclusion in epd  lawrence pumps  inc lpi  a privately owned  united states us based company specializing in the design  development and manufacture of engineered centrifugal slurry pumps for critical services within the petroleum refining  petrochemical  pulp and paper and energy markets 
lpi was acquired in a cash transaction valued at million  subject to final adjustments

no pro forma information has been provided for these acquisitions due to immateriality 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report  beginning in  we initiated realignment programs to reduce and optimize certain non strategic manufacturing facilities and our overall cost structure by improving our operating efficiency  reducing redundancies  maximizing global consistency and driving improved financial performance  as well as expanding our efforts to optimize assets  respond to reduced orders and drive an enhanced customer facing organization realignment programs 
these programs are substantially complete 
we currently expect total realignment program charges will be approximately million for approved plans  of which million has been incurred through december  
table of contents charges  net of adjustments  related to our realignment programs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
ipd incurred million  million and million of realignment charges  net of adjustments  for the years ended december   and respectively 
fcd incurred million  million and million of realignment charges  net of adjustments  for the years ended december   and respectively 
epd incurred million  million and million of realignment charges  net of adjustments  for the years ended december   and respectively 
eliminations and all other incurred a million adjustment due to changes in estimates for the year ended december   and million and million of realignment charges  net of adjustments  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
based on actions under our realignment programs  for the year ended december  we realized approximately million of additional savings compared to the year ended december   and we expect to realize annual run rate savings in and beyond of approximately million 
approximately two thirds of savings from the realignment programs were and will be realized in cost of sales cos and the remainder in selling  general and administrative expense sg a 
actual savings realized could vary from expected savings  which represent management s best estimate to date 
in addition  in connection with our previously announced ipd recovery plan  in the second quarter of we initiated new activities to optimize structural parts of ipd s business 
we expect charges related to this program to be non restructuring in nature and will approximate million  of which million was incurred in with the substantial majority recorded in cos

liquidity and capital resources cash flow analysis amounts in millions net cash flows provided by operating activities net cash flows used by investing activities net cash flows used by financing activities existing cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our existing revolving line of credit are our primary sources of short term liquidity 
our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital  particularly accounts receivable and inventories 
our total cash balance at december  was million  compared with million at december  and million at december  our lower cash provided by operating activities reflected additional cash used to support short term working capital needs and the impact of a trend towards contractually longer payment terms in as compared with working capital increased in due primarily to higher accounts receivable of million and higher inventory of million

for reference purposes based on sales  a dso improvement of one day could provide approximately million in cash 
we have not experienced a significant increase in customer payment defaults 
an increase in inventory used million of cash flow for compared with million in and providing cash of million in the increase was primarily due to shipment delays and growth of short cycle orders during  requiring higher raw material and work in process inventory to support end of period backlog 
inventory turns were times at december   compared with times at december  and times at december  our calculation of inventory turns does not reflect the impact of advanced cash received from our customers 
for reference purposes based on data  an improvement of one tenth of a turn could yield approximately million in cash

our cash needs for the next months are expected to be consistent with  resulting from the impact of anticipated share repurchases  an expected improvement in working capital utilization and a small decrease in incentive compensation payments  offset by anticipated increases in pension contributions  capital expenditures and cash dividends 
we believe cash flows from operating activities  combined with availability under our revolving line of credit and our existing cash balances  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next months

because a booking represents a contract that can be  in certain circumstances  modified or canceled  and can include varying lengths between the time of booking and the time of revenue recognition  there is no guarantee that the increase in bookings will result in a comparable increase in revenues or otherwise be indicative of future results 
we expect a continued competitive economic environment in  however  we anticipate benefits from planned increases in shipments from existing backlog  the continuation of our end user strategy  the strength of our high margin aftermarket business  continued disciplined cost management and our diverse customer base  broad product portfolio and unified operating platform

as of december   the gross liability for uncertain tax positions was million 
we do not expect a material payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months 
we are unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the uncertain tax positions

pension and postretirement benefits obligations our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by accounting standards codification asc  compensation retirement benefits 
in accounting for retirement plans  management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  salary growth  long term rates of return on plan assets  retirement rates  turnover  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding 
plan descriptions we and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full time and part time employees 
approximately of total defined benefit pension plan assets and approximately of defined benefit pension obligations are related to the us qualified plan as of december  the assets for the us qualified plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation 
unless specified otherwise  the references in this section are to all of our us and us plans 
none of our common stock is directly held by these plans 
our us defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of us equity and fixed income securities 
our us defined benefit plan assets include a significant concentration of united kingdom uk equity and fixed income securities 
in addition  certain of our defined benefit plans hold investments in european equity and fixed income securities as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we monitor investment allocations and manage plan assets to maintain acceptable levels of risk 
benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on participants compensation and years of credited service 
assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities

the estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in is million 
the estimated actuarial net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in is million 
we amortize estimated prior service benefits and estimated net losses over the remaining expected service period or over the remaining expected lifetime for plans with only inactive participants 
we sponsor defined benefit postretirement medical plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the us these plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies 
we fund the plans as benefits are paid  such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented 
accordingly  we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets 
the benefits under the plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees 
the benefit obligation for our defined benefit postretirement medical plans was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in is less than million 
the estimated actuarial net gain for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in is million 
we amortize estimated prior service benefits and estimated net gain over the remaining expected service period of approximately three years 
accrual accounting and significant assumptions we account for pension benefits using the accrual method  recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees 
the accrual method of accounting for pension benefits requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we  in consultation with our actuaries  evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension and postretirement benefits  such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  mortality rates  retirement rates and assumed rate of compensation increases  and determine such assumptions as of december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year 
depending on the assumptions used  the pension and postretirement expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding 
actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors 
see discussion of our assumptions related to pension and postretirement benefits in the our critical accounting estimates section of this md a

at december   as compared to december   we decreased our discount rate for the us plan from to based on an analysis of publicly traded investment grade us corporate bonds  which had a lower yield due to current market conditions 
we decreased our average discount rate for non us plans from to based primarily on lower applicable corporate aa graded bond yields for the uk  partially offset by higher corporate aa graded bond yields for the euro zone 
the average assumed rate of compensation remained constant at for the us plan and increased from to for our non us plans 
to determine the pension expense  we decreased the expected rate of return on us plan assets from 
table of contents to and we decreased our average rate of return on non us plan assets from to  primarily as a result of the decrease in the uk rate of return on assets 
as the expected rate of return on plan assets is long term in nature  short term market changes do not significantly impact the rates 
we expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be approximately million higher in than the million in  reflecting  among other things  the increased amortization of the actuarial net loss 
we expect the net pension benefit for the postretirement medical plans to be million lower than the million in  primarily reflecting decreased amortization of the unrecognized prior service benefit 
we have used discount rates of  and at december   in calculating our estimated net pension expense for us pension plans  non us pension plans and other postretirement plans  respectively 
the assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in health care costs were for  for and for  with a gradual decrease to for and future years 
if actual costs are higher than those assumed  this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care 
plan funding our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs 
we contributed million  million and million to our defined benefit plans in  and  respectively 
after consideration of our intent to remain fully funded based on standards set by law  we currently anticipate that our contribution to our us pension plan in will be between million and million  excluding direct benefits paid 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our non us pension plans in for further discussions on pension and postretirement benefits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
our critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions  including our historical experience  where relevant 
the most significant estimates made by management include timing and amount of revenue recognition  deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves  reserves for contingent losses  retirement and postretirement benefits  and valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
the significant estimates are reviewed quarterly by management  and management presents its views to the audit committee of our board of directors 
because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements  actual results may differ from the estimates  and the difference may be material 
our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers  which is typically based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions 
in addition  our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement  a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectability 
we defer the recognition of revenue when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and or services have been performed 
freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
our contracts typically include cancellation provisions that require customers to reimburse us for costs incurred up to the date of cancellation  as well as any contractual cancellation penalties 
we enter into certain contracts with multiple deliverables that may include any combination of designing  developing  manufacturing  modifying  installing and commissioning of flow management equipment and providing services related to the performance of such products 
delivery of these products and services typically occurs within a one to two year period  although many arrangements  such as book and ship type orders  have a shorter timeframe for delivery 
we aggregate or separate deliverables into units of accounting based on whether the deliverable s have standalone value to the customer and when no 
table of contents general right of return exists 
contract value is allocated ratably to the units of accounting in the arrangement based on their relative selling prices determined as if the deliverables were sold separately 
revenues for long term contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost to cost basis 
percentage of completion revenue represents less than of our consolidated sales for each year presented 
revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 
revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract 
these contracts can range in duration  but generally extend for up to five years 
fixed fee service contracts represent aproximately of consolidated sales for each year presented 
in certain instances  we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts 
failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non recoverable costs 
in instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable  we perform a project profitability analysis  accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues  which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project 
in such instances  we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined 
in circumstances where the total projected revenues still exceed total projected costs  the incurrence of unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition 
our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies 
deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves we recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for non us subsidiaries  and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances  if necessary 
we assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could  if successful  result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate 
tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from uncertain tax positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
while we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
to the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
reserves for contingent loss liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable 
assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in house experts  including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations 
the recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter  changes in political environments  legal venue and other factors 
recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties  technological innovation and regulatory environment changes 
estimates of liabilities for unsettled asbestos related claims are based on known claims and on our experience during the preceding two years for claims filed  settled and dismissed  with adjustments for events deemed unusual and unlikely to recur  and are included in retirement obligations and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
a substantial majority of our asbestos related claims are covered by insurance or indemnities 
estimated indemnities and receivables from insurance carriers for unsettled claims and receivables for settlements and legal fees paid by us for asbestos related claims are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries  which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers 
estimated receivables are included in other assets  net in our consolidated balance 
table of contents sheets 
in one asbestos insurance related matter  we have a claim in litigation against relevant insurers substantially in excess of the recorded receivable 
if our claim is resolved more favorably than reflected in this receivable  we would benefit from a one time gain in the amount of such excess 
we are currently unable to estimate the impact  if any  of unasserted asbestos related claims  although future claims would also be subject to existing indemnities and insurance coverage 
changes in claims filed  settled and dismissed and differences between actual and estimated settlement costs and insurance or indemnity recoveries could impact future expense 
pension and postretirement benefits we provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain of our employees  including former employees  and their beneficiaries 
the assets  liabilities and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts 
the assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  expected rates of return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates  rates of compensation increases and other factors 
the assumptions utilized to compute expense and benefit obligations are shown in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
these assumptions are assessed annually in consultation with independent actuaries and investment advisors as of december and adjustments are made as needed 
we evaluate prevailing market conditions and local laws and requirements in countries where plans are maintained  including appropriate rates of return  interest rates and medical inflation rates 
we also compare our significant assumptions with our peers 
the methodology to set our assumptions includes discount rates are estimated using high quality debt securities based on corporate or government bond yields with a duration matching the expected benefit payments 
for the us the discount rate is obtained from an analysis of publicly traded investment grade corporate bonds to establish a weighted average discount rate 
for plans in the united kingdom and the euro zone we use the discount rate obtained from an analysis of aa graded corporate bonds used to generate a yield curve 
for other countries or regions without a corporate aa bond market  government bond rates are used 
our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long term high quality debt securities  as well as the duration of our plans liabilities 
inflation assumptions are based upon both actual inflation rates and nationally expected trends 
the expected rates of return on plan assets are derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies  expected long term performance of asset classes  risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy 
these rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions  but because they are long term in nature  short term market changes do not significantly impact the rates 
changes to our target asset allocation also impact these rates 
retirement rates are based upon actual and projected plan experience 
mortality rates are based on published actuarial tables relevant to the countries in which we have plans 
the expected rates of compensation increase reflect estimates of the change in future compensation levels due to general price levels  seniority  age and other factors 
health care cost trend rates are developed based upon historical retiree cost trend data  long term health care outlook and industry benchmarks 
we evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations  cash flow requirements and other factors 
we discuss our funding assumptions with the finance committee of our board of directors 
valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets the initial recording of goodwill and intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets 
we test the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of december each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired 
the test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units 
in connection with our segment reorganization in  we reallocated goodwill to our redefined reporting units and evaluated goodwill for impairment 
the identification of our reporting units began at the operating segment level epd  ipd and fcd  and considered whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for purpose of testing goodwill for impairment based on certain conditions 
these conditions included  among other factors  i the extent to which a component represents a business and ii the aggregation of economically similar components within the operating segments and resulted in nine reporting units 
other factors that were considered in 
table of contents determining whether the aggregation of components was appropriate included the similarity of the nature of the products and services  the nature of the production processes  the methods of distribution and the types of industries served 
impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach  whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates  which are based on our budgets  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and market participants 
assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term business plan period 
we did not record an impairment of goodwill in  or we also consider our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill 
although our market capitalization declined compared with  it did not decline to a level that indicated a potential impairment of our goodwill as of december  impairment losses for indefinite lived intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value 
fair values are calculated for trademarks using a relief from royalty method  which estimates the fair value of the trademarks by determining the present value of the royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark 
this method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that have a significant impact on the fair value and are substantially consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units discussed above 
we did not record a material impairment of our trademarks in  or the net realizable value of other long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets  is reviewed periodically  when indicators of potential impairments are present  based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets  utilizing a methodology similar to that for goodwill 
additional considerations related to our long lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements  changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting developments we have presented the information about accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk exposure arising from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to financial instruments  including interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts  but we currently expect all counterparties will continue to meet their obligations given their current creditworthiness 
interest rate risk our earnings are impacted by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under our credit facilities  which bear interest based on floating rates 
at december   after the effect of interest rate swaps  we had million of variable rate debt obligations outstanding under our credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical change of basis points in the interest rate for these borrowings  assuming constant variable rate debt levels  would have changed interest expense by million for the year ended december  at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of notional amount in outstanding interest rate swaps with third parties with varying maturities through june foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial portion of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries outside of the us in currencies other than the us dollar 
almost all of our us subsidiaries conduct their business primarily in their local currencies  which are also their functional currencies 
foreign currency exposures arise from translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and from transactions  including firm commitments and anticipated transactions  denominated in a currency other than a non us subsidiary s functional currency 
generally  we view our investments in foreign subsidiaries from a long term perspective and  therefore  do not hedge these investments 
we use capital structuring techniques to manage our investment in 
table of contents foreign subsidiaries as deemed necessary 
we realized net losses gains associated with foreign currency translation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which are included in other comprehensive expense income 
we employ a foreign currency risk management strategy to minimize potential changes in cash flows from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 
where available  the use of forward exchange contracts allows us to mitigate transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the forward exchange contracts will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
our policy allows foreign currency coverage only for identifiable foreign currency exposures  and changes in the fair values of these instruments are included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
as of december   we had a us dollar equivalent of million in aggregate notional amount outstanding in forward exchange contracts with third parties  compared with million at december  transactional currency gains and losses arising from transactions outside of our sites functional currencies and changes in fair value of certain forward exchange contracts are included in our consolidated results of operations 
we recognized net foreign currency gains losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which are included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
see discussion of the impact in of the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
based on a sensitivity analysis at december   a change in the foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december  would have impacted our net earnings by approximately million  due primarily to the euro 
this calculation assumes that all currencies change in the same direction and proportion relative to the us dollar and that there are no indirect effects  such as changes in non us dollar sales volumes or prices 
this calculation does not take into account the impact of the foreign currency forward exchange contracts discussed above
