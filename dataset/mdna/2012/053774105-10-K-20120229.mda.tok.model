item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
unless otherwise noted  all dollar amounts in tables are in millions and those relating to our results of operations are presented before taxes 
we operate two of the most recognized brands in the global vehicle rental industry  avis and budget 
we provide car and truck rentals and ancillary services to businesses and consumers worldwide 
in conjunction with the october acquisition of avis europe plc avis europe and the avis europe acquisition and our increased global presence  we re aligned components of our operating structure 
we now operate in the following business segments north america provides car rentals in the united states and vehicle rentals in canada  as well as related products and services 
international provides  and licenses the company s brands to third parties for  vehicle rentals and ancillary products and services in europe  the middle east  asia  africa  south america  central america  the caribbean  australia and new zealand 
truck rental provides truck rentals and related services to consumers and commercial users in the united states 
our revenues are derived principally from car and truck rentals in our company owned operations and include i time and mileage t m fees charged to our customers for vehicle rentals  ii reimbursement from our customers for certain operating expenses we incur  including gasoline and vehicle licensing fees  as well as airport concession fees  which we pay in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations  and iii sales of loss damage waivers and insurance and rentals of navigation units and other items in conjunction with vehicle rentals 
we also earn royalty revenue from our licensees in conjunction with their vehicle rental transactions 
car rental volumes are closely associated with the travel industry  particularly airline passenger volumes  or enplanements 
because we generate a significant portion of our revenue from our on airport operations  we expect that our ability to generate revenue growth will be somewhat dependent on increases in worldwide enplanements 
our ability to achieve profit margins consistent with prior periods remains dependent on our ability to successfully manage our costs and our revenues per vehicle 
our vehicle rental operations are seasonal 
historically  the third quarter of the year has been our strongest quarter due to the increased level of leisure travel and household moving activity 
any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during the third quarter could have a disproportionate adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have a partially variable cost structure and routinely adjust the size and  therefore  the cost of our rental fleet in response to fluctuations in demand 
however  certain expenses  such as rent  are fixed and cannot be reduced in response to seasonal fluctuations in our operations 
we believe that the following factors  among others  may affect and or impact our financial condition and results of operations worldwide enplanements  fleet  pricing  marketing and strategic decisions made by us and by our competitors  changes in per unit car fleet costs and in conditions in the used vehicle marketplace  changes in borrowing costs and in market willingness to purchase corporate and vehicle related debt  our acquisition of avis europe and our ability to successfully integrate its business and realize synergies  
table of contents changes in foreign exchange rates  and demand for truck rentals 
we believe that the worldwide economic recovery during and has been modest  and that demand for vehicle rental services has remained below levels seen prior to the recession 
historically  our results of operations have declined during periods of general economic weakness 
if economic conditions in the countries in which we operate were to weaken  our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted in and beyond 
as discussed further below  vehicle depreciation costs in declined significantly compared to amid a particularly strong used car market in the united states in  we do not expect that such strength will continue into at the same levels that existed following the march earthquake in japan 
in our cost reduction initiatives and restructuring activities  we are driving process improvements to reduce costs  enhance service to our customers and improve our operations 
in connection with the avis europe acquisition  we incurred incremental indebtedness  which will have a material impact on our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we may pursue future acquisitions or investments and could incur additional indebtedness to help fund such transactions  which could have a material impact on our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
due to uncertainties related to our business  there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the covenants contained in our senior credit facilities and our asset backed car rental conduit facilities 
failure to comply with such covenants could significantly impact our liquidity if we were unable to obtain an amendment or waiver or were unable to refinance or replace such facilities 
see risk factors risks related to our indebtedness 
there can also be no assurance that results will be indicative of results we will achieve in or other future periods 
results of operations discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
the results of operations of north america and international for all periods presented have been recast to conform to the current alignment of our reportable segments 
the north america segment now includes our vehicle rental operations in canada 
our canadian operations were previously a component of our international segment 
we measure performance using the following key operating statistics i rental days  which represents the total number of days or portion thereof a vehicle was rented  and ii t m revenue per rental day  which represents the average daily revenue we earned from rental and mileage fees charged to our customers 
our car rental operating statistics rental days and t m revenue per rental day are all calculated based on the actual rental of the vehicle during a hour period 
we believe that this methodology  while conservative  provides our management with the most relevant statistics in order to manage the business 
our calculation may not be comparable to other companies calculation of similarly titled statistics 
our chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources based upon the separate financial information from the company s operating segments see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and adjusted ebitda  which we define as income from continuing operations before non vehicle related depreciation and amortization  any impairment charge  transaction related costs  non vehicle related interest and income taxes 
during  management revised the manner in which it evaluates its operating results by excluding transaction related costs from adjusted ebitda for all periods presented 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

table of contents year ended december  vs 
year ended december  our consolidated results of operations comprised the following year ended december  change net revenues total expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss during  our net revenues increased million  with approximately half of our revenue growth due to the avis europe acquisition in fourth quarter and the inclusion of its revenue  in our results 
for the year  we achieved a increase in t m revenue driven by an increase of in north american and international car rental days and a increase in truck rental days 
the growth in revenues also includes a increase in our ancillary revenues  such as sales of loss damage waivers and insurance products  gps navigation unit rentals  gasoline sales and fees charged to customers  and a million favorable effect related to the translation of our international results into us dollars 
total expenses increased million  with approximately half of the increase due to the results of avis europe 
the total expense increase was due to i our million increase in direct operating expenses largely resulting from costs associated with the increase in car rental days  ii a million increase in transaction related costs primarily for due diligence and other costs related to the avis europe acquisition  including a million non cash charge related to the unfavorable license rights we reacquired and million of losses on foreign currency transactions related to the avis europe acquisition  iii a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily because of the avis europe acquisition and our strategic decision to invest in incremental advertising and marketing  as well as increased agency commissions and other costs related to higher rental volumes  and iv a million increase in interest expense on corporate debt due to increased indebtedness  primarily related to avis europe acquisition 
these year over year increases were partially offset by i a million decrease in vehicle depreciation and lease charges resulting from a decline in our per unit depreciation  which include gains on sale of vehicles  ii the absence of the prior year million expense related to the extinguishment of a portion of our corporate debt and associated interest rate swaps  and iii an million decrease in vehicle interest expense 
our expenses also include a million adverse impact from foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result of these items  and a million increase in our provision for income taxes  we incurred a net loss of million

in  we incurred million of transaction related costs related to our previous efforts to acquire dollar thrifty 
north america revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  during compared with revenues increased primarily due to higher rental volumes  partially offset by decreased pricing 
the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher revenue and lower fleet costs 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the total revenue increase includes a million increase related to foreign currency exchange rates and was largely offset in adjusted ebitda by the opposite impact on expenses of million 
the increase in t m revenue was principally the result of a increase in rental days  partially offset by a decrease in t m revenue per day 
the million increase in ancillary revenues reflects i a million increase in ancillary revenues from gps rentals  sales of loss damage waivers and insurance products  emergency road service and other items  reflecting a increase on a per rental day basis  ii a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenue  which was partially offset in adjusted ebitda by million higher airport concession and vehicle licensing fees remitted to airport and other regulatory agencies  and iii a million increase in gasoline sales  which was more than offset in adjusted ebitda by million higher gasoline expense 
while we continued to achieve significant benefits from our cost saving initiatives  adjusted ebitda reflected a million increase in operating expenses  primarily related to i a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses principally due to our strategic decision to invest in incremental advertising  marketing and selling expenditures  as well as higher variable costs related to increased rental volumes  ii a million increase in certain other expenses related to increased volumes  including agency operator commissions  maintenance and damage  shuttling  credit card fees  and other related costs  and iii a million increase in employee costs  rents and other expenses related primarily to increased staffing levels due to volume and inflationary increases 

table of contents adjusted ebitda benefited from i million decreased fleet depreciation and lease charges  reflecting a improvement in per unit fleet costs  including significant gains on sale of vehicles amid a particularly strong used car market for the better part of  partially offset by an increase in the average size of our car rental fleet  and ii a million decrease in vehicle interest expense due to lower interest rates on our vehicle debt 
international revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  during compared to primarily due to the avis europe acquisition during fourth quarter  movements in currency exchange rates and increased rental volumes 
the avis europe acquisition contributed million to revenue and had no effect on adjusted ebitda in the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the total increase in revenue includes a million increase related to foreign currency exchange rates  impacting t m revenue by million and ancillary revenues by million  and was largely offset in adjusted ebitda by the opposite impact on expenses of million 
the increase in t m revenue was principally driven by an increase in rental days  mainly due to the inclusion of the revenues after the acquisition  and a increase in t m revenue per rental day the increase in pricing was entirely the result of the foreign currency exchange rate effects 
the increase in ancillary revenues reflects i a million increase from gps rentals  sales of loss damage waivers  insurance products and other items  ii a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  which was more than offset in adjusted ebitda by million of higher airport concession and vehicle licensing fees remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities  and iii a million increase in gasoline sales  which was principally offset in adjusted ebitda by million higher gasoline expense 
adjusted ebitda reflected a million increase in operating expenses and a million increase in fleet depreciation and lease charges 
these increases were principally due to the avis europe acquisition  which added to our operating locations  headcount  fleet and other operating expenses  as well as increased advertising  marketing and sales commissions  inflationary increases in rent and modestly higher per unit fleet costs 
truck rental revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with revenues increased as a result of a increase in rental days  primarily from increased commercial volume  while t m revenue per day decreased 
the increase in rental days and the decrease in average daily rate both reflect our successful initiative to increase commercial rental volumes  which carry a lower average daily rate but a longer length of rental which helped us increase vehicle utilization in adjusted ebitda benefited from the increase in revenue and an million decline in fleet depreciation  interest and lease charges  reflecting a decline in per unit fleet costs and a decline in our average truck rental fleet 
the increase in adjusted ebitda was partially offset by a million increase in maintenance and damage expenditures due to increased rental volumes and incremental vehicle repairs 
corporate and other revenues decreased million and adjusted ebitda increased million in compared with adjusted ebitda increased primarily due to a decrease in professional services fees

this increase in ancillary revenue was partially offset by a decrease in t m revenue in our car rental operations  resulting primarily from a decline in north america and international car rental days partially mitigated by a increase in t m revenue per rental day 
in addition  the increase in revenue reflected a million favorable effect related to the translation of our international operations results into us dollars

the year over year change in revenue was comprised of a million decrease in t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary and other revenues 
the decrease in t m revenue was principally the result of a decrease in rental days  entirely in the first half of the year  and a decrease in t m revenue per day 
the increase in ancillary revenue was primarily due to i a million increase in sales of loss damage waivers  insurance products and emergency roadside services  and fees charged to customers  ii a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenue  partially offset in adjusted ebitda by million of higher airport concession and vehicle licensing fees remitted to airport and other regulatory agencies  and iii an million increase in gasoline sales  which was more than offset in adjusted ebitda by million of higher gasoline expense

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we present separately the financial data of our vehicle programs 
these programs are distinct from our other activities as the assets under vehicle programs are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets 
the income generated by these assets is used  in part  to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt 
cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our vehicle programs 
we believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of our vehicle programs because  ultimately  the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets

our liquidity position may be negatively affected by financial market disruptions or a downturn in the us and worldwide economies  which may result in unfavorable conditions in the vehicle rental industry  in the asset backed financing market  and in the credit markets generally 
we believe these factors have affected and could affect the debt ratings assigned to us by credit rating agencies and the cost of our borrowings 
additionally  a downturn in the worldwide economy or a disruption in the credit markets could impact our liquidity due to i decreased demand and pricing for vehicles in the used vehicle market  ii increased costs associated with  and or reduced capacity or increased collateral needs under  our financings  iii the adverse impact of vehicle manufacturers  including general motors company  ford motor company  chrysler llc  psa peugeot citro n  volkswagen group  kia motors america  inc  hyundai motor america  toyota motor corporation  renault  sa  mitsubishi motors corporation and fiat group automobiles spa being unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to repurchase or guarantee the depreciation on the related program vehicles  iv disruption in our ability to obtain financing due to negative credit events specific to us or affecting the overall debt market  v the impact of an insolvency event or actual or potential default by any of the financial guaranty firms that have insured a portion of our outstanding vehicle backed debt and vi the effect of any of realogy  wyndham or travelport being unable or unwilling to honor their respective obligations under the separation agreement and the tax sharing agreement 
financial guaranty firms ambac assurance corporation and assured guaranty corp 
currently provide financial guaranties for approximately million expiring in and million expiring in  respectively  of our us term asset backed car rental financing 
certain insolvency events by these financial guarantors would result in principal of the related financings being required to be repaid sooner than anticipated 

table of contents our liquidity position also may be negatively affected if we are unable to remain in compliance with the financial and other covenants associated with our senior credit facilities and other borrowings 
the financial covenants of our senior credit facilities include maximum leverage and minimum coverage ratio requirements 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants in our senior credit facilities

c operating lease obligations are presented net of sublease rentals to be received see note to our consolidated financial statements 
d represents commitments to purchase vehicles  the majority of which are from ford motor company  general motors company and chrysler group llc 
these commitments are generally subject to the vehicle manufacturers satisfying their obligations under the repurchase and guaranteed depreciation agreements 
the purchase of such vehicles is generally financed through financings under vehicle programs in addition to cash received upon the sale of vehicles  many of which were purchased under repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs see note to our consolidated financial statements 
e primarily represents income tax uncertainties  million of which is subject to indemnification by realogy and wyndham

for more information regarding guarantees and indemnifications  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting policies critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events and or events that are outside of our control 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require 
table of contents subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
we have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
in performing this review  we are required to make an assessment of fair value for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
when determining fair value  we utilize various consistent assumptions  including the fair market trading price of our common stock and management s projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause the fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated among our reporting units 
during  and  there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
business combinations 
the company uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations  which requires that the purchase price of acquired companies be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  as applicable  at their respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
our assessment of the purchase price allocation and the related fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets 
examples of critical valuation assumptions used by management include projected future cash flows  the estimated weighted average cost of capital and market royalty rates 
we believe that our estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and  in part  on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  and actual results could differ from those assumptions 
vehicles 
we present vehicles at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  on the consolidated balance sheets 
we record the initial cost of the vehicle net of incentives and allowances from manufactures 
we acquire our rental vehicles either through repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs with certain automobile manufacturers or outside of such programs 
for rental vehicles purchased under such programs  we depreciate the vehicles such that the net book value on the date of sale or return to the manufacturers is intended to equal the contractual guaranteed residual values 
for vehicles acquired outside of manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs  we depreciate based on the vehicles estimated residual market values and their expected dates of disposition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent results of operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
currently we do not record valuation allowances on the majority of our tax loss carryforwards as there are adequate deferred tax liabilities that could be realized within the carryforward period 

table of contents we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and to record the related assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
pursuant to the tax sharing agreement entered into in connection with the separation of cendant corporation  as we were previously known  into four separate companies the separation  and the separation agreement  we are entitled to indemnification for non avis budget car rental tax contingencies for taxable periods prior to and including the separation 
the rules governing taxation are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
therefore  our tax accruals reflect a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions supporting our tax accruals are reasonable  the potential result of an audit or litigation related to tax could include a range of outcomes  and could result in tax liabilities for us that are materially different than those reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes 
financial instruments 
we estimate fair values for each of our financial instruments  including derivative instruments 
most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on an organized exchange 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we must develop an estimate of fair value using dealer quotes  present value cash flow models  option pricing models or other valuation methods  as appropriate 
the use of these fair value techniques involves significant judgments and assumptions  including estimates of future interest rate levels based on interest rate yield curves  credit spreads of the company and counterparties  volatility factors  and an estimation of the timing of future cash flows 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements  which are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  hedge accounting requires that  at the beginning of each hedge period  we justify an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items will be highly effective 
this effectiveness assessment  which is performed at least quarterly  involves an estimation of changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates  as well as the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges 
the use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of the effect of hypothetical changes to these assumptions 
public liability  property damage and other insurance liabilities 
insurance liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets include supplemental liability insurance  personal effects protection insurance  public liability  property damage and personal accident insurance claims for which we are self insured 
we estimate the required liability of such claims on an undiscounted basis utilizing an actuarial method that is based upon various assumptions which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents and changes in the ultimate cost per incident

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and gasoline prices 
the avis europe acquisition has increased our foreign currency exchange risks 
we manage our exposure to market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  futures and options contracts  to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related to our debt  foreign currency forwards to manage and reduce foreign currency exchange rate risk  and derivative commodity instruments to manage and reduce the risk of changing unleaded gasoline prices 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk related to our use of derivatives through specific minimum credit standards  diversification of counterparties  and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience providing such derivative instruments 
our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
for additional information regarding our borrowings and financial instruments  see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk management we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  euro and the new zealand dollar 
we use foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency swaps to manage foreign exchange risk that arises from certain intercompany transactions and from non functional currency denominated assets and liabilities and earnings denominated in non us dollar currencies 
our foreign currency forward contracts are often not designated as hedges and therefore changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings as they occur 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact on earnings  cash flows and fair values based on a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation in the value of the underlying currencies being hedged  against the us dollar at december  with all other variables held constant  a hypothetical change increase or 
table of contents decrease in foreign currency exchange rates would have an approximately million effect on our earnings at december  because unrealized gains or losses related to foreign currency forward and swap contracts are expected to be offset by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying exposures being hedged  when combined  these foreign currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk management our primary interest rate exposure at december  was interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we use interest rate swaps and caps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
we anticipate that libor and commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
based on our interest rate derivatives as of december   we estimate that a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our earnings 
because gains or losses related to interest rate derivatives are expected to be offset by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying exposures being hedged  when combined  these interest rate contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
commodity risk management we have commodity price exposure related to fluctuations in the price of unleaded gasoline 
we anticipate that such commodity risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we determined that a hypothetical change in the price of unleaded gasoline  would not have a material impact on our earnings at december
