you should specifically consider the various risk factors identified in this filing that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
executive overview what were our key financial results our net sales in increased to million compared to million in  including a increase in net sales of converted product and a decrease in parent roll sales 
our converted product business gained significant momentum during  with net sales increasing every quarter during this resulted in converted product net sales of million in the fourth quarter of  which was a new quarterly record and represented a increase over the prior year quarter 
our earnings per diluted common share in increased to per diluted common share compared with per diluted common share in our ebitda in increased to million compared to million in we continued our trend of positive operating cash flow in of million 
we have generated positive operating cash flow each of the last ten years 
what did we focus on in in  we focused on selling new capacity from our converting line which was put into production at the end of the second quarter of and increased our converting capacity by approximately million cases 
as a result  our converted product business gained significant momentum during and shipments increased each quarter during the year as we began to broaden our product offering and began placing mid tier products with certain of our customers 
we achieved a new record for converted product net sales in the fourth quarter of at million 
we would not have been able to achieve this level of converted product sales without the capacity associated with our new converting line 
these efforts allowed us to ship  cases in  an increase over cases shipped in  and to produce  cases in  an increase over cases produced in we also focused considerable efforts on controlling production costs while improving quality attributes  such as bathroom tissue softness  to supplement the higher product quality production capabilities of the new converting line 
these efforts will continue in as we continue our expansion into the mid tier market 
what challenges and opportunities did our business face in the price of recycled fiber  our primary cost component in the production of parent rolls  presented a challenge during recycled fiber prices rose significantly during the second and third quarters of before decreasing significantly in the fourth quarter of on a year over year basis  fiber prices increased in compared to due to a very competitive environment  we were unable to increase selling prices during to compensate for the increased fiber costs and as a result  our gross profit margins were reduced 
we also incurred higher than normal repairs and maintenance expense in our paper mill due to equipment repairs 
we improved the efficiency of our equipment in our converting plant during  particularly following the start up of our new converting line 
this helped reduce our converting production costs per case by compared to those experienced in 
table of contents what will we focus on in in  we will continue to focus our sales efforts on obtaining new business to fill out our converting capacity 
we intend to focus our sales efforts on the mid tier and premium tier product categories and to broaden our customer base  as well as take advantage of strategic opportunities with existing customers 
through our new product development efforts  we have positioned ourselves to produce higher quality tissue products with attractive cost characteristics that provide good price points for retailers and good value for consumers 
our converted product shipments in the last half of totaled approximately million cases and increased each quarter during in  we intend to build upon the momentum achieved during to further increase our converted product sales 
annual capacity of our converting plant is approximately million cases  we believe we can effectively use and of this capacity while maintaining a high level of customer service 
our paper making operation will continue to work on quality improvement to provide enhanced product attributes for our converting operation  which will aid in our sales efforts to penetrate the higher quality mid tier market 
we will continue to focus on optimizing our existing operating assets in both converting and paper mill operations 
specific emphasis will be placed on maximizing the efficiency of our new converting line 
emphasis will continue to be placed on identifying root causes of issues that impede productivity and to identify ways to improve our overall production costs 
business overview we are an integrated manufacturer of tissue products serving the private label consumer  or at home  tissue market 
we produce bulk tissue paper  known as parent rolls  and convert parent rolls into finished products  including paper towels  bathroom tissue and paper napkins 
we sell any remaining parent rolls to other converters 
our core customer base consists of dollar stores and other discount retailers 
by dollar stores  we mean retailers that offer a limited selection across a broad range of products at everyday low prices in a smaller store format 
we have focused on the dollar stores which are also referred to as value retailers and the broader discount retail market because of their overall market growth  their consistent order patterns and low number of stock keeping units skus 
the at home tissue market consists of several quality levels  including a value tier  mid tier and premium tier 
our historical growth has focused on the value tier  primarily due to the dollar stores concentration of product offerings in that market and  to some extent  limitations of certain manufacturing equipment 
as part of our growth strategy  we began to systematically invest in manufacturing assets to expand our product offerings and strengthen our position as a low cost manufacturer 
this process began with the investment in a new paper machine in which provided the opportunity to produce parent rolls for value tier  mid tier and premium tier converted products 
further  we undertook an expansion project which included the purchase and installation of a new converting line and the construction of a new converted product warehouse in mid this project had three main objectives increase the capacity of our converting operation  provide the capability to produce higher quality mid tier converted products and reduce warehousing costs by centralizing all warehousing and shipping 
all of our converted product revenue is derived pursuant to truck load purchase orders from our customers 
parent roll revenue is derived from purchase orders that generally cover a one month time period 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our customers 
because our product is a daily consumable item  the order stream from our customer base is fairly consistent with no significant seasonal fluctuations 
however  we do experience some mild seasonal softness in the first and fourth quarters of each year  primarily due to the effects of winter weather on consumers buying habits and occasional effects of holidays on shipping schedules 
changes in the national economy  in general  do not materially affect the market for our converted products 

table of contents our profitability depends on several key factors  including the market price of our product  the cost of fiber used in producing paper  the efficiency of operations in both our paper mill and converting facility  and the cost of energy 
the private label market of the tissue industry is highly competitive  and discount retail customers are extremely price sensitive 
as a result  it is difficult to effect price increases 
we expect these competitive conditions to continue 
at present  our parent roll production capacity exceeds the requirements of our converting operation 
as result  we have excess parent rolls that we sell into the open market 
our strategy is to sell all of the parent rolls we manufacture as converted products which generally carry higher margins than parent rolls 
the total capacity of our eleven converting lines is approximately million cases 
we estimate that at million cases of annual production  we will consume all of our parent roll production in our converting operation and therefore any production beyond that estimate will result in the need to purchase parent rolls on the open market

net sales of converted product increased million  or  in the year ended december   to million compared to million in net sales of parent rolls decreased million  or  in  to million compared to million in the increase in converted product sales was primarily due to an increase in converting tonnage shipped and a increase in net selling prices per ton in compared to the increased tonnage shipped was primarily due to new products sold to existing customers  which were primarily mid tier products  and increased sales of existing products 
the decrease in parent roll sales was due to a decrease in parent rolls shipped being partially offset by an increase in the net sales price per ton 
the decrease in parent roll shipments was primarily due to increased paper requirements in our converting operation due to the increase in converted product shipments

table of contents million when compared to the same period in the decrease in converted product sales was primarily due to lower converted product shipment volumes of in the year compared to the year 
net selling prices per ton in were slightly unfavorable with those experienced in  lower by approximately 
the lower converted product shipment volumes were primarily the result of continued aggressive promotional pricing by branded producers which negatively affected our shipment volumes with certain customers 
parent roll sales benefited from the lower requirements of our converting operations which resulted in more excess parent roll tons being available for sale 
the increase in parent roll sales was mainly due to an increase in tonnage shipped and to a lesser extent  a increase in net sales price per ton

cost of sales as a percent of net sales was negatively affected by the higher fiber costs and higher depreciation costs  which were partially offset by the effects of increased converted product shipments and lower converting production costs 
paper production costs were per ton in the year ended december   an increase of per ton compared to per ton in the period 
paper production costs increased primarily due to higher fiber prices and higher maintenance expenses 
our cost of fiber in the year ended december  increased approximately compared to the same period of  which increased our cost of sales by approximately million 
fiber prices began to rise in the second quarter of and continued to rise through the third quarter of before dropping substantially during the fourth quarter of depreciation expense increased primarily due to placing into service the assets associated with our converting expansion project in the beginning of the third quarter of converting production costs were favorable to the prior year due to lower overhead spending  the effects of increased converted product shipments on cost absorption and improved efficiencies in our converting plant 
overhead costs were favorably affected by the elimination of approximately million in external warehousing costs in the year compared to the year due to the completion of our own onsite warehouse 
usage of a third party warehouse ended in september and we have been warehousing and shipping all converted product from our pryor  oklahoma location since that time 

table of contents cost of sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million in the year ended december  this increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to higher cost of fiber  higher converted products costs and higher depreciation expense  which was partially offset by decreased external warehouse expense

cost of sales as a percent of net sales was negatively affected by higher paper production costs and an unfavorable sales mix shift from converted products to parent rolls 
paper production costs were per ton in the year ended december   an increase of per ton compared to per ton in the period 
paper production costs increased primarily due to higher fiber prices 
our cost of fiber in the year ended december  increased approximately compared to the same period of  which increased our cost of sales by approximately million 
following a sharp decrease in fiber prices in the first half of  fiber prices began to rise in the third quarter of and continued to rise through mid year fiber prices remained flat during the last half of depreciation expense increased primarily due to placing the assets associated with our converting expansion project into service in the beginning of the third quarter of largely due to lower converting production requirements and  to a lesser extent  additional staffing for our new converting line  converting production costs increased in the year compared with the same period of external warehousing costs decreased by approximately  in the year compared to the year due to the phasing out of a third party warehouse during the third quarter of gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to million in the year ended december   compared to million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in compared to in the gross profit decrease was primarily due to higher fiber prices and higher depreciation expense  being partially offset by higher converted product shipments and lower converting production costs 
as a result of the increased converted product sales  more tonnage was sold as converted products rather than parent rolls

our oklahoma tax obligation was satisfied by our oitc associated with our investment in a new paper machine and our converting expansion project as well as other capital equipment investments 
liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the liquid financial assets available to fund our business operations and pay for near term obligations 
these liquid financial assets consist of cash and short term investments 
our cash requirements have historically been satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations and debt financings 
on july   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which included the exercise in full of the underwriter s option to purchase  shares of common stock to cover over allotments 
net proceeds from the offering were million 
following the offering   shares of common stock  par value 
per share  were outstanding 
in july  we effected a for stock split increasing the shares of common stock outstanding to  shares outstanding 
we completed the public offering primarily to help implement our strategy to eliminate our need at that time to purchase paper from third party suppliers through the purchase and installation of a new paper machine 
the funding from the public offering  additional bank financing and cash flow from operations funded the million project 
in  we completed a follow on stock offering that provided million in net proceeds 
the offering consisted of the sale of  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the offering along with cash from operations  and a construction loan to fund a million converting expansion project  comprised of a million new converting line and a million new finished goods warehouse 
as of december   we had cash on hand of million and million in short term investments  compared to  and million as of december   respectively 
on february   we initiated a quarterly cash dividend policy  dividends of million  or per outstanding share of our common stock  were authorized and paid during the year ended december  the dividend policy was approved and the initial payment amount established based on our board of directors review of our expected future cash flows  our balance sheet leverage and future capital requirements 
our board will evaluate the appropriate dividend payment on a quarterly basis 
while we expect to continue to declare quarterly dividends  the payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors and the timing and amount of any future dividends will depend upon earnings  cash requirements and financial condition of the company 
capital expenditures are estimated at million in for normal recurring capital expenses

the receivable resulted from the extension of the eligibility period for bonus depreciation  which eliminated our federal tax liability for the extension occurred after deposits of million were made for the first three quarters of in addition  we estimated a federal tax loss for  resulting in a million carryforward 
a refund of the million overpayment was received in the first quarter of the following table summarizes key cash flow information for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows provided by operating activities increased from million in to million in primarily due to higher cash earnings and the receipt of a million income tax refund as discussed above being partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory levels due to the increased converted product business 
cash flows provided by used in investing activities increased million in to million cash inflow compared to million cash outflow in  primarily due to million in proceeds from the sale of investment securities in  which were used to lower our level of outstanding debt during our refinancing in april  compared to million in  offset by million of capital expenditures in compared to million in capital project expenditures for included million for the new converting line  million for the finished goods warehouse and million for the expansion of the waste water treatment plant 
cash flows used in financing activities were million in  primarily attributable to the company s debt refinancing  in which we repaid million of long term debt and million on our revolving credit line  assisted by borrowing million at lower interest rates and more flexible terms 
additionally  we paid million of dividends to stockholders in cash flows provided by financing activities in was million  primarily due to million of additional borrowings  offset by million of debt repayments 
cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from million in to million in a decrease in cash earnings of million and a million income tax receivable were the main drivers 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased million in  primarily due to million in sales of investment securities compared to million in net purchases in capital expenditures increased million from million in to million in the sale of the securities provided funding for a portion of our converting expansion project 
capital project expenditures for consisted of million for the new converting line  million for the finished goods warehouse and million for the expansion of the waste water treatment plant 
cash flows provided by financing activities was million in  primarily attributable to million in borrowings under a construction loan for the warehouse portion of the converting expansion project  million in net borrowings on the revolving credit line which were partially offset by million in principal payments on our bank term loans 

table of contents on april   the company paid off the remaining unmatured loans under our existing credit facility which totaled million and entered into a new million credit agreement the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase consisting of the following an million revolving credit line due april  a million real estate term loan with a year term due april and amortized as if it had a year life  and a million machinery and equipment term loan with a year term due july and amortized as if it had a year life 
the credit agreement has the effect of i extending and increasing the company s revolving line of credit from million to million  ii refinancing and extending the company s current million term loan to a million term loan and iii refinancing and extending the company s two construction loans of million into a single million term loan 
under the terms of the credit agreement  amounts outstanding will bear interest  at the company s election  at the prime rate with a floor of the adjusted one month libor rate  as defined in the credit facility agreement or libor  plus a margin 
the margin for the revolver and term loan is based on the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio  and is adjusted quarterly 
the margin ranges from negative basis points to basis points for prime rate loans and from basis points to basis points for libor rate loans 
the margin for term loan is fixed at basis points over libor 
obligations under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the credit agreement contains representations and warranties  and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type  including  but not limited to  limitations on additional borrowings  additional investments and asset sales  and maximum annual capital expenditures of million 
we believe the most significant covenants under our credit facility are the funded debt to ebitda ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum tangible net worth 
the table below compares the actual ratios with the limits specified in the credit agreement 
actual as of required in credit agreement excess funded debt to ebitda ratio fixed charge coverage ratio tangible net worth under the terms of the credit agreement  base tangible net worth is million and increases each fiscal year by of positive net income for the fiscal year 
the amount available under the revolving credit line may be reduced in the event that our borrowing base  which is based upon qualified receivables  qualified inventory  and equipment with a value up to a maximum of million  is less than million 
as of december   our qualified receivables were million and our qualified inventory was million  which  when added to the million of equipment availability yielded a total borrowing base of million and consequently the full million revolving credit facility was not available to us 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit line at december  contractual obligations as of december   our contractual cash obligations were our long term debt and associated interest  and natural gas contract 
we do not have any material leasing commitments or debt

maturities of these contractual obligations consist of the following payments due by period years contractual cash obligations total and and after in thousands long term debt interest payments natural gas contract total under our revolving credit and term loan agreements  the maturity of outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with our loan covenants 
our long term debt carries interest at variable rates 
these amounts have been calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december   which were for term loan and for term loan in october  we entered into a contract to purchase  mmbtu per year of natural gas requirements at per mmbtu plus a per mmbtu management fee for the period from april through march subsequently  the agreement has been extended as follows period mmbtus price per mmbtu management fee per mmbtu april march april march april march april december april september additional  month october march additional  month april december additional  month if we are unable to purchase the contracted amounts and the market price at that time is less than the contracted price  we would be obligated under the terms of our agreement to reimburse an amount equal to the difference between the contracted amount and the amount actually purchased  multiplied by the difference between our contract price and current spot price 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in significant off balance sheet liabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 

table of contents management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
our management must make estimates of accounts receivable that will not be collected 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s creditworthiness as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
trade receivables are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted  including  but not limited to  external third party collection efforts and litigation 
while such credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
accounts receivable balances that have been written off  net of recoveries  in the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
inventory 
our inventory consists of converted finished goods  bulk paper rolls and raw materials and is based on standard cost  specific identification  or fifo first in  first out 
standard costs approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
material  labor and factory overhead necessary to produce the inventories are included in the standard cost 
our management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on the age of the inventory and forecasts of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
our inventory is monitored each quarter and all potential obsolete items due to product appearance change were written off during the current year 
during the year ended december   we decreased the inventory valuation reserve by  the reserve requirement was lower at year end due to improved execution of new product packaging changes resulting in less unused and obsolete packaging 
during the year ended december   we increased the inventory valuation reserve by  new accounting pronouncements refer to the discussion of recently adopted issued accounting pronouncements under
