item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview depomed is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on neurology  pain and other diseases of the central nervous system 
we also have a portfolio of royalty and milestone producing assets based on our proprietary drug delivery technologies 
we have two products approved by the us food and drug administration fda that are currently being marketed 
gralise gabapentin is our once daily tablet for the management of postherpetic neuralgia that we launched and made commercially available in october glumetza is our once daily treatment for adults with type diabetes that is commercialized in the united states by santarus  inc santarus 
we also have two product candidates under clinical development  dm for parkinson s disease and serada for menopausal hot flashes 
significant developments during there were a number of significant developments in our business in  including the following in january  the fda approved gralise for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia 
this approval triggered a million milestone payment from a subsidiary of abbott laboratories that we received in february in march  we received all rights to gralise from abbott laboratories along with a settlement payment of million  and announced our intention to commercialize gralise in the united states 
in march  we entered into a license and services agreement with boehringer ingelheim  granting boehringer ingelheim a license to use our acuform drug delivery technology for use in combination metformin products 
in april  james a 
schoeneck was appointed as our president and chief executive officer  following the resignation of carl a 
pelzel  our former president and chief executive officer 
in june  we entered into a service agreement with ventiv commercial services  llc ventiv  to provide full time sales representatives dedicated to us to promote gralise 
in july  we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with ironwood pharmaceuticals  inc granting ironwood a license for worldwide rights to our acuform drug delivery technology for an undisclosed ironwood early stage development program 
in august  we entered into a commercialization agreement with santarus  superseding our promotion agreement with santarus  pursuant to which santarus assumed commercial  manufacturing and regulatory responsibility for the commercial activities of glumetza and agreed to pay us a royalties on net sales of in  in  in  and in and thereafter 
in september  we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with patheon puerto rico  inc patheon for the manufacture  package and supply of commercial quantities of gralise 
in october  we made gralise commercially available  began distributing gralise and began promoting gralise to physicians through our contract sales organization 
in december  august j 
moretti was appointed as senior vice president and chief financial officer 
mr 
moretti commenced employment with the company in january 
table of contents total revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  included a million milestone from abbott products 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  operating expenses for included a million gain on termination of our agreement with abbott related to gralise  which reduced operating expenses for the year 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million as of december   compared to million as of december  as a result of these developments  our results of operations in will differ significantly from our reported results for for example  in we recognized million in milestone revenue and a million gain on settlement with regard to termination of our agreement with abbott relating to gralise 
these were one time payments and will not recur in in  we reflect eight months of glumetza product revenue  cost of sales and corresponding promotion expense to santarus and four months of glumetza royalty revenue from santarus 
as a result of the restructuring of our agreement with santarus in august  we will recognize royalty revenue from santarus in but no product revenue or promotion expense for glumetza 
in  we recognized million of revenue from sales of gralise and a partial year of corresponding sales and marketing expense 
we expect to recognize a full year of gralise sales in and to incur a full year of sales and marketing expense in accordingly  we expect gralise product sales and selling  general and administrative expense to be substantially higher in than in critical accounting policies and estimates a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to financial statements  and the impact and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the footnotes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accrued liabilities  and use of estimates to be critical policies 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  and from license fees  milestones and royalties earned on license agreements and collaborative arrangements 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 

table of contents product sales gralise we sell gralise to wholesalers and retail pharmacies and began shipping to customers in october we accept returns of unsalable product from customers within a return period of six months prior to  and twelve months following product expiration 
gralise tablets currently have a shelf life of months from date of manufacture 
in october  we offered certain launch incentives for customers to stock gralise at pharmacies and wholesalers  which included discounts and extended payment terms 
given the limited history of prescriptions of gralise and launch incentives associated with stocking gralise  we currently cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment 
accordingly  we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of gralise until the right of return no longer exists  which occurs at the earlier of a the time gralise units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or b expiration of the right of return 
we estimate patient prescriptions dispensed using an analysis of third party information  primarily third party market research data and to a limited extent  information obtained from wholesalers with respect to inventory levels and inventory movement 
as a result of this policy  we have a deferred revenue balance of million at december  related to gralise product shipments that have not been recognized as revenue  which is net of wholesaler fees  retail pharmacy discounts  launch discounts and prompt payment discounts 
we recognized million in product sales  which is net of wholesaler fees  retail pharmacy discounts  prompt payment discounts  patient support programs  and government chargebacks and rebates for the year ended december  if the company underestimates or overestimates patient prescriptions dispensed for a given period  adjustments to revenue may be necessary in future periods 
we will recognize revenue upon the earlier of prescription units dispensed or expiration of the right of return until we can reliably estimate product returns  at which time we will record a one time increase in net revenue related to the recognition of revenue previously deferred 
glumetza we sold and recorded product sales on shipments of glumetza metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets to wholesalers and retail pharmacies through august the company and santarus entered into a commercialization agreement in august  under which we transferred the rights to manufacture and distribute glumetza in the united states to santarus 
santarus commenced distributing glumetza and began recording product sales in september until august  we recognized revenue for glumetza sales at the time title transferred to our customers  which occurred at the time product was delivered to our customers 
product distributed by us until august is subject to rights of return during the period commencing six months before and ending twelve months after product expiration 
revenue from sales of glumetza were recorded net of estimated allowances for returns  wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees  prompt pay discounts  patient discount programs  government rebates and chargebacks and managed care rebates 
product sales allowances we recognize product sales allowances as a reduction of product sales in the same period the related revenue is recognized 
product sales allowances are based on amounts owed or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration the terms of our agreements with customers  historical product returns  rebates or discounts taken  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel  the shelf life of the product  and specific known market events  such as competitive pricing and new product introductions 
if actual future results vary from our estimates  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on product sales and earnings in the period of adjustment 
our product sales allowances include product returns we allow customers to return product for credit on returned product that is within six months before and up to one year after its product expiration date 
wholesaler and retail pharmacy discounts we offer contractually determined discounts to certain wholesale distributors and retail pharmacies that purchase directly from us 
these 
table of contents discounts are either taken off invoice at the time of shipment or paid to the customer on a quarterly basis one to two months after the quarter in which product was shipped to the customer 
prompt pay discounts we offer cash discounts to our customers  generally of the sales price  as an incentive for prompt payment 
based on our experience  the company expects its customers to comply with the payment terms to earn the cash discount 
patient discount programs we offer discount card programs in which patients receive certain discounts off their prescription at participating retail pharmacies 
the discounts are reimbursed by the company approximately one month after the prescription subject to the discount is filled 
medicaid rebates we participate in medicaid rebate programs  which provide assistance to certain low income patients based on each individual state s guidelines regarding eligibility and services 
under the medicaid rebate programs  we pay a rebate to each participating state  generally two to three months after the quarter in which prescriptions subject to the rebate are filled 
chargebacks we provide discounts to authorized users of the federal supply schedule fss of the general services administration under an fss contract with the department of veterans affairs 
these federal entities purchase products from the wholesale distributors at a discounted price  and the wholesale distributors then charge back to us the difference between the current retail price and the price the federal entity paid for the product 
managed care rebates we offer discounts under contracts with certain managed care providers who do not purchase directly from us 
we generally pay managed care rebates one to two months after the quarter in which prescriptions subject to the rebate are filled 
medicare part d coverage gap rebates we participate in the medicare part d coverage gap discount program under which we provide rebates on prescriptions that fall within the donut hole coverage gap 
we generally pay medicare part d coverage gap rebates two to three months after the quarter in which prescriptions subject to the rebate are filled 
launch discounts we offered certain discounts in connection with the launch and commercially availability of gralise in october these launch discounts include off invoice discounts to wholesalers and stocking rebates to pharmacies for stocking gralise that were paid in november we believe our estimates related to gross to net sales adjustments for wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  prompt payment discounts  patient discount programs  launch discounts  managed care rebates  and other government chargebacks for gralise and glumetza do not have a high degree of estimation complexity or uncertainty as the related amounts are settled within a relatively short period of time 
we believe that our estimated product return allowances for glumetza require a high degree of judgment and are subject to change based on our experience and certain quantitative and qualitative factors 
we currently do not estimate returns for gralise 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began recognizing glumetza product sales at the time title transfers to our customer  and provide for an estimate of future product returns at that time 
we monitor actual return history on individual product lot basis since product launch  which provides us with a basis to reasonably estimate future product returns  taking into consideration the shelf life of product  shipment and prescription trends  estimated distribution channel inventory levels  and consideration of the introduction of competitive products 
the shelf life of the mg glumetza is currently months from the date of tablet manufacture 
on product launch in august and through the second quarter of  the shelf life of mg glumetza product shipped was months from the date of tablet manufacture 
the shelf life of the mg glumetza is currently 
table of contents to months from the date of tablet manufacture 
in  based on our review of actual product returns through the end of  we increased our estimate for glumetza product returns 
this resulted in a decrease of product sales of approximately million in related to sales made in prior periods 
because of the shelf life of glumetza product and our return policy of issuing credits on returned product that is within six months before and up to one year after its product expiration date  there may be a significant period of time between when the product is shipped and when we issue credits on returned product 
accordingly  we may have to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on product sales and earnings in the period of adjustments 
as part of our commercialization agreement with santarus  we are responsible for return allowances and credits with respect to glumetza product we shipped august and prior up to a contractual amount equal to our return reserve estimates at august  if returns allowances and credits on product we shipped come in higher than the contractual amount  santarus will be financially responsible for that difference 
if returns allowances and credits on product we shipped come in lower than the contractual amount  we will pay santarus of that remaining balance 
our product sales allowances and related accruals are evaluated each reporting period and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
such changes in estimate could affect our results of operations of financial position 

table of contents a rollforward of our product sales allowances for the three years ended december  is as follows in thousands contract sales discounts product returns cash discounts total balance at december  revenue allowances provision related to current period sales provision related to sales made in prior years recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period payments and credits related to sales made in prior periods balance at december  revenue allowances provision related to current period sales provision related to sales made in prior years recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period payments and credits related to sales made in prior periods balance at december  revenue allowances provision related to current period sales provision related to sales made in prior years recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period payments and credits related to sales made in prior periods balance at december  includes wholesaler fees and retail discounts  launch discounts  patient support programs  managed care rebates  and government chargebacks and rebates 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began recognizing glumetza product sales at the time title transfers to our customer  and began providing for an estimate of future product returns at that time 
through december   the company was unable to reasonably estimate expected returns of gralise at the time of shipment 
accordingly  the company currently defers recognition of revenue on product shipments of gralise  and deferred recognition of revenue prior to the third quarter of on product shipments of glumetza  until the earlier of when units were dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
product sales allowances related to revenue that has been deferred are recorded on the balance sheet as a reduction of the related deferred revenue  and recognized within the income statement as a reduction of product sales in the same period the related revenue is recognized 

table of contents license and collaborative arrangements revenue from license and collaborative arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations if any  of the licensee  is recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have substantially completed our obligations under the terms of the arrangement and our remaining involvement is inconsequential and perfunctory 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
license fee and collaborative payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
we recognize milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones if the milestone is substantive in nature  and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  the achievement relates to past performance and the fees are nonrefundable 
milestone payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
research and development expense and accruals research and development expenses include related salaries  clinical trial costs  consultant fees  supplies  manufacturing costs for research and development programs and allocations of corporate costs 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
these expenses result from our independent research and development efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations 
our expense accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received from clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
if possible  we obtain information regarding unbilled services directly from service providers 
however  we may be required to estimate these services based on information available to our product development or administrative staff 
if we underestimate or overestimate the activity associated with a study or service at a given point in time  adjustments to research and development expenses may be necessary in future periods 
historically  our estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred 
stock based compensation the company estimates the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option 
expected volatility 
the volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the options 
expected life of options 
beginning on january   the company uses historical option exercise data to estimate the expected life of the options 
prior to  the company s historical share option exercise experience did not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term because of a lack of sufficient data points  and the company estimated the expected term by using the weighted average terms of a peer group of companies that grant options with similar vesting provisions 
expected dividend yield 
the company has never paid any dividends and does not intend to in the near future 
as required  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future 
table of contents periods 
employee and director stock based compensation costs are to be recognized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line attribution method 
forfeitures are to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience

the increase in glumetza product sales in from was primarily driven by increased penetration of the mg glumetza in the metformin prescription market resulting from the promotion efforts by our promotion partner  santarus  conversion to the mg glumetza from the mg glumetza resulting from the voluntary mg glumetza recall  and price increases 
this was 
table of contents offset by lower product sales of the mg glumetza resulting from the voluntary mg glumetza recall in glumetza product sales in included returns of approximately million related to credits for returns given to customers on returns of recalled mg glumetza product  which had the effect of reducing product sales 
from october to august  glumetza was promoted by santarus 
from february through september  we promoted glumetza through a contract sales organization 
as a result of the santarus commercialization agreement entered into in august  we will no longer be recognizing glumetza product sales as we have transitioned the distribution and selling efforts related to glumetza to santarus 
we will receive royalties based upon an agreed upon percentage of santarus net sales of glumetza and will record these as royalty revenue 
gralise in october  we announced the commercial availability of gralise and began distributing gralise to wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of gralise until the right of return no longer exists  which occurs at the earlier of a the time gralise units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or b expiration of the right of return 
at december   we have a deferred revenue balance  which is classified as a liability on the balance sheet  of million associated with the deferral of revenue on gralise product shipments  which is net of estimated wholesaler fees  retail pharmacy discounts  stocking allowances and prompt payment discounts 
we will recognize revenue upon the earlier of prescription units dispensed or expiration of the right of return until we can reliably estimate product returns  at which time we will record a one time increase in net revenue related to the recognition of revenue previously deferred 
we expect gralise product sales to increase significantly in as compared to as only represented the first three months of selling gralise

we began receiving royalties from santarus in september  from valeant in the first quarter of and from lg in the first quarter of royalty revenue from santarus in was million and represented four months of santarus distributing and recording product sales on shipments of glumetza under the commercialization agreement 
there were no royalty revenue amounts from santarus in or we expect royalty revenue to increase in over as a result of a full year of royalties under our commercialization agreement with santarus in as compared to months in teva in april  we entered into a settlement and license agreement with teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc teva associated with our patent infringement lawsuit against teva affiliates ivax corporation and ivax pharmaceuticals  inc related to teva s generic glucophage xr tablets

in connection with the termination of the license agreement with abbott products in  we no longer have continuing obligations to abbott products 
accordingly  all remaining deferred revenue related to the million upfront license fee previously received from abbott products was fully recognized as revenue in march  resulting in immediate recognition of approximately million of license revenue 
the increase in gralise license and collaborative revenue in over relates to the million milestone payment from abbott products in june on fda acceptance of the nda for gralise for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia 
because the non refundable milestone was substantive in nature  achieved and based on past performance  the entire million was recognized as license revenue in the second quarter of glumetza in january  we achieved the first sales milestone under the promotion agreement with santarus related to net sales of glumetza reaching million for the month period ending january   which triggered a milestone payment to us from santarus of million  which we received in march as the milestone was achieved and related to past performance the entire million was recognized as milestone revenue in the first quarter of pursuant to the promotion agreement originally entered into in july  santarus paid us a million upfront fee 
the upfront payment received was originally being amortized as revenue ratably until october  which represented the estimated length of time our obligations existed under the promotion agreement related to manufacturing glumetza and paying santarus promotion fees on gross margin of glumetza 
the commercialization agreement in august superseded the promotion agreement and removed our manufacturing and promotion fee obligations 
the commercialization agreement includes obligations with respect to manufacturing and regulatory transition to santarus and managing the patent infringement lawsuits against sun and lupin

the costs of manufacturing associated with deferred revenue on gralise and proquin xr product shipments are recorded as deferred costs  which are included in inventory  until such time the deferred revenue is recognized 
research and development expense our research and development expenses currently include salaries  clinical trial costs  consultant fees  supplies  manufacturing costs for research and development programs and allocations of corporate costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses cannot be predicted at this time for our product candidates in research and development  as it is not possible to determine the nature  timing and extent of clinical trials and studies  the fda s requirements for a particular drug and the requirements and level of participation  if any  by potential partners 
as potential products proceed through the development process  each step is typically more extensive  and therefore more expensive  than the previous step 
success in development therefore  generally results in increasing expenditures until actual product approval

we generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings 
these studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product 
we then submit the results of these studies to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which  if successful  allows the opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process in phase  we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug s early safety profile and its blood concentration profile over time 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase  we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and further evidence of 
table of contents safety 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase  we conduct large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety  as required by the fda 
a phase trial for our average potential product may take to years to plan and complete 
the most significant expenses associated with clinical development derive from phase trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
the fda may also require additional clinical trials after approval  which are known as phase trials 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and record keeping for each product 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulation  require the expenditure of substantial resources

total selling  general and administrative expenses  as compared to the prior year  were as follows in thousands selling  general and administrative expense promotion fee expense other selling  general and administrative expense total selling  general and administrative expense dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year the increase in other selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to increased sales and marketing costs related to the launch of gralise including launch marketing activities and costs associated with our contract sales organization 
in march  we received back from abbott the rights to market gralise and commenced pre launch commercial activities to support the launch of gralise

the ventiv sales representatives were hired and commenced training in september  and began promotion to physicians in october as such  reflected only a partial year of costs associated with our contract sales organization 
the decrease in promotion fee expense in as compared to was driven by a full year of glumetza promotion fees for as compared to eight months in  as a result of the santarus commercialization agreement entered into in august as a result of the santarus commercialization agreement entered into in august  we will no longer have promotion fee expense to santarus going forward

gain on settlement with abbott products in march  we entered into a settlement agreement with abbott products which provided for i the immediate termination of the parties license agreement  ii the transition of gralise back to us  and iii a million payment from abbott to us made in march the million payment was recognized as a gain within operating income in the first quarter of interest income and expense interest and other income interest expense net interest income expense interest and other income decreased in as compared to due to a receipt of approximately million in two grants from the us government under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project of the patient protection and affordable care act of for our serada for menopausal hot flashes and dm for parkinson s disease programs in  offset by higher interest income due to higher investment balances in interest and other income decreased in compared to due to lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on investments 
this decrease was partially offset by the receipt of approximately million in two grants from the us government under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project of the patient protection and affordable care act of interest expense relates to interest on the credit facility we entered into in june with general electric capital corporation and oxford finance corporation

we may incur operating losses in future years 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least the end of we base this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
our cash needs may also vary materially from our current expectations because of numerous factors  including sales of our marketed products  expenditures related to our commercialization of gralise  including our contractual obligations to ventiv and other arrangements we make for the commercialization of gralise  acquisitions or investment in complementary businesses  products or technologies

our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as we may be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
we currently do not have any other committed sources of capital 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities or from development and licensing arrangements to continue our development programs 
we may be unable to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders equity positions 
if adequate funds are not available we may have to significantly curtail commercialization of our marketed products or other operations obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms  and or delay  postpone or terminate clinical trials  the inability to raise any additional capital required to fund our operations could have a material adverse effect on our company
