item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
capital we are required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve board and our bank subsidiary must comply with similar capital adequacy standards established by the fdic 
as a financial holding company  we and our bank subsidiary are required to maintain capital levels required for a well capitalized institution  as defined in prompt corrective action below 
our capital requirements the federal reserve board adopted guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company or financial holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the bank holding company act 
these guidelines include quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off balance sheet items and that define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements 
all bank holding companies are required to maintain tier capital of at least percent of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items  total capital the sum of tier capital and tier capital of at least percent of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items and tier capital of at least percent of adjusted quarterly average assets 
tier capital consists principally of shareholders equity less any amounts of goodwill  other intangible assets  non financial equity investments  and other items that are required to be deducted by the federal reserve board 
tier capital consists principally of perpetual and trust preferred stock that is not eligible to be included as tier capital  term subordinated debt  intermediate term preferred stock and  subject to limitations  general allowances for loan and lease losses 
assets are adjusted under the risk based guidelines to take into account different risk characteristics 
average assets for this purpose do not include goodwill and any other intangible assets and investments that the federal reserve board determines should be deducted from tier capital 
this regulatory capital framework is expected to change in important respects as a result of the dodd frank act and a separate  international regulatory capital initiative known as basel iii 
in particular  the dodd frank act eliminates tier capital treatment for most trust preferred securities after a three year phase in period that begins january  furthermore  the current risk based capital guidelines that apply to synovus and its subsidiary bank are based upon the capital accord of the bcbs  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors 
the basel i standards to which us banks and bank and financial holding companies are subject were implemented by the federal reserve 
in  the federal reserve began to phase in capital standards based on the bcbs second capital accord  referred to as basel ii  for large or core international banks total assets of billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of billion or more 
basel ii emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  as well as supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements 
in december  bcbs finalized new regulatory capital standards  known as basel iii 
these standards  which are aimed at capital reform  seek to further strengthen financial institutions capital positions by mandating a higher minimum level of common equity to be held  along with a capital conservation buffer to withstand future periods of stress 
the basel iii regime does not supplant basel ii  however 
the basel ii requirements focus on the appropriate allocation of capital to bank assets based on credit risk 
basel iii addresses the quality of capital and introduces new capital requirements but does not purport to overrule the credit risk based standards of basel ii 
in addition  reflecting the importance that regulators place on managing capital and other risks  on june   the banking agencies also issued proposed guidance on stress testing for banking organizations with more than billion in total consolidated assets  this proposed guidance outlines four high level principles for stress testing practices that should be a part of a banking organization s stress testing framework 
specifically  the guidance calls for the framework to i include activities and exercises that are tailored to the activities of the organization  ii employ multiple conceptually sound activities and approaches  iii be forward looking and flexible  and iv be clear  actionable  well supported  and used in the decision making process 
moreover  the federal bank regulators have issued a series of guidance and rulemakings applicable to large banks 
while many of these do not currently apply us due to our asset size  these issuances could impact industry capital standards and practices in many  potentially unforeseeable ways 
as of december   our tier common equity is in excess of the minimum common equity and additional conservation 
table of contents buffer stipulated by these newly proposed requirements 
regardless  complying with these new capital requirements will likely affect our operations  and the extent to which we will be affected will be known with more certainty once additional clarity is provided on the underlying details of these new requirements 
these new requirements have been endorsed by the us banking regulators  but have not yet been translated by the regulators into official regulation for us financial institutions 
it is anticipated that the regulators will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the bcbs  and the new requirements are anticipated to be phased in for us financial institutions beginning in it is widely anticipated that the capital requirements for most bank and financial holding companies  as well as for most insured depository institutions  will increase  although the nature and amounts of the increase have not yet been specified 
see part i item a 
risk factors if economic conditions worsen or regulatory capital rules are modified  we may be required to undertake additional strategic initiatives to improve our capital position 
synovus bank s capital requirements to be well capitalized  synovus bank must generally maintain a total capital the sum of tier capital and tier capital ratio of percent or greater  a tier capital ratio of percent or greater  and a leverage ratio of percent or greater 
for the purposes of these tests  tier capital consists of common equity  retained earnings and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock  less goodwill and certain core deposit intangibles 
tier capital consists of non qualifying preferred stock  certain types of debt and the eligible portion of the allowance for loan losses 
in measuring the adequacy of capital  assets are weighted for risk at rates that generally range from zero percent to percent 
certain assets  such as most cash instruments and us treasury securities  have a zero risk weighting 
others  such as certain commercial and consumer loans  have a percent risk weighting 
risk weightings are also assigned for off balance sheet items such as unfunded loan commitments 
the various items are multiplied by the appropriate risk weighting to determine risk adjusted assets for the capital calculations 
for the leverage ratio mentioned above  assets are not risk weighted 
capital ratios certain regulatory capital ratios for synovus and synovus bank as of december  are shown in the following table 
table capital ratios as of december  regulatory minimums regulatory minimums to be well capitalized synovus synovus bank tier capital ratio total risk based capital ratio leverage ratio synovus bank is a party to a memorandum of understanding with the fdic and the ga dbf and has agreed to maintain minimum capital ratios at specified levels higher than those otherwise required by applicable regulation as follows tier capital to total average assets leverage ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets total risk based capital ratio

prompt corrective action for undercapitalization the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions 
under this system  the federal banking regulators are required to rate insured depository institutions on the basis of five capital categories as described below 
the federal banking regulators are also required to take mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions  with respect to insured depository institutions in the three undercapitalized categories  the severity of which will depend upon the capital category in which the insured depository institution is assigned 
generally  subject to a narrow exception  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured depository institution that is critically undercapitalized 
the federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category 
under the regulations  all insured depository institutions are assigned to one of the following capital categories 
table of contents well capitalized the insured depository institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure 
a well capitalized insured depository institution is one having a total risk based capital ratio of percent or greater  having a tier risk based capital ratio of percent or greater  having a leverage capital ratio of percent or greater  and that is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
adequately capitalized the insured depository institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure 
an adequately capitalized insured depository institution is one having a total risk based capital ratio of percent or greater  having a tier risk based capital ratio of percent or greater  and having a leverage capital ratio of percent or greater  or a leverage capital ratio of percent or greater if the institution is rated composite under the camels capital  assets  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market risk rating system  and failing to meet the definition of a well capitalized bank 
undercapitalized the insured depository institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
an undercapitalized insured depository institution is one having a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  having a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or a leverage capital ratio of less than percent  or if the institution is rated a composite under the camels rating system  a leverage capital ratio of less than percent 
significantly undercapitalized the insured depository institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
a significantly undercapitalized insured depository institution is one having a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or a leverage capital ratio of less than percent 
critically undercapitalized the insured depository institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency 
a critically undercapitalized institution is one having a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than percent 
the regulations permit the appropriate federal banking regulator to downgrade an institution to the next lower category if the regulator determines after notice and opportunity for hearing or response that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has received and not corrected a less than satisfactory rating for any of the categories of asset quality  management  earnings or liquidity in its most recent examination 
supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator depend upon an institution s classification within the five categories 
our management believes that we and our bank subsidiary have the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized institutions under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act regulations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this report 
if an institution fails to remain well capitalized  it will be subject to a variety of enforcement remedies that increase as the capital condition worsens 
for instance  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution  including payment of a dividend  or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized as a result 
see dividends 
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system 
in addition  undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the fdic  are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval 
a depository institution s holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan  up to an amount equal to the lesser of percent of the depository institution s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 
deposit insurance and assessments deposits at our bank are insured by the dif as administered by the fdic  up to the applicable limits established by law 
the dodd frank act amended the statutory regime governing the dif 
among other things  the dodd frank act established a minimum designated reserve ratio drr of percent of estimated insured deposits  required that the fund reserve ratio reach percent by september  and directed the fdic to amend its regulations to redefine the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments 
specifically  the dodd frank act requires the assessment base to be an amount equal to the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution during the assessment period  minus the sum of the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period and an amount the fdic determines is necessary to 
table of contents establish assessments consistent with the risk based assessment system found in the federal deposit insurance act 
in december of  the fdic adopted a final rule setting the drr at percent 
furthermore  on february   the fdic issued a final rule changing its assessment system from one based on domestic deposits to one based on the average consolidated total assets of a bank minus its average tangible equity during each quarter 
the february  final rule modifies two adjustments added to the risk based pricing system in an unsecured debt adjustment and a brokered deposit adjustment  discontinues a third adjustment added in the secured liability adjustment  and adds an adjustment for long term debt held by an insured depository institution where the debt is issued by another insured depository institution 
under the february  final rule  the total base assessment rates will vary depending on the dif reserve ratio 
for example  for banks in the best risk category  the total base assessment rates will be between and basis points when the dif reserve ratio is below percent  between and basis points when the dif reserve ratio is between percent and percent  between and basis points when the dif reserve ratio is between percent and percent and between and basis points when the dif reserve ratio is percent or higher 
in addition  the fdic collects fico deposit assessments  which is calculated off of the new assessment base established by the dodd frank act 
fico assessments are set quarterly  and in ranged from annual basis points in the first quarter to 
annual basis points in the second  third and fourth quarters 
synovus bank pays the deposit insurance assessment  less offset available by means of prepaid assessment credits  and pays the quarterly fico assessments 
the dodd frank act provides temporary  unlimited deposit insurance for all noninterest bearing transaction accounts 
in january  the fdic issued final rules implementing this provision of the dodd frank act by including iolta accounts within the definition of a noninterest bearing transaction account 
per the fdic s final rules  all funds held in iolta accounts  together with all other noninterest bearing transaction account deposits  are fully insured  without limit  from december   through december  see part i item a 
risk factors regulation of the financial services industry continues to undergo major changes  and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position 
on november   the fdic imposed a requirement on all financial institutions to prepay three years of fdic insurance premiums 
on december   synovus prepaid million of fdic insurance premiums for the next three years 
on december   synovus prepaid fdic insurance premiums totaled approximately million 
with respect to brokered deposits  an insured depository institution must be well capitalized in order to accept  renew or roll over such deposits without fdic clearance 
an adequately capitalized insured depository institution must obtain a waiver from the fdic in order to accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits 
undercapitalized insured depository institutions generally may not accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits 
see the deposits section of part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
dodd frank act  future changes to legal framework on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act  which will substantially change the regulatory framework under which we operate over the next several years 
the dodd frank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry  addressing  among other things  systemic risk  capital adequacy  deposit insurance assessments  consumer financial protection  interchange fees  derivatives  lending limits  mortgage lending practices  registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies 
among the provisions that may affect the operations of synovus or synovus bank are the following creation of the cfpb with centralized authority  including examination and enforcement authority  for consumer protection in the banking industry 
new limitations on federal preemption 
new prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in  or relationships with  a hedge fund or private equity fund 
application of new regulatory capital requirements  including changes to leverage and risk based capital standards and changes to the components of permissible tiered capital 
requirement that the company and its subsidiary bank be well capitalized and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies 
changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums 
permanently raising the fdic s standard maximum insurance amount to  and  through december   providing unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts 
repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits  effective july   thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 

table of contents restrictions on compensation  including a prohibition on incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk by taking covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive  or that may lead to material losses 
requirement that sponsors of asset backed securities retain a percentage of the credit risk underlying the securities 
requirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating creditworthiness 
some of these and other major changes  such as the planned expiration of the unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts at december   could materially impact the profitability of our business  the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans  require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs  taxes  liabilities  enforcement actions and reputational risk 
many of these provisions became effective upon enactment of the dodd frank act  while others are subject to further study  rule making  and the discretion of regulatory bodies 
in light of these significant changes and the discretion afforded to federal regulators  we cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the dodd frank act or any implementing regulations will have on synovus businesses or its ability to pursue future business opportunities 
additional regulations resulting from the dodd frank act may materially adversely affect synovus business  financial condition or results of operations 
see part item a 
risk factors regulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes  and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position of this report 
additional changes to the laws and regulations applicable to us are frequently proposed at both the federal and state levels 
the likelihood  timing  and scope of any such change and the impact any such change may have on us are impossible to determine with any certainty 
consumer protection regulations retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers 
interest and other charges collected or contracted for by banks are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates 
loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions  such as the federal truth in lending act and regulation z issued by the federal reserve board  governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers  the home mortgage disclosure act and regulation c issued by the federal reserve board  requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves  the equal credit opportunity act and regulation b issued by the federal reserve board  prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race  creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit  the fair credit reporting act and regulation v issued by the federal reserve board  governing the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies  the fair debt collection act  governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies  and the guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws 
deposit operations also are subject to the truth in savings act and regulation dd issued by the federal reserve board  which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers  regulation cc issued by the federal reserve board  which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers  the right to financial privacy act  which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records  and the electronic funds transfer act and regulation e issued by the federal reserve board  which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services 
in addition  there are a number of significant consumer protection standards that apply to functional areas of operation rather than applying only to loan or deposit products 
for example  in june  the federal reserve issued a final rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions 
the federal reserve and fdic also recently enacted consumer protection regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions 
the fdic has also issued rules aimed at protecting consumer in connection with retail foreign exchange transactions 
in addition  the federal reserve has been actively revising regulation e  which governs electronic transactions  including a recent proposal governing remittance transfer transactions 
among the finalized changes made to regulation e  is the 
table of contents november amendment  which prohibits financial institutions  including synovus bank  from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one time debit card transactions  unless a consumer consents  or opts in  to the overdraft service for those types of transactions 
regulation e amendments also require financial institutions to provide consumers with a notice that explains the financial institution s overdraft services  including the fees associated with the service and the consumer s choices 
the amendments to regulation e became effective on august  in november  the fdic supplemented the regulation e amendments by requiring fdic supervised institutions  including synovus bank  to implement additional changes relating to automated overdraft payment programs by july  the most significant of these changes require financial institutions to monitor overdraft payment programs for excessive or chronic customer use and undertake meaningful and effective follow up action with customers that overdraw their accounts more than six times during a rolling month period 
the additional guidance also imposes daily limits on overdraft charges  requires institutions to review and modify check clearing procedures  prominently distinguish account balances from available overdraft coverage amounts and requires increased board and management oversight regarding overdraft payment programs 
many of the foregoing laws and regulations are subject to change resulting from the provisions in the dodd frank act  which in many cases calls for revisions to implementing regulations 
in addition  oversight responsibilities of these and other consumer protection laws and regulations transferred from the bank s primary regulator to the cfpb 
the cfpb is in the process of republishing the transferred regulations in a new section of the code of federal regulations but has not yet made substantive changes to these rules 
it is anticipated that the cfpb will be making substantive changes to a number of consumer protection regulations and associated disclosures in the near term 
we cannot predict the effect that being regulated by a new  additional regulatory authority focused on consumer financial protection  or any new implementing regulations or revisions to existing regulations that may result from the establishment of this new authority  will have on synovus businesses 
additional regulations resulting from the dodd frank act may materially adversely affect synovus business  financial condition or results of operations 
see part item a 
risk factors regulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes  and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position of this report 
in addition  synovus bank may also be subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers 
anti money laundering  usa patriot act  office of foreign assets control financial institutions must maintain anti money laundering programs that include established internal policies  procedures  and controls  a designated compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and testing of the program by an independent audit function 
we are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers 
we also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions 
recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 
anti money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the usa patriot act  enacted in and renewed in bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications 
the usa patriot act amended  in part  the bank secrecy act and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering 
the statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the us government  including requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering  requiring reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the treasury s financial crimes enforcement network for transactions exceeding  and mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating us laws and regulations 
the statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer  maintain  or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non us persons 
the federal bureau of investigation may send bank regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities 
our banks can be requested to search their records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists and may be required to report any identified relationships or transactions 
furthermore  the office of foreign assets control  or ofac  is responsible for helping to ensure that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties  as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress 
ofac publishes  and routinely updates  lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding  harboring or engaging in terrorist acts  including the specially designated nationals and blocked persons 
if we find a name on any transaction  account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list  we must freeze such account  file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities 
commitments to synovus bank 
table of contents under the federal reserve board s policy  we are expected to serve as a source of financial strength to synovus bank and to commit resources to support synovus bank in circumstances when we might not do so absent such policy 
under the bank holding company act  the federal reserve board may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary  other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank  upon the federal reserve board s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any depository institution subsidiary 
further  the federal reserve board has discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non bank subsidiaries if the agency determines that any such divestiture may aid the depository institution s financial condition 
in addition  any capital loans by us to synovus bank would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the bank 
notably  the dodd frank act codified the federal reserve s source of strength doctrine  this statutory change became effective july  in addition to the foregoing requirements  the dodd frank act s new provisions authorize the federal reserve to require a company that directly or indirectly controls a bank to submit reports that are designed both to assess the ability of such company to comply with its source of strength obligations and to enforce the company s compliance with these obligations 
as of the date of this report  the federal reserve and other federal banking regulators have not yet issued rules implementing this requirement  which are scheduled to be issued by july  if we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the dodd frank act  any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of synovus bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the fdic  as appropriate  and entitled to a priority of payment 
in addition  the fdic provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of  or any assistance provided by the fdic to  a commonly controlled insured depository institution 
synovus bank is an fdic insured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements 
transactions with affiliates and insiders a variety of legal limitations restrict our subsidiary bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds or in some cases transacting business with us or our non bank subsidiaries 
synovus bank is subject to sections a and b of the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulation w 
section a places limits on the amount of covered transactions  which include loans or extensions of credit to  investments in or certain other transactions with  affiliates as well as the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates 
the aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to percent of the bank s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and percent for all affiliates 
furthermore  within the foregoing limitations as to amount  certain covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from to percent 
also  the bank is prohibited from purchasing low quality assets from any of its affiliates 
section of the dodd frank act broadens the definition of covered transactions to include derivative transactions and the borrowing or lending of securities if the transaction will cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate 
the revised definition also includes the acceptance of debt obligations of an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to a third party 
furthermore  reverse repurchase transactions will be viewed as extensions of credit instead of asset purchases and thus become subject to collateral requirements 
these expanded definitions take effect on july  section b  among other things  prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
except for limitations on low quality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound  regulation w generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates 
transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits 
the federal reserve board also may designate bank subsidiaries as affiliates 
banks are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders  and their related interests 
in general  such extensions of credit may not exceed certain dollar limitations  must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
certain extensions of credit also require the approval of a bank s board of directors 
regulatory examinations federal and state banking agencies require us and our subsidiary bank to prepare annual reports on financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures 
synovus bank  and in some cases we and our nonbank affiliates  must undergo regular on site examinations by the appropriate regulatory agency  which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities 
a bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution 
the results of the examination are confidential 
the cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined institution as the agency deems necessary or appropriate 
community reinvestment act 
table of contents the community reinvestment act requires the fdic to evaluate the record of synovus bank in meeting the credit needs of its local community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
these evaluations are considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions  and applications to open a branch or facility 
failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations on the bank 
commercial real estate lending lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators 
the regulators have advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations 
such loans generally include land development  construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property  and nonfarm  nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property 
the guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny total reported loans for construction  land development and other land represent percent or more of the institutions total capital  or total commercial real estate loans represent percent or more of the institution s total capital  and the outstanding balance of the institution s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by percent or more during the prior months 
in october  the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance on commercial real estate lending that emphasizes these considerations 
in addition  the dodd frank act contains provisions that may impact our business by reducing the amount of our commercial real estate lending and increasing the cost of borrowing  including rules relating to risk retention of securitized assets 
section of the dodd frank act requires  among other things  a loan originator or a securitizer of asset backed securities to retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets 
the banking agencies have jointly issued a proposed rule to implement these requirements but have yet to issue final rules 
branching the dodd frank act substantially amended the legal framework that had previously governed interstate branching activities 
formerly  under the reigle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  a bank s ability to branch into a particular state was largely dependent upon whether the state opted in to de novo interstate branching 
many states did not opt in  which resulted in branching restrictions in those states 
the dodd frank act removed the opt in concept and permits banks to engage in de novo branching outside of their home states  provided that the laws of the target state permit banks chartered in that state to branch within that state 
accordingly  de novo interstate branching by synovus bank is subject to these new standards 
all branching in which synovus bank may engage remains subject to regulatory approval and adherence to applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
anti tying restrictions in general  a bank may not extend credit  lease  sell property  or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for them on the condition that the customer obtain or provide some additional credit  property  or services from or to the bank or bank holding company or their subsidiaries  or the customer not obtain some other credit  property  or services from a competitor  except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended 
a bank may  however  offer combined balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products 
also  certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule 
privacy and credit reporting financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential customer information 
customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties  with some exceptions  such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer 
financial institutions generally may not disclose certain consumer or account information to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing  direct mail marketing or other marketing 
federal and state banking agencies have prescribed standards for maintaining the security and confidentiality of consumer information  and we are subject to such standards  as well as certain federal and state laws or standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach 
synovus bank utilizes credit bureau data in underwriting activities 
use of such data is regulated under the fair credit reporting act and regulation v on a uniform  nationwide basis  including credit reporting  prescreening  and sharing of information between affiliates and the use of credit data 
the fair and accurate credit transactions act  which amended the fair credit reporting act  permits states to enact identity theft laws that are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of that act 

table of contents enforcement powers synovus bank and its institution affiliated parties  including management  employees  agents  independent contractors and consultants  such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the institution s affairs  are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law  regulations or written orders of a government agency 
violations can include failure to timely file required reports  filing false or misleading information or submitting inaccurate reports 
civil penalties may be as high as  a day for such violations and criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes may include imprisonment for years 
regulators have flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution affiliated parties  and the fdic has the authority to terminate deposit insurance 
when issued by a banking agency  cease and desist and similar orders may  among other things  require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice  including restitution  reimbursement  indemnifications or guarantees against loss 
a financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth  dispose of certain assets  rescind agreements or contracts  or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency 
the federal banking agencies also may remove a director or officer from an insured depository institution or bar them from the industry if a violation is willful or reckless 
we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of atlanta and the georgia commissioner  pursuant to which we agreed to implement plans that are intended to  among other things  minimize credit losses and reduce the amount of our distressed assets  limit and manage our concentrations in commercial real estate loans  improve our credit risk management and related policies and procedures  address liquidity management and current and future capital requirements  strengthen enterprise risk management practices  and provide for succession planning for key corporate and regional management positions 
additionally  synovus bank is presently subject to a memorandum of understanding with the georgia commissioner and the fdic that is substantially similar in substance and scope to the holding company memorandum of understanding described above and  as a result of recent compliance exams  synovus bank has entered into an informal written agreement with the fdic relating to certain compliance matters

monetary policy and economic controls the earnings of synovus bank  and therefore our earnings  are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities  including the monetary policy of the federal reserve board 
an important function of the federal reserve board is to promote orderly economic growth by influencing interest rates and the supply of money and credit 
among the methods that have been used to achieve this objective are open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate for bank borrowings  expanded access to funds for nonbanks and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans  investments and deposits  interest rates on loans and securities  and rates paid for deposits 
recently  in response to the financial crisis  the federal reserve board has created several innovative programs to stabilize certain financial institutions and to ensure the availability of credit 
the effects of the various federal reserve board policies on our future business and earnings cannot be predicted 
we cannot predict the nature or extent of any effects that possible future governmental controls or legislation might have on our business and earnings 
depositor preference statute federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution are afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against such institution  including federal funds and letters of credit  in the liquidation or other resolution of the institution by any receiver 
tarp regulations eesa and arra under the eesa  congress has the ability to impose after the fact terms and conditions on participants in the cpp 
as a participant in the cpp  we are subject to any such retroactive legislation 
on february   the treasury announced the financial stability plan under the eesa the financial stability plan which is intended to further stabilize financial institutions and stimulate lending across a broad range of economic sectors 
on february   president obama signed the arra  a broad economic stimulus package that included additional restrictions on  and potential additional regulation of  financial institutions 
on june   under the authority granted to it under arra and eesa  the treasury issued an interim final rule under section of eesa  as amended by arra  regarding compensation and corporate governance restrictions that would be imposed 
table of contents on tarp recipients  effective june  as a tarp recipient with currently outstanding tarp obligations  we are subject to the compensation and corporate governance restrictions and requirements set forth in the interim final rule  which  among other things prohibit us from paying or accruing bonuses  retention awards or incentive compensation  except for certain long term stock awards  to our senior executives and next most highly compensated employees  prohibit us from making severance payments to any of our senior executive officers or next five most highly compensated employees  require us to conduct semi annual risk assessments to assure that our compensation arrangements do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks or the manipulation of earnings to increase compensation  require us to recoup or clawback any bonus  retention award or incentive compensation paid by us to a senior executive officer or any of our next most highly compensated employees  if the payment was based on financial statements or other performance criteria that are later found to be materially inaccurate  prohibit us from providing tax gross ups to any of our senior executive officers or next most highly compensated employees  require us to provide enhanced disclosure of perquisites  and the use and role of compensation consultants  required us to adopt a corporate policy on luxury and excessive expenditures  require our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide period certifications about our compensation practices and compliance with the interim final rule  require us to provide enhanced disclosure of the relationship between our compensation plans and the risk posed by those plans  and require us to provide an annual non binding shareholder vote  or say on pay proposal  to approve the compensation of our executives  consistent with regulations promulgated by the sec 
on january   the sec adopted final regulations setting forth the parameters for such say on pay proposals for public company tarp participants 
notably  the dodd frank act contains separate requirements relating to compensation arrangement 
specifically  the act requires banking regulators to issue regulations or guidelines to prohibit incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing excessive compensation or that may lead to material loss at certain financial institutions with billion or more in assets 
a proposed rule was published in the federal register on april   however  regulators have yet to issue final rules on the topic 
additional regulations applicable to tarp recipients adopted as part of eesa  the financial stability plan  arra  or other legislation may subject us to additional regulatory requirements 
the impact of these additional requirements may put us at competitive disadvantage in comparison to financial institutions that have either repaid all tarp funds or never accepted tarp funds and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
capital purchase program on october  the us treasury  or treasury  announced that  pursuant to the emergency economic stabilization act  it was implementing a voluntary program known as the capital purchase program  or cpp  pursuant to which eligible financial institutions could raise capital by selling preferred stock directly to the us government 
the purpose of the capital purchase program was to encourage us financial institutions to build capital to  among other things  increase the flow of financing to us businesses and consumers and support the us economy  and was also intended to prevent additional failures of financial institutions 
synovus applied for the maximum investment available under the cpp equal to of risk weighted assets  noting that this additional capital would be used to provide strength against worse than expected economic conditions  more flexibility in disposing of distressed assets to strengthen our balance sheet  capacity to invest in our local economies through lending  ability to work with homeowners in mortgage workouts  and participation in government directed acquisitions of banks or assets  and  as permitted  opportunistic acquisition transactions 
our application to participate in the cpp was approved by treasury on november  on december   synovus consummated the cpp investment and issued to treasury  shares of synovus series a preferred stock having a liquidation amount per share equal to  for a total price of  the series a preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of per year 
synovus has timely paid all dividends on the series a preferred stock 
we may  at our option and with the consent of the fdic  redeem  in whole or in part  the series a preferred stock at the liquidation amount per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the series a preferred stock is generally non voting 
however  if we fail to pay dividends on the series a preferred stock for an aggregate of six quarterly periods  whether or not consecutive  our number of authorized directors shall be increased by two and the holders of the series a preferred stock shall have the right to elect two directors 
in addition  the consent of the holders of of the series a preferred stock is required to authorize or create any stock ranking senior to the series a preferred stock  for any amendment to our certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the rights or preferences of the holders of the series a preferred stock and for consummation of certain business combinations 
as part of its purchase of the series a preferred stock  we also issued the treasury a warrant the warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an initial per share exercise price of 
the warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions  such as upon stock splits or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of our common stock  and upon certain issuances of our common stock at or below a specified price relative to the initial exercise price 
the warrant expires on december  on january   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to register the resale by treasury of the series a preferred stock  the warrant and the shares of common stock underlying the warrant 
in addition  if the shelf 
table of contents registration statement is unavailable and we are requested by treasury to do so  we may be obligated to file a registration statement covering an underwritten offering of these securities 
a consequence of the series a preferred stock purchase includes certain restrictions on executive compensation that could limit the tax deductibility of compensation we pay to executive management 
see supervision  regulation and other factors tarp regulations for a more detailed description of the compensation and corporate governance restrictions that are applicable to us and other cpp participants

item a 
risk factors this section highlights the material risks that we currently face 
please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future 
new risks may emerge at any time  and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or the trading price of our securities 
the current and further deterioration in the residential construction and commercial development real estate markets may lead to increased non performing assets in our loan portfolio and increased provision for loan losses for losses on loans  which could have a material adverse effect on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
since the third quarter of  the residential construction and commercial development real estate markets have experienced a variety of difficulties and challenging economic conditions 
our non performing assets were billion at december   compared to billion at december  and billion at december  while recent economic data suggests that overall economic conditions are improving  if market conditions remain poor or further deteriorate  they may lead to additional valuation adjustments on our loan portfolios and real estate owned as we continue to reassess the fair value of our non performing assets  the loss severities of loans in default  and the fair value of real estate owned 
we also may realize additional losses in connection with our disposition of distressed assets 
poor economic conditions could result in decreased demand for residential housing  which  in turn  could adversely affect the development and construction efforts of 
table of contents residential real estate developers 
consequently  such economic downturns could adversely affect the ability of such residential real estate developer borrowers to repay these loans and the value of property used as collateral for such loans 
a sustained weak economy could also result in higher levels of non performing loans in other categories  such as commercial and industrial loans  which may result in additional losses 
management continually monitors market conditions and economic factors throughout our footprint for indications of change in other markets 
if these economic conditions and market factors negatively and or disproportionately affect some of our larger loans  then we could see a sharp increase in our total net charge offs and also be required to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses 
any further increase in our non performing assets and related increases in our provision for loan losses for losses on loans could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses  and we may be required to materially increase our allowance  which may adversely affect our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses  which represents management s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans  as described under note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report and under critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans  risk ratings  and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
because the risk rating of the loans is inherently subjective and subject to changes in the borrower s credit risk profile  evolving local market conditions and other factors  it can be difficult for us to predict the effects that those factors will have on the classifications assigned to the loan portfolio  and thus difficult to anticipate the velocity or volume of the migration of loans through the classification process and effect on the level of the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  we monitor our credit quality and our reserve requirements and use that as a basis for capital planning and other purposes 
see liquidity and capital resources under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
an increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income and capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
in light of current market conditions  we regularly reassess the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans at december   compared to million  or of total loans at december  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic assumptions as well as changes in assumptions regarding a borrower s ability to pay and or collateral values 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination procedures  periodically review the allowance 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  such agencies may require synovus to recognize additions to the allowance 
we recorded a provision for loan losses during the year ended december  of million compared to a billion provision for loan losses for the year ended december   both of which are significantly higher than historical levels 
we also charged off approximately million in loans  net of recoveries  during the year ended december   compared to billion in loans  net of recoveries  during the year ended december   both of which were also significantly higher than in previous periods 
even though our credit trends showed improvement during compared to the prior two years  we expect that our levels of non performing assets will remain at elevated levels in the foreseeable future as the deterioration in the credit and real estate markets causes borrowers to default 
further  the value of the collateral underlying a given loan  and the realizable value of such collateral in a foreclosure sale  likely will be negatively affected by the downturn in the real estate market  and therefore may result in an inability to realize a full recovery in the event that a borrower defaults on a loan 
in addition  as we execute our previously announced strategy to dispose of distressed assets  we will realize additional future losses if the proceeds we receive upon disposition of assets are less than the recorded carrying value of such assets 
any additional non performing assets  loan charge offs  increases in the provision for loan losses or any inability by us to realize the full value of underlying collateral in the event of a loan default  could negatively affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations and the price of our securities 

table of contents we will realize additional future losses if our levels of non performing assets do not moderate and if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of assets are less than the carrying value of such assets 
in  we announced a strategy to aggressively dispose of non performing assets 
during  we completed sales of approximately million of distressed assets  and we sold approximately billion of distressed assets in each of and we presently expect to continue our sales of distressed assets during the actual volume of future distressed asset sales could increase based on regulatory directives  the level of migration of performing loans to problem loan status  as well as opportunities to sell such assets  thus resulting in higher credit costs 
conversely  the continuing weakness in the residential and commercial real estate markets may negatively impact our ability to dispose of distressed assets  and may result in higher credit losses on sales of distressed assets 
non performing assets are recorded on our financial statements at the estimated fair value  which considers management s plans for disposition 
we will realize additional future losses if the proceeds we receive upon dispositions of assets are less than the recorded carrying value of such assets 
if market conditions continue to decline  the magnitude of losses we may realize upon the disposition of non performing assets may increase  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize the expected benefits from our strategic plan and our efficiency and growth initiatives 
in the second half of synovus announced an update of its three year strategic plan to address the challenges facing synovus and define strategies for expense reduction  streamlining of processes and long term growth initiatives 
the plan s key strategic elements are focused on the following areas enhancing the sales and service approach for targeted customer segments  aligning the cost structure with the current size of the organization  and enhancing the customer experience by streamlining processes 
the plan s stated goals include significant declines in non performing assets and potential problem loan levels  a further reduction in cre loan concentration  and substantial growth in the c i loan portfolio 
the goals also include substantial cost reductions and capital ratios that exceed regulatory requirements and position synovus favorably among its peers 
in january  synovus identified and announced a series of efficiency and growth initiatives implementing the updated strategic plan  including the following efficiency initiatives expected to generate an estimated million in annual expense savings by the end of  enhancements to synovus large corporate banking initiative  and streamlining of processes and enhanced product offerings and technology to improve the customer experience and reduce operating inefficiencies 
in  through execution of these initiatives  synovus realized a million  or  reduction in total non interest expense  and a million or reduction in core non interest expense 
however  the estimates and assumptions in the strategic plan and the related operating plan and restructuring of synovus cost base may or may not prove to be accurate in some respects  and there can be no assurance that synovus will ultimately realize the full benefits of the strategic plan or be able to sustain the annual cost savings anticipated by the plan 
in addition  synovus is subject to various risks inherent in its business 
these risks may cause the anticipated results from our strategic plan and cost reduction initiatives to result in implementation charges beyond those currently contemplated or could result in some other unanticipated adverse impact 
furthermore  the implementation of these initiatives may have unintended impacts on synovus ability to attract and retain business and customers  while revenue enhancement ideas may not be successful in the marketplace or may result in unintended costs 
accordingly  we cannot guarantee that the anticipated long term benefits from our strategic plan and cost reduction initiatives will be realized  and we may be unable to execute our business strategy and achieve our strategic and financial objectives 
if economic conditions worsen or regulatory capital rules are modified  we may be required to undertake additional strategic initiatives to improve our capital position 
during and  synovus executed a number of strategic capital initiatives to bolster our capital position against credit deterioration and to provide additional capital as synovus pursued its aggressive asset disposition strategy 
as of december   synovus tier capital ratio was  its tier common equity ratio was  and synovus and synovus bank were considered well capitalized under current regulatory standards 
see part i item business  supervision  regulation and other factors prompt corrective action of this report for a discussion of the definition of well capitalized 
this regulatory capital framework is expected to change in important respects as a result of the dodd frank act and a separate  international regulatory capital initiative known as basel iii 
in particular  the dodd frank act eliminates tier capital treatment for most trust preferred securities after a three year phase in period that begins january  furthermore  in december  bcbs finalized new regulatory capital standards  known as basel iii  which are aimed at capital reform  seek to further strengthen financial institutions capital positions by mandating a higher minimum level of common equity to be held  along with a capital 
table of contents conservation buffer to withstand future periods of stress 
at present  our tier common equity is in excess of the minimum common equity and additional conservation buffer stipulated by these newly proposed requirements 
regardless  complying with these new capital requirements will likely affect our operations  and the extent to which we will be affected will be known with more certainty once additional clarity is provided on the underlying details of these new requirements 
these new requirements have been endorsed by the us banking regulators  but have not yet been translated by the regulators into official regulation for us financial institutions 
it is anticipated that the regulators will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the bcbs and the new requirements are anticipated to be phased in for us financial institutions beginning in it is widely anticipated that the new capital requirements brought about by the implementation of the dodd frank act and basel iii for most bank and financial holding companies  as well as for most insured depository institutions  will increase  although the nature and amounts of the increase have not yet been specified 
in addition  reflecting the importance that regulators place on managing capital and other risks  on june   the banking agencies issued proposed guidance on stress testing for banking organizations with more than billion in total consolidated assets  this proposed guidance outlines four high level principles for stress testing practices that should be a part of a banking organization s stress testing framework 
specifically  the guidance calls for the framework to include activities and exercises that are tailored to the activities of the organization  employ multiple conceptually sound activities and approaches  be forward looking and flexible  and be clear  actionable  well supported  and used in the decision making process 
moreover  the federal bank regulators have issued a series of guidance and rulemakings applicable to large banks 
while many of these do not currently apply us due to our asset size  these issuances could impact industry capital standards and practices in many  potentially unforeseeable ways 
synovus continues to actively monitor economic conditions  evolving industry capital standards  and changes in regulatory standards and requirements  and engages in regular discussions with its regulators regarding capital at both synovus and synovus bank 
as part of its ongoing management of capital  synovus will continue to identify  consider  and pursue additional strategic initiatives to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary  including strategies in connection with any future repayment of synovus obligations under the cpp 
if economic conditions or other factors worsen to a materially greater degree than the assumptions underlying management s current internal assessment of our capital position or if minimum regulatory capital requirements for us or synovus bank increase as the result of legislative changes or informal or formal regulatory directives  then we would be required to pursue one or more additional capital improvement strategies  including  among others  balance sheet optimization strategies  asset sales  and or the sale of securities to one or more third parties 
given the current economic and market conditions and our financial performance and related credit ratings  there can be no assurance that any such transactions will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  or that we would be able to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions 
we also cannot predict the effect that these transactions would have on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  if we issue additional equity securities in these transactions  including options  warrants  preferred stock or convertible securities  such newly issued securities could cause significant dilution to the holders of our common stock 
further adverse changes in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 
during the past three years  our long term debt has been downgraded to below investment grade by moody s investors service  standard and poor s ratings services and fitch ratings 
the ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and synovus bank  and their ratings of our long term debt are based on a number of factors  including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control  including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 
in light of the continuing difficulties in the financial services industry and the housing and financial markets  there can be no assurance that we will not receive additional adverse changes in our ratings  which could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and the way in which we are perceived in the capital markets 
actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings  including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade  could affect the market value and liquidity of our outstanding public indebtedness and increase our borrowing costs 
we cannot predict whether existing customer relationships or opportunities for future relationships could be further affected by customers who choose to do business with a higher rated institution 
we may be unable to access historical and alternative sources of liquidity  which could adversely affect our overall liquidity 
liquidity represents the extent to which we have readily available sources of funding needed to meet the needs of our depositors  borrowers and creditors  to support asset growth  fund deposit withdrawals  to maintain reserve requirements  and to otherwise sustain our operations and the operations of our subsidiary bank 
for synovus bank  the primary source of liquidity is the growth and retention of deposits 
in the current competitive environment  customer confidence is a critical element in growing and retaining deposits 
in this regard  synovus bank s asset quality could play a larger role in the stability of the deposit base 
in the event asset quality declines significantly from its current level  synovus bank s ability to grow and retain deposits could be diminished 
we must maintain adequate liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs  including the servicing of debt  the payment of general corporate expenses  and the payment of dividends to shareholders 
in addition to our ordinary course liquidity needs  current conditions in the public markets for bank holding companies  dividend payments on our common stock 
table of contents and series a preferred stock  and capital needs of synovus bank during the financial crisis have put additional pressure on our liquidity 
the primary source of liquidity at the holding company level is dividends from synovus bank 
during  synovus did not receive any dividends from synovus bank 
synovus bank is currently subject to a memorandum of understanding that prohibits it from paying any cash dividends to us without regulatory approval  and other ga dbf rules and related statutes contain additional restrictions on payments of dividends by synovus bank 
see part i item business supervision  regulatory and other factors dividends 
synovus may not receive dividends from synovus bank in  which could adversely affect liquidity 
synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors  including  without limitation  synovus bank s future profits  asset quality and overall financial condition 
in addition to dividends from synovus bank  we have historically had access to a number of alternative sources of liquidity  including the capital markets  but there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
if our access to these traditional and alternative sources of liquidity is diminished or only available on unfavorable terms and we continue to experience increased demand for liquidity at the holding company level then our overall liquidity and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock 
although we have historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of our common stock  holders of our common stock are not legally entitled to receive dividends 
the reduction or elimination of dividends paid on our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the federal reserve could decide at any time that paying any common stock dividends could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
any of these decisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
for a discussion of current regulatory limits on our ability to pay dividends above per common share  see part i item business supervision  regulation and other factors dividends and risk factors we are presently subject to  and in the future may become subject to additional  supervisory actions and or enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on our business  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of our common stock and part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer repurchases of equity securities dividends in this report 
our net interest income could be negatively affected by the lower level of short term interest rates and a decrease in total loans 
net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on interest bearing liabilities  is a major component of our income 
our net interest income is our primary source of revenue from our operations 
the federal reserve reduced short term interest rates on three occasions in by a total of basis points  to  and by another basis points  to a range of to  during interest rates during  and have remained at the range of to as set by the federal reserve during a significant portion of our loans  including residential construction and development loans and other commercial loans  bear interest at variable rates 
in addition  in order to compete for deposits in our primary market areas  we may offer more attractive interest rates to depositors  or we may have to pursue other sources of liquidity  such as wholesale funds 
our total loans decreased to billion as of december  compared to billion as of december  a decrease in loans outstanding and lower realized yields on investment securities reduced our net interest income during the year ended december  and could cause additional pressure on net interest income in future periods 
this reduction in net interest income also may be exacerbated by the high level of competition that we face in our primary market area 
any significant reduction in our net interest income could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse impact on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market  or the way in which we are perceived in such markets  may adversely affect our capital resources  liquidity and financial results 
in managing our consolidated balance sheet  we depend on access to a variety of sources of funding to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs  and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our customers 
sources of funding available to us  and upon which we rely as regular components of our liquidity and funding management strategy  include borrowings from the fhlb and brokered deposits 
see liquidity and capital resources under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
we also have historically enjoyed a solid reputation in the capital markets and have been able to raise funds in the form of either short or long term borrowings or equity issuances 
if  due to market disruptions  perceptions about our credit ratings or other factors  we are unable to access the capital markets in the future  our capital resources and liquidity may be adversely affected 
in general  the amount  type and cost of our funding  including from other financial institutions  the capital markets and deposits  directly impacts our costs in operating our business and growing our assets and therefore  can positively or negatively affect our financial results 
a number of factors could make funding more difficult  more expensive or unavailable on any terms  including  but not limited to  further reductions in our debt ratings  financial results and losses  changes within our organization  
table of contents specific events that adversely impact our reputation  disruptions in the capital markets  specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry  counterparty availability  changes affecting our assets  the corporate and regulatory structure  interest rate fluctuations  general economic conditions and the legal  regulatory  accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions 
also  we compete for funding with other banks and similar companies  many of which are substantially larger  and have more capital and other resources than we do 
in addition  as some of these competitors consolidate with other financial institutions  these advantages may increase 
competition from these institutions may increase the cost of funds 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt 
as of december   synovus and its consolidated subsidiaries had billion of long term debt outstanding 
in february  we issued an additional million of long term debt and announced a tender offer for million of our existing subordinated notes due in our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to satisfy our obligations in respect of our debt  to refinance our debt or to fund capital expenditures will depend on our future operating performance 
prevailing economic conditions including interest rates  regulatory constraints  including  among other things  on distributions to us from our subsidiaries and required capital levels with respect to certain of our banking and insurance subsidiaries  and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  will also affect our ability to meet these needs 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or obtain future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt when needed on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
potential future losses will result in an additional valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
recapture of the deferred tax asset balance ie  reversal of the valuation allowance is subject to considerable judgment and could be adversely impacted by changes in future income tax rates 
during  synovus reached a three year cumulative pre tax loss position 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
under gaap  cumulative losses in recent years are considered significant negative evidence which is difficult to overcome in assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset 
as a result  beginning with the second quarter of  synovus no longer considers future taxable income in determining the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
synovus expects to reverse substantially all of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets once it has demonstrated a sustainable return to profitability 
however  the reversal of the valuation allowance is subject to considerable judgment 
additionally  even after the recovery of the deferred tax asset balance under gaap  which would immediately benefit gaap capital and the tangible common equity ratio  there will remain limitations on the ability to include the deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes 
see income tax expense under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition of this report 
the us administration is seeking to lower the current corporate income tax rate 
if the corporate income tax rate is lowered  it could adversely impact our ability to recover the deferred tax asset balance 
issuances or sales of common stock or other equity securities could result in an ownership change as defined for us federal income tax purposes 
in the event an ownership change were to occur  our ability to fully utilize a significant portion of our us federal and state tax net operating losses and certain built in losses that have not been recognized for tax purposes could be impaired as a result of the operation of section of the code 
our ability to use certain realized net operating losses and unrealized built in losses to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an ownership change as defined by section of the code 
an ownership change under section generally occurs when a change in the aggregate percentage ownership of the stock of the corporation held by five percent shareholders increases by more than fifty percentage points over a rolling three year period 
a corporation experiencing an ownership change generally is subject to an annual limitation on its utilization of pre change losses and certain post change recognized built in losses equal to the value of the stock of the corporation immediately before the ownership change  multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate subject to certain adjustments 
the annual limitation is increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year 
since us federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for up to years  the annual limitation also effectively provides a cap on the cumulative amount of pre change losses and certain post change recognized built in losses that may be utilized 
pre change losses and certain post change recognized built in losses in excess of the cap are effectively unable to be used to reduce future taxable income 
in some circumstances  issuances or sales of our stock including any common stock or other equity issuances or debt for equity exchanges and certain transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control could result in an ownership change under section in april  we adopted a shareholder rights plan  which provides an economic disincentive for any one person or group acting in concert to become an owner  for relevant tax purposes  of or more of our stock 
while adoption of the rights plan 
table of contents should reduce the likelihood that future transactions in our stock will result in an ownership change  there can be no assurance that the rights plan will be effective to deter a stockholder from increasing its ownership interests beyond the limits set by the rights plan or that an ownership change will not occur in the future 
furthermore  our ability to enter into future transactions may be impaired if such transactions result in an unanticipated ownership change under section if an ownership change under section were to occur  the value of our net operating losses and a portion of the net unrealized built in losses will be impaired 
because a valuation allowance currently exists for substantially the full amount of our deferred tax assets  no additional charge to earnings would result 
however  an ownership change  as defined above  could adversely impact our ability to recover the deferred tax asset in the future 
we presently are subject to  and in the future may become subject to  supervisory actions and enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on our business  reputation  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of our common stock 
under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions  state banking regulators  the federal reserve  and separately the fdic as the insurer of bank deposits  each has the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if any of them determine that we have insufficient capital or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices 
in addition to examinations for safety and soundness  synovus and its subsidiaries also are subject to continuous examination by state and federal banking regulators  including the newly formed cfpb  for compliance with various laws and regulations  as well as consumer compliance initiatives 
as a result of this regulatory oversight and examination process  our regulators can require us to enter into ga dbf informal or formal supervisory agreements  including board resolutions  memoranda of understanding  written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders  pursuant to which we could be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns  or to refrain from taking certain actions 
we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of atlanta and the ga dbf pursuant to which we agreed to implement plans that are intended to  among other things  minimize credit losses and reduce the amount of our distressed assets  limit and manage our concentrations in commercial real estate loans  improve our credit risk management and related policies and procedures  address liquidity management and current and future capital requirements  strengthen enterprise risk management practices  and provide for succession planning for key corporate and regional management positions and our board of directors 
the memorandum of understanding also requires that we inform and consult with the federal reserve board prior to declaring and paying any future dividends  and obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of atlanta and the ga dbf prior to increasing the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock above per share 
synovus bank is also presently subject to a memorandum of understanding with the ga dbf and the fdic that is substantially similar in substance and scope to the synovus memorandum of understanding described above 
the bank memorandum of understanding also requires that synovus bank obtain approval from the ga dbf and the fdic prior to paying any cash dividends to synovus and provides that  as a result of our charter consolidation  we will take all necessary steps to avoid customer confusion as a result of our proposed use of trade names at our various bank branches and to update our long term strategic plan to reflect the charter consolidation and the various actions we have otherwise agreed to implement under the memorandum of understanding 
in addition  as a result of recent compliance exams  synovus bank entered into an informal written agreement with the fdic relating to certain compliance matters 
under this agreement  synovus bank is required to implement written action plans  policies and procedures to address and remediate identified compliance concerns and furnish written quarterly progress reports to the fdic 
if we are unable to comply with the terms of our current supervisory agreements  or if we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives  supervisory agreements  or orders  then we could become subject to additional  heightened supervisory actions and orders  possibly including consent orders  prompt corrective action restrictions and or other regulatory actions  including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and series a preferred stock 
if our regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions  then we could  among other things  become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business  as well as restrictions on our existing business  and we could be required to raise additional capital  dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time  or both 
the terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business  reputation  operating flexibility  financial condition  and the value of our common stock 
see part i item business supervision  regulation  and other factors in this report 
recent legislative and regulatory initiatives applicable to financial institutions in general and tarp recipients in particular could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees and pursue business opportunities and could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors and damage our reputation if these competitors repay their tarp funds before us 
our success depends upon the ability to attract and retain highly motivated  well qualified personnel 
we face significant 
table of contents competition in the recruitment of qualified employees from financial institutions and others 
until we repay the tarp funds  we are subject to additional  and possibly changing  regulatory scrutiny and restrictions regarding the compensation of certain executives and associates as established under tarp guidelines 
the increased scrutiny and restrictions related to our compensation practices may adversely impact our ability to recruit  retain and motivate key employees  which in turn may impact our ability to pursue business opportunities and could otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 
see item business actions by federal and state regulators and supervision  regulation and other factors in this report 
in addition to the guidelines on incentive and senior officer compensation under tarp  the dodd frank act provides for the implementation of a variety of corporate governance and compensation practices applicable to all public companies  including synovus  which may impact certain of synovus executive officers and employees 
these provisions include  but are not limited to  requiring companies to claw back incentive compensation under certain circumstances  provide shareholders the opportunity to cast a non binding vote on executive compensation  to consider the independence of compensation advisors and new executive compensation disclosure requirements 
the dodd frank act also requires banking regulators to issue regulations or guidelines to prohibit incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing excessive compensation or that may lead to material loss at certain financial institutions with billion or more in assets 
such provisions with respect to compensation  in addition to other competitive pressures  may have an adverse effect on the ability of synovus to attract and retain skilled personnel 
further  in june  the federal reserve  the office of the comptroller of the currency  the office of thrift supervision  and the fdic jointly issued comprehensive final guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging employees to take imprudent risks 
this regulation significantly restricts the amount  form  and context in which we pay incentive compensation 
these restrictions may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have repaid all tarp funds before us  or who did not receive tarp funds  and with non financial institutions in terms of attracting and retaining senior level employees 
furthermore  to the extent that our competitors repay their tarp funds before us  our reputation and the public perception of our financial condition may be negatively affected  which could adversely affect our stock price 
regulation of the financial services industry continues to undergo major changes  and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position 
between and  many emergency government programs enacted in in response to the financial crisis and the recession slowed or wound down  and global regulatory and legislative focus has generally moved to a second phase of broader reform and a restructuring of financial institution regulation 
on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act  which has  and will continue to substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate 
the dodd frank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry  addressing  among other things  systemic risk  capital adequacy  deposit insurance assessments  consumer financial protection  interchange fees  derivatives  lending limits  mortgage lending practices  registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies 
among the provisions that may affect the operations of synovus bank or synovus are the following creation of the cfpb with centralized authority  including examination and enforcement authority  for consumer protection in the banking industry 
new limitations on federal preemption 
new prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in  or relationships with  a hedge fund or private equity fund 
application of new regulatory capital requirements  including changes to leverage and risk based capital standards and changes to the components of permissible tiered capital 
requirement that the company and its subsidiary bank be well capitalized and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies 
changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums 
permanently raising the fdic s standard maximum deposit insurance amount to  limit for federal deposit insurance and provide unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts through repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits  effective july   thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
restrictions on compensation  including a prohibition on incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive  or that may lead to material losses 

table of contents requirement that sponsors of asset backed securities retain a percentage of the credit risk of the assets underlying the securities 
requirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating credit worthiness 
some of these and other major changes could materially impact the profitability of our business  the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans  require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs  taxes  liabilities  enforcement actions and reputational risk 
for example  the provisions of the dodd frank act relating to debit card interchange fees have reduced our fee income 
we may not be able to fully replace the revenue lost by this limitation 
if the existing unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts is not extended past the current expiration date of december   we may see a run off in certain noninterest bearing demand deposits to the extent such deposits exceed the fdic s  per depositor maximum insurance coverage limit  which may adversely impact our liquidity 
many of these provisions became effective upon enactment of the dodd frank act  while others are subject to further study  rule making  and the discretion of regulatory bodies 
in light of these significant changes and the discretion afforded to federal regulators  we cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the dodd frank act or any implementing regulations will have on synovus businesses or its ability to pursue future business opportunities 
additional regulations resulting from the dodd frank act may materially adversely affect synovus business  financial condition or results of operations 
certain other reform proposals under consideration  including new proposed regulatory capital requirements proposed by the bcbs under basel iii  could result in synovus becoming subject to stricter capital requirements and leverage limits  and could also affect the scope  coverage  or calculation of capital  all of which could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital  including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors 
see part i item business supervision  regulation and other factors 
we cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and  if enacted  the effect that it  or any regulations  would have on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes  and we may be unable to effectively compete or may experience heightened cyber security risks as a result of these changes the financial services market  including banking services  is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and may enable us to reduce costs 
our future success may depend  in part  on our ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
as a result  our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired  and our business  financial condition or results of operations  may be adversely affected 
synovus is under continuous threat of loss due to cyber attacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business 
two of the most significant cyber attack risks that we face are e fraud and loss of sensitive customer data 
loss from e fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts 
the attempts to breach sensitive customer data  such as account numbers and social security numbers  are less frequent but could present significant reputational  legal and or regulatory costs to us if successful 
our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers  our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels  and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers 
we are subject to a variety of operational risks  including reputational risk  legal risk and regulatory and compliance risk  and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders  which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we are exposed to many types of operational risks  including reputational risk  legal and regulatory and compliance risk  the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders  including e fraud and cyber attacks and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors  including clerical or record keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems 
see part i item business enterprise risk management of this report 
negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including lending practices  corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities 
negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action 
actual or alleged conduct by synovus can result in negative public opinion about our other business 
negative public opinion could also affect our credit ratings  which are important to our access to unsecured wholesale borrowings 
our business involves storing and processing sensitive consumer and business customer data 
if personal  non public  confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused  we could suffer 
table of contents significant regulatory consequences  reputational damage and financial loss 
such mishandling or misuse could include  for example  if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information  either by fault of our systems  employees  or counterparties  or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties 
furthermore  a cybersecurity breach could result in theft of such data 
because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions  certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified 
our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect 
we also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages  or natural disasters  disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability 
we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are and to the risk that we or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate 
the occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business for example  by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect  as well as potential liability to clients  reputational damage and regulatory intervention  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations  perhaps materially 
our information systems may experience an interruption or security breach 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failure  interruption or security breach will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 
the costs and effects of litigation  investigations or similar matters involving us or other financial institutions or counterparties  or adverse facts and developments related thereto  could materially affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation  investigations  inquiries or similar matters arising out of our business  including those described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this report 
our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored  and any claims asserted against us  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  may harm our reputation 
should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising 
we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future  nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates  if at all 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with a variety of counterparties in the financial services industry 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or concerns about  one or more financial institutions with which we do business  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems in the past and could do so in the future and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be sold at prices that are sufficient for us to recover the full amount of our exposure 
any such losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are named in several class action lawsuits and several related suits and inquiries  and if we are unable to resolve these matters favorably  then our business  operating results and financial condition would suffer 
we are named in several class action lawsuits and several related suits and inquiries including a securities class action lawsuit alleging that misrepresentations or omissions in our securities filings artificially inflated our stock price in violation of the federal securities laws  two derivative lawsuits based upon substantially the same allegations as the securities class action lawsuit  and three separate class action lawsuits related to overdraft fees charged on debit cards 
see part i 
item legal proceedings and in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item in this report 
the plaintiffs in these lawsuits seek to recover damages in an unspecified amount and equitable and or injunctive relief 
synovus cannot predict the outcome of these or any other legal matters 
for those legal matters where synovus is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses 
synovus management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is from zero to million 
this estimated aggregate range is based upon information currently available to 
table of contents synovus  and the actual losses could prove to be higher or lower 
as there are further developments in these legal matters  synovus will continually reassess these matters and the estimated range of reasonably possible losses may change as a result of this assessment 
in addition  in the future  we may need to record litigation reserves with respect to these matters 
further  regardless of how these matters proceed  it could divert our management s attention and other resources away from our business 
our stock price has been and is likely to be volatile and the value of your investment may decline 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price 
the stock market in general  and the market for commercial banks and other financial services companies in particular  has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance  and the value of your investment may decline 
in addition  if the average closing price of our common stock is less than over a consecutive day trading period  we may become subject to delisting proceedings by the nyse 
we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties  borrower fraud  or certain borrower defaults  which could harm our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
synovus mortgage sells substantially all of the mortgage loans that it originates 
while the loans are sold without recourse  the purchase agreements require synovus mortgage to make certain representations and warranties regarding the existence and sufficiency of file documentation and the absence of fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers in connection with obtaining the loan 
if it is determined that loans sold were in breach of these representations or warranties  synovus mortgage has obligations to either repurchase the loan at the unpaid principal balance and related investor fees or make the purchaser whole for any economic losses associated with the loan 
in addition  the dodd frank act contains provisions designed to address perceived deficiencies in the residential mortgage loan origination and underwriting process  in part by creating new documentation requirements and underwriting criteria and increasing the potential liability of synovus and synovus mortgage to their customers if synovus and synovus mortgage fail to take steps to ensure and document that each borrower has the capacity and the ability to repay their loans 
to date  repurchase activity pursuant to the terms of these representations and warranties has been minimal and has primarily been associated with loans originated from through from january  through december  synovus mortgage originated and sold approximately billion of first lien gse eligible mortgage loans and approximately billion of first and second lien non gse eligible mortgage loans 
the total expense pertaining to losses from repurchases of mortgage loans previously sold  including amounts accrued in accordance with asc  was million  million  and thousand for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the total accrued liability related mortgage repurchase claims was million and million  at december  and  respectively 
we cannot assure you that 
in the current environment  synovus mortgage will not be required to repurchase substantially greater amounts of such mortgage loans  or make related indemnity payments to the purchasers of our mortgage loans 
if the level of repurchases or indemnity demands becomes significant or synovus mortgage is alleged to be in non compliance with the regulations under the dodd frank act  our results of operations may be adversely affected

in the current environment  regulatory restrictions may limit synovus ability to continue to pay dividends 
synovus must inform and consult with the federal reserve board prior to declaring and paying any future dividends on its common and preferred stock  and the federal reserve board could decide at any time that paying any dividends could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice

under the laws of the state of georgia  we  as a business corporation  may declare and pay dividends in cash or property unless the payment or declaration would be contrary to restrictions contained in our articles of incorporation  or unless  after payment of the dividend  we would not be able to pay our debts when they become due in the usual course of our business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities 
in addition  we are also subject to federal regulatory capital requirements that effectively limit the amount of cash dividends  if any that we may pay 
synovus ability to pay dividends is partially dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and non banking subsidiaries  which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities 
dividends from subsidiaries in   and were significantly lower than those received in previous years 
synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors  including  without limitation  synovus bank s future profits  asset quality and overall financial condition  and synovus may not receive dividends from synovus bank in see part i item business supervision  regulation and other factors dividends 
under the federal reserve board guidance reissued on february  the federal reserve may restrict our ability to pay dividends on any class of capital stock or any other tier capital instrument if we are not deemed to have a strong capital position 
in addition  we may have to reduce or eliminate dividends if our net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends previously paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  or our prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition  or we will not meet  or are in danger of not meeting the minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
on november   the federal reserve board issued further guidance noting  among other things  that bank holding companies should consult with the federal reserve before taking any actions that could result in a diminished capital bases  including increasing dividends 
as a result of the memorandum of understanding described in part i item a risk factors we are presently subject to  and in the future may become subject to additional  supervisory actions and or enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on our business  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of our common stock in this report  we are required to inform the federal reserve board in advance of declaring or paying any future dividends  and the federal reserve board could decide at any time that paying any common stock dividends could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
in the current financial and economic environment  the federal reserve board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has in some cases discouraged payment unless both asset quality and capital are very strong 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the synovus bank memorandum of understanding  synovus bank cannot pay any cash dividends without the approval of the fdic and the georgia commissioner

this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
economic overview the overall improvement of the us economy appears to have gained momentum during the fourth quarter of  building on moderate improvement in the third quarter of the initial stages of economic recovery emerged during the latter half of  but softened during the first and second quarters of in response to a series of global events  including the earthquake and tsunami in japan  geo political unrest in the middle east  the mid year elevation in energy costs  continued concerns over the debt of certain european nations  and the us congressional battle over raising the us debt ceiling 
the economic progress achieved in the latter half of is anchored in an improved job market and indications that the housing market may be stabilizing 
additionally  consumer spending and consumer confidence strengthened during the fourth quarter of certain european nations continue to wrestle with debt and budget deficit issues 
there is a concern of the potential impact on the global economies beyond europe if the european central bank and eurozone nations are unable to implement appropriate changes and solutions 
the ultimate outcome  however  cannot presently be determined 
furthermore  there can be no guarantee that the domestic economy will continue to improve 
the improvement in economic measures during has been positive in the aggregate  but progress during the year has been uneven at times with mixed messages in many economic measures 
inflation remains subdued  however  energy prices continue to show volatility 
the federal reserve s commitment to hold interest rates stable for the next two years appears to be an indication that it is more concerned with sustaining recovery than the risk of inflation 
long term interest rates have fallen significantly in response to the federal reserve bank s aggressive easing of monetary policy  with year treasury yields near and fixed mortgage interest rates falling to record lows below 
residential mortgage foreclosure and delinquency rates have declined over the past year  but remain at elevated levels compared to historical periods 
the census bureau reports new residential construction increased from  units in september to  units in december as compared to a december rate of  units 
in the south  residential units in december increased by from september and increased from a year ago 
mortgage rates continue to remain at record lows  due at least in part to federal reserve bank efforts to lower long term interest rates to stimulate the economy 
the supply of new homes decreased from months in december to months in december and the median sales price increased from  in to  in in the south  new homes sold decreased from approximately  in to approximately  in  and the median price increased from approximately  to approximately  sales of existing single family homes increased from million in to million in distressed sales foreclosures and short sales accounted for approximately of sales in december as compared to approximately in december the national median existing home price for all housing types was approximately  in december  which is below the december median 
existing housing inventory at the end of december dropped to million existing homes available 
table of contents for sale  representing a month supply at the current sales pace  down from a month supply in november existing housing inventory peaked at million in july  and december represents the lowest level since march when there were million homes on the market 
the bureau of economic analysis advance estimate released in january of indicates that real gdp increased at an annual rate of in the fourth quarter of  as compared to in the third quarter of  in the second quarter of  in the first quarter of  and in the fourth quarter of the national bureau of economic research nber determined that the most recent recession began in december and ended in june during  the economy returned to an expansionary phase marked by a relatively slow recovery  but the rate of expansion softened substantially during the first and second quarters of and strengthened during the third and fourth quarters of the southeastern us economy has continued to improve  but at a very moderate pace during the fourth quarter of as compared to the us economy as a whole 
the labor force in synovus five state footprint grew by approximately  jobs in as compared to an increase of approximately  during the unemployment rate in synovus five state southeastern footprint was in december  decreased to in march  remained near for most of the second and third quarters of  and decreased to in december the national unemployment rate  which was in december  fell to in march  but remained near during the second and third quarters of  and decreased to in december the unemployment rates within synovus footprint increased to elevated levels in recent years due to a combination of the collapse of the real estate market over recent years and the number of rural population centers which tend  on average  to experience generally higher rates of unemployment than the national average during all economic phases 
unemployment rates showed meaningful improvement during  particularly during the fourth quarter of the mortgage bankers association reported that the percentage of mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure to total mortgage loans was during the third quarter of  unchanged from the second quarter of  reflecting a decrease from in the first quarter of and an increase of four basis points from in the fourth quarter of during the third quarter of  the thirty day delinquency rate reached its lowest level since the second quarter of  a sign that new mortgage delinquencies have slowed 
the delinquency rate for one to four unit residential property mortgage loans decreased to of all loans outstanding as of the end of the third quarter of this was a decrease of basis points from the second quarter and a decrease of basis points from the third quarter of the institute of supply management s indices for manufacturing and non manufacturing increased during the fourth quarter of the manufacturing index was for december  up from in september  and the non manufacturing index was  up from in september institute of supply management indices above are an indication of economic expansion 
additionally  consumer confidence strengthened in the fourth quarter of the consumer confidence index was in december  as compared to for september and in june as a result of the economic downturn  consumer saving and debt reduction have increased steadily over the past four years while consumer spending has reflected restraint and uncertainty 
there are many components to a sustainable economic recovery  including improved consumer spending  a stable housing market  expansion of employment  and a low level of inflation 
stable energy costs and governmental support through sound monetary and fiscal policy are also key contributors 
on the whole  economic conditions are currently positive  but the recovery to pre downturn levels is expected to continue at a slower and more uneven pace than historical periods of recovery 
as the recession began to emerge in  residential mortgage foreclosures began to escalate and real estate values began to decline 
these factors expanded as the us economy reached a confirmed recessionary trend and significantly impacted the performance of synovus residential construction and real estate and land acquisition loan portfolios 
other segments of synovus commercial loan portfolio were impacted as well  particularly in industries that were adversely impacted by the changes in commercial real estate and residential development 
as a result  synovus experienced significant increases in its credit costs  elevated levels of loan charge offs  non performing asset inflows  significant losses on distressed asset dispositions  and further valuation adjustments on existing non performing assets 
synovus loan portfolio contracted during this period due to loan charge offs  distressed asset sales  and weak demand for new loans 
as the economy transitioned into recovery during the second half of  certain segments of the economy began to stabilize  yet the supply of low cost housing due to cumulative foreclosures and distressed sales continued to exceed demand 
while the housing market has lagged behind the general economic recovery to date as a whole  the decline in residential real estate prices has begun to stabilize in certain areas of the us though still at elevated levels as compared to historical periods  synovus rate of non performing asset inflows has declined  total credit costs have decreased  and loan charge offs have declined as the economy moved into a period of recovery 
bank failures reached elevated levels over the past few years  particularly in synovus southeastern market 
during  the national trend improved significantly as bank failures decreased approximately to however  almost half of the failures occurred in synovus five state footprint  with in georgia  in florida  three in south carolina and two in alabama 

table of contents the total number of failures in synovus five state footprint declined from in to in mortgage loan repurchase obligations and foreclosure practices since  financial institutions have experienced a dramatic increase in the number of mortgage loan repurchase demands they received  including from government sponsored entities  mortgage insurers  and other purchasers of residential mortgage backed securitizations  due to findings of mortgage fraud and underwriting deficiencies in the mortgage origination process  and misrepresentations in the packaging of mortgages by certain mortgage lenders 
also since  foreclosure practices of financial institutions nationwide have come under scrutiny due to the discovery of fraudulent documentation and questionable residential foreclosure procedures of certain financial institutions 
to date  synovus has experienced minimal repurchase activity in its consumer mortgage lending operations 
additionally  foreclosure activity in the home equity and consumer mortgage loan portfolios has been low 
see mortgage banking in this report for further discussion of synovus experience with residential mortgage repurchase obligations and foreclosure activity in its home equity and consumer mortgage loan portfolios 
overview of financial results for the year ended december   synovus reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million  or per common share  as compared to million  or per common share  for the year ended december  the improved results are primarily due to a million decline in credit costs provision for loan losses  losses on foreclosed real estate  and other credit costs which was partially offset by income from discontinued operations of million reported in the results include million in net investment securities gains while the results include a million pre tax gain from the sale of the merchant services business 
although credit costs  charge offs  and non performing asset levels remain elevated  most credit quality measures have continued to show improvement during total provision for loan losses in was million  a million or improvement from net charge offs declined million  from billion in to million in non performing assets declined from billion at december  to billion at december  the decline in provision for loan losses from is primarily due to continued improvement in credit quality trends during including reduced net charge offs  npl inflows  and special mention and accruing substandard loans as well as continued migration in the mix of the loan portfolio to reduced levels of higher credit risk loan types 
while the provision for loan losses and loan charge offs in declined from levels  these amounts continued to remain elevated when compared to historical levels 
the elevated level of the provision for loan losses and loan charge offs in was primarily driven by commercial credits  particularly in the commercial real estate segment 
the provision for loan losses attributable to the commercial real estate portfolio was million  or of the total expense for the year  while net charge offs attributable to this portfolio were million  or of the total net charge offs for the year 
the provision for loan losses attributable to the commercial and industrial portfolio was million  or of the total expense for the year  while charge offs attributable to this portfolio were million  or of total charge offs 
pre tax  pre credit costs income which excludes provision for loan losses  other credit costs  securities gains and losses  and certain other items was million for  down million from million for see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures in this report 
the decrease in pre tax  pre credit costs income was primarily due to lower net interest income resulting mainly from lower loan balances  as well as lower non interest income 
these items were partially offset by lower non interest expense 
the net interest margin increased basis points to for compared to for the improvement in the net interest margin was due to a basis point decrease in the effective cost of funds  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets 
total loans were billion at december   a decline from year end the decline in loan balances was driven by sales of distressed loans  charge offs  and transfers to ore 
additionally  loan paydowns exceeded new and existing loan fundings by approximately million 
positive momentum in the loan pipeline during the second half of  along with reductions in charge offs and loan sales  contributed to the stabilization of loan balances during the fourth quarter of total deposits decreased by billion since year end the decrease was driven by a billion decline in brokered deposit accounts  as synovus continued to reduce its dependence on funding from these products through planned reductions during  and a billion decline in non brokered time deposits 
these declines were offset in part by growth in non interest bearing demand deposit accounts of billion 
at december   brokered deposits represented of synovus total deposits compared to at december  
table of contents total shareholders equity decreased by million to billion at year end synovus continues to actively monitor its capital position as well as economic conditions  evolving industry capital standards  and changes in regulatory standards and requirements 
as part of its ongoing management of capital  synovus will continue to monitor its capital position and identify  consider  and pursue additional strategies to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary

table of contents critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus conform to gaap and to general practices within the banking and financial services industries 
synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature  synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates 
it is management s practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee  including the development  selection  and disclosure of the critical accounting policies 
the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus consolidated financial statements 
synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies 
allowance for loan losses notes and to synovus consolidated financial statements contain a discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million  compared to million at december  the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by synovus  including the credit risk committee for accuracy and consistency between the changes in the allowance for loan losses with the credit trends and credit events in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on an analysis which assesses the inherent risk for probable loss within the loan portfolio 
significant judgments and estimates are necessary in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
significant judgments include  among others  loan risk ratings and classifications  the determination and measurement of impaired loans  the timing of loan charge offs  the probability of loan defaults  the net loss exposure in event of loan defaults  qualitative loss factors  management s plans  if any  for disposition of certain loans as well as other qualitative considerations 
in determining an adequate allowance for loan losses  management makes numerous assumptions  estimates  and assessments which are inherently subjective 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on provisions for loan losses  allowance for loan losses  non performing loans  loan charge offs  and other credit metrics 
please refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for an expanded discussion of the company s methodologies  qualitative considerations  and key assumptions 
other real estate other real estate  consisting of properties obtained through a foreclosure proceeding or through an in substance foreclosure in satisfaction of loans  is reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell  determined on the basis of current appraisals  comparable sales  and other estimates of fair value obtained principally from independent sources  adjusted for estimated selling costs 
management also considers other factors or recent developments  such as changes in absorption rates or market conditions from the time of valuation and anticipated sales values considering management s plans for disposition  which could result in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals 
significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate  and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility 
in response to market conditions and other economic factors  management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its distressed asset disposition strategy 
as a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition  the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals  comparable sales  and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate 
management reviews the value of other real estate each quarter and adjusts the values as appropriate 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance asc provides accounting guidance for determining when a company is required to record a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset may not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the period and or of the character necessary to utilize the benefit of the deferred tax asset 
in making this assessment  all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset are considered  including taxable income in prior carry back years  future reversals of existing temporary differences  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards 
the predictability that future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  will occur is the most subjective of these four sources 
the presence of cumulative losses in recent years is considered significant negative evidence  making it difficult for a company to rely on future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards  as a reliable source of taxable income to realize a deferred tax asset 
judgment is a critical element in making this assessment 
changes in the valuation allowance that result from favorable changes in those circumstances that cause a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets in future years are recorded through income tax expense 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  synovus considered all available evidence about the realization of dtas  both positive and negative  that could be objectively verified 
synovus positive evidence considered in support of its use of 
table of contents forecasted future earnings as a source of realizing dtas was insufficient to overcome the negative evidence associated with its pre tax cumulative loss position 
the total valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets was million at december  reversal of the dta valuation allowance balance is subject to considerable judgment 
however  synovus expects to reverse substantially all or approximately million of the current balance of million of the dta valuation allowance once it has demonstrated a sustainable return to profitability and experienced consecutive profitable quarters coupled with a forecast of sufficient continuing profitability 
this reversal could occur as a single event or over a period of time depending upon the level of forecasted taxable income  the degree of probability related to realizing the forecasted taxable income  and the estimated risk related to credit quality 
in that event  there will remain limitations on the ability to include the deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes 
pursuant to regulatory requirements  as taxes paid in carryback periods are exhausted  financial institutions must deduct from tier i capital the greater of the amount by which net deferred tax assets exceed what they would expect to realize within one year or the amount by which the net deferred tax assets exceeds of tier i capital 
fair value measurements synovus reviews assets and liabilities that are either required or elected to be carried  reported  or disclosed at fair value  and determines the valuation of these instruments in accordance with fasb asc topic  fair value measurements 
we assess the fair value measurements of each instrument on a periodic basis  but no less than quarterly 
these fair value measurements consider the guidance in asc  which provides a three level framework for determining the appropriate fair value for a particular asset or liability 
these levels require consideration of information  such as observable market prices  reported trades  broker quotes  various modeling techniques  including  in some cases  unobservable inputs 
the company selects the most appropriate technique for determining the fair value of the asset or liability 
the various techniques described by asc require significant judgment  and results could vary materially  depending on the valuation method selected 
fair value is measured  either on a recurring basis  in which the fair value is the primary measure of accounting  or on a non recurring basis  to measure items for potential impairment  or for disclosure purposes 
assets and liabilities measured under level of the fair value hierarchy are typically those that represent having the the least degree of liquidity 
as of december   the company reported million or of total assets of assets classified under level of which million represented private equity investments 
as of december   the company reported million or of total liabilities of liabilities classified as level under asc see also note fair value accounting to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company s use of the various fair value methodologies  and the types of assets and liabilities in which fair value accounting is applied 
asset impairment long lived assets and other intangibles synovus reviews long lived assets  such as property and equipment and other intangibles subject to amortization  including core deposit premiums  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the actual cash flows are not consistent with synovus estimates  an impairment charge may result 
capital series a preferred stock on december   synovus issued to the treasury  shares of synovus series a preferred stock  having a liquidation amount per share equal to  for a total price of  the series a preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of per year 
synovus may  at its option  with the consent of the fdic  redeem  in whole or in part  the series a preferred stock at the liquidation amount per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the series a preferred stock is generally non voting 
however  if we fail to pay dividends on the series a preferred stock for an aggregate of six quarterly periods  whether or not consecutive  our number of authorized directors will be increased by two and the holders of the series a preferred stock shall have the right to elect two directors 
a consequence of the series a preferred stock purchase includes certain restrictions on executive compensation that could limit the tax deductibility of compensation that synovus pays to executive management 

table of contents as part of its purchase of the series a preferred stock  synovus issued the treasury a warrant to purchase up to  shares of synovus common stock warrant at an initial per share exercise price of 
the warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares of synovus common stock issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions  such as upon stock splits or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of synovus common stock  and upon certain issuances of synovus common stock at or below a specified price relative to the initial exercise price 
the warrant expires on december  pursuant to the securities purchase agreement  the treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrant 
the offer and sale of the series a preferred stock and the warrant were effected without registration under the securities act in reliance on the exemption from registration under section of the securities act 
synovus has allocated the total proceeds received from the united states department of the treasury based on the relative fair values of the series a preferred stock and the warrants 
this allocation resulted in the preferred shares and the warrants being initially recorded at amounts that are less than their respective fair values at the issuance date 
the million discount on the series a preferred stock is being accreted using a constant effective yield over the five year period preceding the perpetual dividend 
synovus records increases in the carrying amount of the preferred shares resulting from accretion of the discount by charges against accumulated deficit

the litigation escrow is funded by 
table of contents proceeds from visa s conversion of class b shares 
synovus carries a contingent liability representing the estimate of the company s exposure to the settlement of the covered litigation  via the visa derivative liability 
a relatively high degree of subjectivity is used in estimating the value of the derivative liability 
management believes that the estimate of visa s exposure to litigation liability is adequate based on current information  however  future developments in the litigation could require potentially significant changes to the estimate

average earning assets represented and of average total assets for and  respectively 
the reduction in average earning assets resulted primarily from a billion decrease in net loans  a million reduction in interest bearing funds held at the federal reserve bank  and a million reduction in mortgage loans held for sale 
these reductions in earning assets were partially offset by an increase of million in the investment securities portfolio 
the decrease in funding sources utilized to support earning assets was driven by decreases in deposits of billion  short term borrowings of million  and long term debt of million

net interest income net interest income interest income less interest expense is a significant component of revenue  representing earnings from the primary business of gathering funds from customer deposits and other sources  and investing those funds primarily in loans and investment securities 
synovus long term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest income while balancing interest rate  credit  liquidity  and capital risks 
net interest income is presented in this discussion on a tax equivalent basis so that the income from assets exempt from federal income taxes is adjusted based on a statutory marginal federal tax rate of in all years see table 
the net interest margin is defined as taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets and provides an indication of the efficiency of the earnings from balance sheet activities 
the net interest margin is affected by changes in the spread between interest earning asset yields and interest bearing liability costs spread rate  and by the percentage of interest earning assets funded by non interest bearing funding sources 
net interest income for was million  down million  or  from on a taxable equivalent basis  net interest income decreased million  or  from during  average earning assets decreased billion  or  primarily the result of a decrease in net loans 
net interest income for was million  down million  or  from on a taxable equivalent basis  net interest income decreased million  or  from during  average earning assets decreased billion  or  primarily the result of declines in net loans  offset in part by an increase in balances held with the federal reserve bank 
net interest margin the net interest margin was for  an increase of basis points from the yield on earning assets decreased basis points to and the effective cost of funds decreased basis points to 
the effective cost of funds includes non interest bearing funding sources primarily consisting of demand deposits 
the primary components of the yield on interest earning assets are loan yields  the yield on investment securities  and the yield on balances held with the federal reserve bank 
during  loan yields decreased basis points to 
the decrease 
table of contents in loan yields was due to a continued decline in market interest rates and the downward repricing of maturing fixed rate loans  partially offset by an improvement in the negative impact of non performing loans 
yields on investment securities decreased by basis points due to continued declines in bond market yields and the reinvestment of cash flows from older  higher yielding securities 
the yield on investment securities was also negatively impacted by a repositioning of the portfolio undertaken during the third quarter of a key component of this repositioning was the sale of higher coupon  more prepayment sensitive mbs  and the purchase of lower coupon mbs with less prepayment risk 
this action was deemed to be prudent in light of continued declines in rates and the expectation of a higher level of prepayment activity 
while increasing the stability of cash flows and expected yields on the portfolio  the short term impact of selling higher coupon mbs is negative to the overall portfolio yield 
the yield on balances held at the federal reserve bank remained unchanged at while the average balance decreased by million to billion in reducing these low yielding balances positively impacts realized earning asset yields 
synovus expects to further reduce the average balances held at the federal reserve bank during the primary factors contributing to the basis point decrease in the effective cost of funds during were a basis point decrease in the cost of time deposits and a basis point decrease in the cost of money market accounts 
in addition to these factors  reduced utilization of brokered deposits and a continued deposit mix shift toward lower cost transaction accounts favorably impacted the effective cost of funds 
average non interest bearing demand deposits  which increased by million  or  for  funded of average total interest earning assets in as compared to during the net interest margin was for  up basis points from the yield on earning assets decreased basis points while the effective cost of funds decreased by basis points 
during  loan yields increased basis points to with improvement due to a modest decline in the cost to carry non performing assets and an improvement in loan origination pricing 
average net loans decreased billion or to billion in yields on investment securities decreased by basis points primarily due to the continued historically low level of bond market yields and the reinvestment of cash flows from older higher yielding securities 
the yield on balances held at the federal reserve bank remained the same at in as in while the average balance held at the federal reserve bank increased by billion to billion in a significant portion of the increase in short term liquidity resulted from cash proceeds from the capital raised in may of this higher level of low yielding balances held at the federal reserve resulted in a reduction in realized earning asset yields 
the primary factors contributing to the basis point decrease in the effective cost of funds were a basis point decrease in the cost of time deposits and a basis point decrease in the cost of money market accounts 
additional factors that contributed to the decrease in the effective cost of funds in include growth in non interest bearing demand deposit accounts  reduced utilization of brokered time deposits  and a continued deposit mix shift toward lower cost transaction accounts

non interest income total non interest income was million in  up million or compared to the comparison is impacted by investment securities gains  net 
during the third quarter of  synovus implemented a repositioning of the investment securities portfolio 
the primary purpose of this repositioning was to reduce prepayment risk in the mbs portfolio and enhance capital by realizing market premiums on existing securities 
this activity resulted in net realized securities gains of million recognized during the following table shows the principal components of non interest income

goodwill at december   goodwill had a carrying value of million 
the goodwill is associated with two financial management services reporting units  million of the goodwill is attributable to a reporting unit that is a provider of investment advisory services 
we test goodwill for impairment annually  as of june  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit 
goodwill impairment exists when a reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis as events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is also applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 
the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment assessment and the application of these estimates and assumptions are discussed below 
the first step step of impairment testing requires a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to the carrying fair value to identify potential impairment 
at june   we completed the annual goodwill impairment evaluation 
the result of the step process indicated that goodwill at the investment advisory services reporting unit was not impaired  as the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the respective estimated carrying value  therefore no further testing was required 
the estimated fair value of this reporting unit using a weighted approach income and market approach evenly weighted was million  which exceeded the carrying value of million by million  or 
the key assumptions that drive the fair value of this reporting unit are projected revenue growth  projected ebitda margin  projected growth in assets under management  and the discount rate 
the projected revenue growth incorporates the new business that this reporting unit is expecting to add through its recent partnerships with national platforms  as well as a long term average of movement in aum related to equity and fixed income market returns 
additionally  the projected ebitda margin increases are based on the assumption that the current business platform is very scalable and future increases in aum revenue will require minimal incremental expenditures 
changes in the aforementioned assumptions  including a lower rate of revenue growth than expected and a lower than projected ebitda margin improvement  could have a negative effect on the fair value of this reporting unit  which in turn could result in an impairment charge to goodwill in future periods

synovus updates the fair value of the real estate collateral securing collateral dependent impaired loans each calendar quarter  with appraisals usually received on an annual basis  or sooner if appropriate  from an independent unaffiliated certified or licensed appraiser 
management also considers other factors or recent developments  such as selling costs and anticipated sales values considering management s plans for disposition  which could result in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals 
synovus updates the values of collateral that is in the form of accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  and cash surrender value of life insurance policies at least annually and the values of collateral that is in the form of marketable securities and brokerage accounts at least monthly 
it is the company s policy to obtain  on at least an annual basis  an updated appraisal from an independent  unaffiliated certified or licensed appraiser for loan relationships of million and over when at least one of the loans in the relationship is on non accrual status 
for relationships under million  while independent appraisals are not mandated by the company s policies  management will obtain such appraisals when considered prudent 
for credits that are not on impaired status  synovus generally obtains an unaffiliated third party appraisal of the value of the real estate collateral prior to each loan renewal 
additionally  if conditions warrant eg  loans that are not considered impaired but exhibit a higher or potentially higher risk  synovus engages an unaffiliated appraiser to reappraise the value of the collateral on a more frequent basis 
examples of circumstances that could warrant a new appraisal on an existing performing credit include instances where local market conditions where the real estate collateral is located have deteriorated  the collateral has experienced damage fire  wind damage  etc  the lease or sell out of the collateral has not met the original projections  and the net operating income of the collateral has declined 
in circumstances where the collateral is no longer considered sufficient  synovus seeks to obtain additional collateral 
examples of adjustments made quarterly to appraised values include broker s commission  unpaid real estate taxes  attorney s fees  other estimated costs to dispose of the property  known damage to the property  known declines in the net operating income of the property or rent rolls  as well as third party market data

in the second quarter of  the company began its asset disposition strategy  which centers around disposition of distressed assets  as a proactive measure in managing the loan portfolio 
subsequent to the implementation of the asset disposition strategy  synovus entered into the synovus mou 
the synovus mou was in alignment with the existing asset disposition strategy  including managing various asset quality and regulatory capital ratios 
the asset disposition strategy is still in place today

through the provision for loan losses  synovus maintains an allowance for losses on loans that management believes is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  as well as changes in assumptions regarding a borrower s ability to pay and or collateral values 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination procedures  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  such agencies may require synovus to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million or of total loans  compared to million or of total loans at december  the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million or compared to the prior year 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses from to  and the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as of december   compared to december   as noted above  are due to continued improvement in credit quality trends during  as well as improvement in credit quality indicators at year end  as compared to year end  including

specifically  synovus generally obtains unlimited guarantees from any entity eg  individual  corporation  or partnership that owns or controls percent or more of the borrowing entity 
limited guarantees on a pro rata basis are generally required for all percent or more owners 

table of contents synovus evaluates the financial ability of a guarantor through an evaluation of the guarantor s current financial statements  income tax returns for the two most recent years  as well as financial information regarding a guarantor s business or related interests 
in addition  synovus analyzes substantial assets owned by the guarantor to ensure that the guarantor has the necessary ownership or control over these assets 
for loans that are not considered impaired  the allowance for loan losses is determined based on the risk rating of each loan 
the risk rating incorporates a number of factors  including guarantors 
if a loan is rated doubtful  with certain limited exceptions  a guarantee is not considered in determining the amount to be charged off ie  the charge off equals the greater of the amount of the collateral exposure or of the loan balance  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
with the exception of certain loans whose amount is inconsequential  all impaired loans are collateral dependent 
the charge off on these loans is determined based upon the amount of the collateral exposure only 
with certain limited exceptions  synovus seeks performance under guarantees in the event of a borrower s default 
however  under the current economic environment  and based on the fact that a majority of synovus problem credits are commercial real estate credits  synovus success in recovering amounts due under guarantees has been limited 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses table shows a five year comparison of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based on certain loss factors which could differ from the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans coverage was at december  compared to at december  this ratio is impacted by collateral dependent impaired loans which have no allowance for loan losses as the estimated losses on these credits have been charged off 
therefore  a more meaningful allowance for loan losses coverage ratio is the allowance to non performing loans excluding collateral dependent impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for loan losses which was at december  compared to at december  this ratio declined as a result of an increase in non performing loans that carried a reserve  combined with the decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
commercial loans had an allocated allowance of million  a decrease of million  or  from the prior year 
commercial  financial  and agricultural loans had an allocated allowance of million or of loans in the respective category at december  compared to million  or  at december  over the past year  these loans have experienced an improvement in the level of losses over on loans that default 
the allocated allowance for owner occupied loans was million  or of loans in the respective category at december  compared to million  or at december  at december   the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses related to commercial real estate construction loans was million  down from million in as a percentage of commercial real estate construction loans  the allocated allowance in this category was at december  compared to the previous year end 
as a percentage of total land acquisition loans  the allowance for loan losses in this category was compared to approximately of total loans in the prior year 
commercial real estate mortgage loans had an allocated allowance of million or of loans in the respective category at december  compared to million or at december  the unallocated allowance is and of total loans at december  and  respectively 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses is considered necessary to provide for certain qualitative environmental and economic factors that affect the probable loss inherent in the company s total loan portfolio 
the qualitative factors included in the determination of the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses include the following economic conditions  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and loan review staff  changes in the loan origination and monitoring policies and procedures  changes in the volume and trend of impaired loans and past due loans  changes in concentrations and volume and nature of loan growth  risk of grading not keeping pace with the speed and depth of deterioration in economic conditions  particularly related to identifying special mention credits  estimated risk associated with the deterioration in the fair value of collateral supporting synovus loans  
table of contents and other external impacts as may be applicable 
qualitative factors could have a significant impact on the inherent risk of loss in the company s loan portfolio 
the unallocated allowance for loan losses at december  is million or of the total allowance for loan losses 
this represents a reduction of million from the unallocated allowance for loan losses at december  of million or of the allowance for loan losses at that date 
this decline is primarily due to reduced volatility in loan grading  as the pace and depth of the deterioration in economic conditions is no longer causing continuous and rapid declines in loan grades 
for example  accruing substandard loans  which increased from billion at december  to billion at december   declined to billion at december  additionally  special mention loans  declined from billion at december  to billion at december   a decline 
further positively impacting the unallocated allowance for loan losses at december  were general improvements in loan monitoring management and policies 
a substantial number of synovus loans are secured by real estate located in five southeastern states georgia  alabama  florida  south carolina  and tennessee 
accordingly  the ultimate collectability of a substantial part of synovus loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in market conditions in these areas 
based on current information and market conditions  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate

non performing assets and past due loans non performing assets consist of loans classified as nonaccrual loans as well as real estate acquired through foreclosure 
accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when reasonable doubt exists as to the full collection of interest or principal  or when they become contractually in default for days or more as to either interest or principal  unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection 
nonaccrual loans consist of those loans on which recognition of interest income has been discontinued 
nonaccrual loans are reduced by the direct application of interest and principal payments to loan principal  for accounting purposes only 
restructuring of past due loans loans past due days or more  which based on a determination of collectability are accruing interest  are classified as past due loans 
synovus historic and current policy prohibits making additional loans to a borrower  or any related interest of a borrower  who is on nonaccrual status except under certain workout plans and if such extension of credit aids with loss mitigation 
additionally  synovus historic and current policy discourages making additional loans to a borrower or any related interest of the borrower who has a loan that is past due in principal or interest more than days and remains on accruing status

potential problem loans are defined by management as certain performing loans with a well defined weakness 
table of contents where there is information about possible credit problems of borrowers which causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms of such loans 
potential problem commercial loans consist of substandard accruing loans but exclude loans days past due and still accruing interest and substandard accruing troubled debt restructurings  which are reported separately 
management s decision to include performing loans in the category of potential problem loans indicates that management has recognized a higher degree of risk associated with these loans 
in addition to accruing loans days past due and accruing restructured loans  synovus had million of potential problem commercial loans at december  compared to billion at december  management s current expectation of probable losses from potential problem loans is included in the allowance for loan losses  and management cannot predict at this time whether these potential problem loans ultimately will become non performing loans or result in losses 
the trend of potential problem commercial loans has been declining and is down  or billion from the peak in the third quarter of  and approximately million of the decline is a result of these loans now being reported as accruing troubled debt restructurings

all loan modifications are evaluated for troubled debt restructuring tdr classification 
in accordance with asu  a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring  a tdr is defined as a modification with a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties  and the company has granted a financial concession that it would not normally make 
all tdr s are considered to be impaired loans  and the amount of impairment  if any  is determined in accordance with asc  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
 asc  and no 
 asc concessions provided by the company in a tdr are primarily in the form of providing a below market interest rate given the borrower s credit risk  a period of time generally less than one year with a reduction of required principal and or interest payments eg  interest only for a period of time  or extension of the maturity of the loan generally for less than one year 
insignificant periods of reduction of principal and or interest payments  or one time deferrals of months or less  are generally not considered to be financial concessions 
further  it is generally the company s practice not to defer principal and or interest for more than months 
these types of concessions may be made during the term of a loan or upon the maturity of a loan  in which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty  as a loan renewal 

table of contents renewals of loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are evaluated for tdr designation by determining if concession s are being granted  including consideration of whether the renewed loan has an interest rate that is at market  given the credit risk related to the loan 
non accruing tdrs may generally be returned to accrual status if there has been a period of performance  usually at least a six month sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower 
consistent with regulatory guidance  a tdr will generally no longer be reported as a tdr after a period of performance and after the loan was reported as a tdr at a year end reporting date  and if at the time of the modification the interest rate was at market  considering the credit risk associated with the borrower 
in april  the fasb issued asu  a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring  which was effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after june  on july   synovus adopted the provisions of asu  and as required  applied the provisions of the asu to all modifications and renewals that have occurred since january  synovus often increases or maintains the interest rate upon renewal of a commercial loan  including renewals of loans involving borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
prior to the adoption of asu  the interest rate on such renewals were generally not considered by synovus to be concessionary and were not considered tdrs 
the market interest rate concept in asu states that if a borrower does not otherwise have access to funds at a market interest rates for debt with characteristics similar to those of the restructured debt  the restructuring would be considered to be at a below market rate  which indicates that the lender may have granted a concession 
this component of asu resulted in an increase of approximately million in loans identified as tdrs upon adoption of asu table shows accruing tdrs by loan type as of december  and at december  and  the allowance for loan losses allocated to these accruing restructured loans was million and million  respectively 
the increase in accruing restructured loans since the prior year is primarily related to the adoption of asu accruing restructured loans are not considered non performing because they are performing in accordance with the restructured terms

prior to the charter consolidation  a component of synovus deposit growth was through the offering of shared deposit products 
the charter consolidation resulted in the inability to offer the shared deposit products in the future 
customers holding shared cd balances retained these deposits on a fully insured basis until their maturity 
as these shared cds matured  overall balances in this product have declined 
as of december   remaining balances in shared deposit products were million  down from million at december  following the charter consolidation  management developed a strategic plan to diversify synovus funding sources and reduce reliance on volatile funding sources including brokered deposits and shared deposit products 
the strategic initiatives implemented by management have reduced synovus dependence on brokered deposits and shared deposit products primarily through allowing partial runoff of maturing brokered deposits  reducing utilization of brokered money market accounts  reduction of shared deposit balances as the program expires  and maintaining and enhancing local market core deposit base

alco monitors synovus economic  competitive  and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring  monitoring  and reporting on liquidity and funding risk  interest rate risk  and market risk and has the authority to create policies relative to these risks 
alco  operating under liquidity and funding policies approved by the board of directors  actively analyzes contractual and anticipated cash flows in order to properly manage synovus liquidity position 
contractual and anticipated cash flows are analyzed under normal and stressed conditions to determine forward looking liquidity needs and sources 
synovus analyzes liquidity needs under various scenarios of market conditions and corporate operating performance 
this analysis includes stress testing and measures expected sources and uses of funds under each scenario 
emphasis is placed on maintaining numerous sources of current and potential liquidity in order for the company to meet its obligations to depositors  borrowers  and creditors on a timely basis 
liquidity is generated through maturities and repayments of loans by customers  maturities and sales of investment securities  deposit growth  and access to sources of funds other than deposits 
management constantly monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to meet estimated customer deposit withdrawals and future loan requests 
liquidity is also enhanced by the acquisition of new deposits 
each of the banking divisions monitors deposit flows and evaluates alternate pricing structures in an effort to retain and grow deposits 
customer confidence is a critical element in growing and retaining deposits 
in this regard  synovus asset quality could play a larger role in the stability of the deposit base 
in the event asset quality declines significantly from its current level  the ability to grow and retain deposits could be diminished  which in turn could reduce deposits as a liquidity source 
at december   shared cd balances totaled million 
synovus continues to pursue retention of shared cd balances at maturity  however  there can be no assurance that a significant portion of these deposits will remain on deposit at synovus bank 
while the possibility of this deposit outflow is a potential liquidity risk  this risk has diminished as remaining shared deposit balances have declined 
retention of significant liquid assets  primarily in the form of interest bearing funds with the federal reserve  should enable synvous bank to mitigate liquidity risks related to any outflow of these deposits at their maturity 
as a result of the dodd frank act  effective as of december   unlimited fdic insurance coverage for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts was extended through december  this component of the dodd frank act served to extend unlimited insurance coverage which was initially established by the tagp 
under current law  insurance coverage for non interest bearing demand deposits will decline to a level of  per depositor after december  currently  synovus has a significant customer base which maintain non interest bearing demand deposit balances that would exceed the insurance threshold after if this unlimited insurance coverage is not extended 
synovus ability to retain these deposits would depend on numerous factors  including general economic conditions and the operating performance and credit quality of synovus 
as this represents a potential liquidity risk  synovus expects to maintain an above average level of liquidity sources to mitigate such risk and to continue to monitor this risk throughout see part i item a 
risk factors regulation of the financial services industry continues to undergo major changes  and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position 
synovus bank also generates liquidity through the national deposit markets

synovus parent company has historically enjoyed a solid reputation in the capital markets and has historically been able to raise funds in the form of either short or long term borrowings or equity issuances  including the public offerings completed in september  may  and february however  in light of the current regulatory environment  market conditions  and synovus financial performance and related credit ratings  there can be no assurance that synovus would be able to obtain additional new borrowings or issue additional equity on favorable terms  if at all 
synovus will continue to identify  consider  and pursue additional strategic initiatives to further strengthen its liquidity position as deemed necessary 
synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above  including existing liquid funds on hand  are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs through the near future 
however  if economic conditions or other factors worsen to a greater degree than the assumptions underlying synovus internal financial performance projections  regulatory capital requirements for synovus or synovus bank increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise  or synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels  then synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources

as a financial holding company  synovus and its subsidiary bank  synovus bank  are required to maintain capital levels required for a well capitalized institution as defined by federal banking regulations 
the capital measures used by the federal banking regulators include the total risk based capital ratio  tier risk based capital ratio  and the leverage ratio 
synovus bank is a state chartered bank under the regulations of the ga dbf 
under applicable regulations  synovus bank is well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier capital ratio of or greater  a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to any written agreement  order  capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive from a federal and or state banking regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
however  even if synovus bank satisfies all applicable quantitative criteria to be considered well capitalized  the regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital 
in june  synovus bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the fdic and the ga dbf agreeing to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of and a minimum total risk based capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 
management believes that  as of december   synovus and synovus bank meet all capital requirements to which they are subject 
synovus has experienced significant credit losses in recent years  primarily as a result of an extended period of economic downturn impacting all segments of the united states economy 
while the level of credit losses has declined significantly from the peak with most credit quality measures continuing to improve  current levels of credit losses and non performing assets are still elevated compared to historical levels 
the cumulative effect of these credit losses over recent years has negatively impacted synovus capital position 
as a result  synovus has completed a number of steps to strengthen its capital position as described below 
synovus continuously and actively manages capital including forecasting and stress testing for both expected and more adverse economic conditions and will pursue additional strategies designed to bolster its capital position when and as deemed 
table of contents necessary 
if credit losses and credit deterioration exceed management s current expectations  they could adversely impact synovus capital ratios 
during   and  synovus completed several public offerings and other capital actions which are described below 
in december  synovus issued  shares of series a preferred stock to the united states department of the treasury as part of the cpp  generating million of tier capital 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
during  synovus undertook several initiatives to bolster its capital including a public offering of  shares of common stock that generated net proceeds of approximately million  the exchange of million in aggregate principal amount of its subordinated notes due for million shares of synovus common stock  which resulted in an increase to tangible common equity of approximately million  and the sale of synovus remaining shares of visa class b common stock  which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in this report for further information regarding the common stock offering  note exchange  and sale of visa class b common stock 
during  synovus undertook additional initiatives to further boost its capital including the sale of its merchant services business which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million  a public offering of  shares of common stock  and  units of tmeds 
the common stock and tmeds offerings  which were completed on may   generated aggregate cash proceeds of million and million  respectively  and increased tier common equity by approximately billion 
a tmeds unit consists of a prepaid common stock purchase contract recorded as equity and a junior subordinated amortizing note recorded as debt 
as a result of the tmeds issuance  million was recorded to debt  an offsetting million was recorded to prepaid debt issuance costs  and million was recorded to additional paid in capital 
during and continuing into  synovus experienced both significant declines in the value of collateral underlying real estate loans and heightened credit losses  which resulted in record levels of non performing assets  charge offs  foreclosures  and losses on disposition of distressed assets 
while these levels continue to remain high  most credit quality measures are continuing to improve  however  it remains difficult to predict whether the recent improvements experienced will continue  or whether the effects of any further potential future negative developments in the credit  economic  and regulatory environments will adversely impact these improving trends 
management currently believes  based on current internal capital analyses and earnings projections  that synovus capital position is adequate to meet current regulatory minimum capital requirements 
however  synovus continues to actively monitor economic conditions  evolving industry capital standards  and changes in regulatory standards and requirements  and engages in regular discussions with its regulators regarding capital at both synovus and synovus bank 
as part of its ongoing management of capital  synovus will continue to identify  consider  and pursue additional strategic initiatives to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary  including strategies in connection with any future repayment of synovus obligations under the cpp

the income tax expense attributable to discontinued operations is reflected as a component of income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes in the consolidated financial statements of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed analysis of income taxes 
synovus reported a net deferred tax asset  before the valuation allowance  of million compared to million at december  of this amount  million was generated from temporary differences of which the majority relates to the provision for loan losses 
this component does not have a set expiration date as the temporary differences have not yet reduced taxable income 
the remaining net deferred tax asset balance  before valuation allowance  of million relates to tax net operating loss deductions and state income tax credits that must be carried forward 
the majority of these tax carryforwards have set expiration dates  typically or years  from the date they are originally generated 
synovus currently expects that approximately million of its net deferred tax assets will expire before they can be realized 
the majority of these deferred tax assets relate to state income tax credits that have various expiration dates through the tax year synovus expects to record minimal to no tax expense when reporting pre tax profits in the future because reductions to the dta valuation allowance will be recognized offsetting current tax expense 
reversal of the dta valuation allowance balance is subject to considerable judgment 
however  synovus expects to reverse substantially all or approximately million of the current balance of million of the dta valuation allowance once it has demonstrated a sustainable return to profitability  perhaps at the point it has significantly improved credit quality and experienced consecutive profitable quarters coupled with a forecast of sufficient continuing profitability 
this reversal could occur as a single event or over a period of time depending upon the level of forecasted taxable income  the degree of probability related to realizing the forecasted taxable income  and the estimated risk related to credit quality 
in that event  there will remain limitations on the ability to include the deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes 
pursuant to regulatory requirements  as taxes paid in carryback periods are exhausted  financial institutions must deduct from tier i capital the greater of the amount by which net deferred tax assets exceed what they would expect to realize within one year or the amount by which the net deferred tax assets exceeds of tier i capital 
the us administration is seeking to lower the current corporate income tax rate 
if the corporate income tax rate is lowered  it could adversely impact our ability to recover the deferred tax asset balance 
in april  the synovus board of directors approved a shareholder rights plan designed to preserve synovus substantial tax assets 
this plan was ratified by synovus shareholders in april this plan is similar to tax benefit preservation plans adopted by other public companies with significant tax attributes whose ability to realize such benefit may become restricted by an ownership change under irc section synovus tax attributes include net operating losses  tax credit carryforwards  reversing temporary differences as reflected in deferred tax assets  before valuation allowance and certain built in losses that it could utilize in certain circumstances to offset taxable income and reduce its federal income tax liability 
an ownership change  as defined under section of the irc and related internal revenue service pronouncements  substantially limits a company s ability to use its tax attributes 
in general  an ownership change would occur if synovus percent shareholders  as defined under section  collectively increase their ownership in synovus by more than percentage points over a rolling three year period 
the shareholder rights plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that synovus experiences such an ownership change by deterring acquisitions that would increase the holdings of existing percent shareholders or cause any person or group to become a percent shareholder 
percent shareholders generally do not include certain institutional holders  such as mutual fund companies  that hold synovus equity securities on behalf of several individual mutual funds where no single fund owns percent or more of synovus equity securities 
inflation a financial institution s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  therefore  inflation can have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and may create a need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
interest rate levels are also significantly influenced by changes in the rate of inflation although they do not necessarily change at the same time or magnitude as the inflation rate 
these changes could adversely impact synovus financial position and profitability 
synovus attempts to mitigate the effects of inflation and changing interest rates by managing its interest rate sensitivity position through its asset liability management practices and by periodically adjusting its pricing of services and banking products in an effort to take into consideration such costs 
see market risk and interest rate sensitivity herein 
deflation an extended period of deflation could negatively impact the banking industry and may be associated with lower growth and a general deterioration of the economy 
such a scenario could impair bank earnings and profitability in a variety of ways including  but not limited to  decreases in the value of collateral for loans  a diminished ability of borrowers to service their debts  increases 
table of contents in the value of certain bank liabilities  and lessened demand for loans 
while these effects cannot be fully accounted for  synovus attempts to mitigate such risks through prudent underwriting of loans and through the management of its interest rate sensitivity position 
parent company the parent company s assets  primarily its investment in subsidiaries  are funded  for the most part  by shareholders equity 
it also utilizes short term and long term debt 
the parent company is responsible for providing the necessary funds to strengthen the capital of its subsidiaries  acquire new businesses  fund internal growth  pay corporate operating expenses  and pay dividends to its shareholders 
these operations have historically been funded by dividends and fees received from subsidiaries  and borrowings from outside sources 
however  as a result of the challenging economic conditions  dividends from subsidiaries were significantly lower in   and than in previous years 
additionally  the parent company was required to provide higher levels of capital infusions to subsidiaries during and thus  synovus has taken a number of steps to strengthen its capital and liquidity positions as described below 
on december   the parent company received proceeds of million from the sale of preferred stock and warrants to the us treasury as part of the government s capital purchase program 
on september   the parent company received proceeds of million  net of issuance costs  from the public offering of  shares of synovus common stock at a price of per share 
on november   the parent company recognized a gain of million from the sale of its remaining shares of visa class b common stock 
additionally  during  the parent company received proceeds of million from the sale of certain private equity investments 
on november   synovus completed an exchange offer exchange offer of  in aggregate principle amount of its outstanding subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes exchanged in the exchange offer represent of the  aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding prior to the exchange offer 
pursuant to the terms of the the exchange offer  synovus issued million shares of synovus common stock as consideration for the notes 
the exchange offer resulted in a pre tax gain of million which was recorded as a component of other non interest income in during  the parent company undertook additional initiatives to increase its capital including a public offering of  shares of common stock  and  units of tmeds 
the common stock and tmeds offerings  which were completed on may   generated aggregate proceeds of billion  net of issuance costs 
on february   synovus issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due february  the senior notes in a public offering for aggregate proceeds of million  net of discount and debt issuance costs 
concurrent with this offering  synovus announced a cash tender offer tender offer for any and all of its outstanding subordinated notes due february  the notes  with a total principal amount outstanding of approximately million 
approximately million of the notes were tendered by the early tender deadline of february  the early tender deadline  and synovus paid total consideration of million for these notes 
holders of the notes who did not tender by the early tender deadline have until march  to tender their notes 
holders who tender their notes after february  but at or before march  will receive per  principal amount of the notes tendered

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents market risk and interest rate sensitivity market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
this risk of loss can be reflected in either diminished current market values or reduced current and potential net income 
synovus most significant market risk is interest rate risk 
this risk arises primarily from synovus core community banking activities of extending loans and accepting deposits 
managing interest rate risk is a primary goal of the asset liability management function 
synovus attempts to achieve consistency in net interest income while limiting volatility arising from changes in interest rates 
synovus seeks to accomplish this goal by balancing the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities along with the selective use of derivative instruments 
synovus manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by alco and approved by the board of directors 
alco meets periodically and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policies  reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of synovus  and developing and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet structure and interest rate risk positioning 
simulation modeling is the primary tool used by synovus to measure its interest rate sensitivity 
on at least a quarterly basis  the following twenty four month time period is simulated to determine a baseline net interest income forecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in interest rates 
the baseline forecast assumes an unchanged or flat interest rate environment 
these simulations include all of synovus earning assets  liabilities  and derivative instruments 
forecasted balance sheet changes  primarily reflecting loan and deposit growth expectations  are included in the periods modeled 
projected rates for new loans and deposits are based on management s outlook and local market conditions 
the magnitude and velocity of rate changes among the various asset and liability groups exhibit different characteristics for each possible interest rate scenario  additionally  customer loan and deposit preferences can vary in response to changing interest rates 
simulation modeling enables synovus to capture the expected effect of these differences 
synovus is also able to model expected changes in the shape of interest rate yield curves for each rate scenario 
simulation also enables synovus to capture the effect of expected prepayment level changes on selected assets and liabilities subject to prepayment 
synovus rate sensitivity position is indicated by selected results of net interest income simulations 
in these simulations  synovus has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in short term interest rates of and basis points to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next year 
due to short term interest rates being at or near at this time  only rising rate scenarios have been modeled 
as illustrated in table  the net interest income sensitivity model indicates that  compared with a net interest income forecast assuming stable rates  net interest income is projected to increase by and increase by if interest rates increased by and basis points  respectively 
these changes were within synovus policy limit of a maximum negative change 
the measured interest rate sensitivity indicates a moderately asset sensitive position over the next year  which could serve to improve net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
the actual realized change in net interest income would depend on several factors  some of which could serve to diminish or eliminate the asset sensitivity noted above 
market conditions and their resulting impact on loan  deposit  and wholesale funding pricing and volumes would be a primary risk to the projected interest rate sensitivity and a primary determinant in the realized level of net interest income 
these risks include  but are not limited to  higher than projected pressure on deposit pricing due to market competition or a greater than projected rate of customer migration to higher cost deposits  such as certificates of deposit 
synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines 
financial management services revenues  which include trust  brokerage  and financial planning fees  can be affected by risk in the securities markets  primarily the equity securities market 
a significant portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of asset values 
weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations 
trading account assets  maintained to facilitate brokerage customer activity  are also subject to market risk 
this risk is not considered significant  as trading activities are limited and subject to risk policy limits 
mortgage banking income is also subject to market risk 
mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore  mortgage banking income could be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates 
the extension of commitments to customers to fund mortgage loans also subjects synovus to market risk 
this risk is primarily created by the time period between making the commitment and closing and delivering the loan 
synovus seeks to minimize this exposure by utilizing various risk management tools  the primary of which are forward sales commitments and best efforts commitments 

table of contents table twelve month net interest income sensitivity change in short term interest rates in basis points estimated change in net interest income as of december  flat derivative instruments for interest rate risk management as part of its overall interest rate risk management activities  synovus utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of interest rate risks 
these instruments are in the form of interest rate swaps where synovus receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a floating rate tied to either the prime rate or libor 
these swaps are utilized to hedge the variability of cash flows or fair values of on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
interest rate derivative contracts utilized by synovus include end user hedges  all of which are designated as hedging specific assets or liabilities 
these hedges are executed and managed in coordination with the overall interest rate risk management function 
management believes that the utilization of these instruments can provide greater financial flexibility and efficiency in managing interest rate risk 
as of december   synovus had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts utilized to manage interest rate risk 
the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts utilized as part of overall interest rate risk management as of december  was million 
the notional amount represents the amount on which calculations of interest payments to be exchanged are based 
entering into interest rate derivatives contracts potentially exposes synovus to the risk of counterparties failure to fulfill their legal obligations including  but not limited to  potential amounts due or payable under each derivative contract 
this credit risk is normally a small percentage of the notional amount and fluctuates based on changes in interest rates 
synovus analyzes and approves credit risk for all potential derivative counterparties prior to execution of any derivative transaction 
synovus assesses the ongoing credit risk of its dealer counterparties by regularly monitoring publicly available credit rating information and other market indicators 
synovus seeks to limit credit risk by dealing with highly rated counterparties and by obtaining collateralization for exposures above certain predetermined limits 
a summary of these interest rate contracts and their terms at december  is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value net unrealized gains and losses of these contracts has been recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
during  a total of million in notional amounts of interest rate contracts matured 
a total notional amount of million of interest rate contracts matured in and million were terminated 
interest rate contracts contributed additional net interest income of million and a basis point increase in the net interest margin for for  interest rate contracts contributed additional net interest income of million and a basis point increase to the net interest margin 
although synovus has no outstanding interest rate swap contracts  amortization of previously terminated interest rate swap contracts is expected to add million to net interest income in
