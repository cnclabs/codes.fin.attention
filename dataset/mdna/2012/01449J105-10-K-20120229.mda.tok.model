during the period from the date of acquisition of diamics in july until its disposition in september  under the principles of consolidation  we consolidated of the operating results of the diamics operations in our consolidated statement of operations 
as a result of the disposition  we recorded a gain of million during the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense includes interest charges  and the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts associated with certain debt issuances 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was principally due to additional interest expense incurred on our subordinated notes  senior notes and subordinated notes  totaling million for  compared to million for other income expense  net

liquidity and capital resources based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans and expected business conditions  we currently expect to fund our short and long term working capital needs primarily using existing cash and our operating cash flow and we expect our working capital position to improve as we improve our future operating margins and grow our business through new product and service offerings and by continuing to leverage our strong intellectual property position 
as of december   we have million of cash  of which million was held by domestic subsidiaries and million was held by foreign entities 
repatriation of cash held by foreign entities could be subject to adverse tax implications 
we may also utilize our new secured credit facility see note or other new sources of financing to fund a portion of our capital needs and other commitments  including our contractual contingent consideration obligations and future acquisitions 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the million revolving line of credit of our secured credit facility  
table of contents and the full amount of that line of credit was available to us 
our ability to access the capital markets may be impacted by the amount of our outstanding debt and equity and the extent to which our assets are encumbered by our outstanding secured debt 
the terms and conditions of our outstanding debt instruments also contain covenants which expressly restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and conduct other financings 
as of december   we had billion in outstanding indebtedness comprised of billion under our secured credit facility  million of subordinated notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  million of senior notes due and million of senior subordinated convertible notes 
the applicable interest rate margins under our secured credit facility represent an increase of between approximately and depending on the type of loan and the type of interest rate involved and on our applicable leverage ratios over the applicable margins under our former secured credit facility  and as a result of this increase in applicable interest rate  the floor with respect to the base eurodollar rate as defined in the senior credit facility for b term loans and incremental b term loans under our secured credit facility that are based on the eurodollar rate  margins and the larger amount outstanding under our secured credit facility  we anticipate that our aggregate interest expense in future periods will exceed our aggregate interest expense in if the capital and credit markets experience volatility or the availability of funds is limited  we may incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments 
in addition  it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets could be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would like  or need  to do so  which could have an adverse impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt and or react to changing economic and business conditions 
our funding plans for our working capital needs and other commitments may be adversely impacted by unexpected costs associated with integrating the operations of newly acquired companies  executing our cost savings strategies and prosecuting and defending our existing lawsuits and or unforeseen lawsuits against us 
we also cannot be certain that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be realized 
in addition  we intend to continue to make significant investments in our research and development efforts related to the substantial intellectual property portfolio we own 
we may also choose to further expand our research and development efforts and may pursue the acquisition of new products and technologies through licensing arrangements  business acquisitions  or otherwise 
we may also choose to make significant investment to pursue legal remedies against potential infringers of our intellectual property rights 
if we decide to engage in such activities  or if our operating results fail to meet our expectations  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may be available only on terms which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible securities  dilution to then existing stockholders may result 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million  which we paid in cash 
in addition  we repurchased approximately  shares of our series b preferred stock at an average cost of per preferred share  an amount less than the weighted average fair value of the preferred shares at issuance

table of contents and million of principal payments on capital lease obligations 
these cash payments were offset by million of cash received from common stock issuances under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million in outstanding capital lease obligations which are payable through income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of domestic nol and capital loss carryforwards and million of foreign nol and capital loss carryforwards  respectively  which either expire on various dates through or may be carried forward indefinitely 
these losses are available to reduce federal  state and foreign taxable income  if any  in future years 
these losses are also subject to review and possible adjustments by the applicable taxing authorities 
in addition  the domestic nol carryforward amount at december  included approximately million of pre acquisition losses at matria  qas  paradigmhealth  biosite  cholestech  redwood  hemosense  ischemia  ostex international  ionian and twist 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard for business combinations 
prior to adoption of this standard  the pre acquisition losses were applied first to reduce to zero any goodwill and other non current intangible assets related to the acquisitions  prior to reducing our income tax expense 
upon adoption of the new accounting standard  the reduction of a valuation allowance is generally recorded to reduce our income tax expense 
furthermore  all domestic losses are subject to the internal revenue service code section limitation and may be limited in the event of certain cumulative changes in ownership interests of significant shareholders over a three year period in excess of 
section imposes an annual limitation on the use of these losses to an amount equal to the value of the company at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to our nols and certain of our other deferred tax assets to reflect uncertainties that might affect the realization of such deferred tax assets  as these assets can only be realized via profitable operations

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  
table of contents or gaap 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by our management and our audit committee to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application depends on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
in addition  the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  include a comprehensive summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we primarily recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenue is derived from product sales 
we recognize revenue upon title transfer of the products to third party customers  less a reserve for estimated product returns and allowances 
determination of the reserve for estimated product returns and allowances is based on our management s analyses and judgments regarding certain conditions 
should future changes in conditions prove management s conclusions and judgments on previous analyses to be incorrect  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
certain of our products require specialized installation 
revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period  or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements  and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element  in accordance with authoritative guidance on multiple element arrangements 
additionally  we generate services revenue in connection with contracts with health plans both commercial and governmental and self insured employers  whereby we provide clinical expertise through fee based arrangements 
revenue for fee based arrangements is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 
some contracts provide that a portion of our fees are at risk if our customers do not achieve certain financial cost savings or we do not achieve certain other clinical and operational metrics  over a period of time  typically one year 
revenue subject to refund is not recognized if i sufficient information is not available to calculate performance measurements or ii interim performance measurements indicate that we are not meeting performance targets 
if either of these two conditions exists  we record the amounts as other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet  deferring recognition of the revenue until we establish that we are meeting the performance criteria 
if we do not meet the performance targets at the end of the contractual period we are obligated under the contract to refund some or all of the at risk fees 
our deferred revenue balance was million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
we also receive license and royalty revenue from agreements with third party licensees 
revenue from fixed fee license and royalty agreements is recognized on a straight line basis over the obligation period of the related license agreements 
license and royalty fees that the licensees calculate based on their sales  which we have the right to audit under most of our agreements  are generally recognized upon receipt of the license or royalty payments  unless we are able to reasonably estimate 
table of contents the fees as they are earned 
license and royalty fees that are determinable prior to the receipt thereof are recognized in the period they are earned 
use of estimates for sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts certain sales arrangements require us to accept product returns 
from time to time  we also enter into sales incentive arrangements with our retail customers  which generally reduce the sale prices of our products 
as a result  we must establish allowances for potential future product returns and claims resulting from our sales incentive arrangements against product revenue recognized in any reporting period 
calculation of these allowances requires significant judgments and estimates 
when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances  our management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer and consumer demand and acceptance of our products 
when such analysis is not available and a right of return exists  we record revenue when the right of return is no longer applicable 
material differences in the amount and timing of our product revenue for any reporting period may result if changes in conditions arise that would require management to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
our total provision for sales returns and other allowances related to sales incentive arrangements amounted to million  million and million  or  and  respectively  of net product sales in  and  respectively  which have been recorded against product sales to derive our net product sales 
of these amounts  approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively  represent allowances for future deductions which have been provided against our related accruals for such charges with the balance charged directly against net sales 
similarly  our management must make estimates regarding uncollectible accounts receivable balances 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management analyzes specific accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms and patterns 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
inventory we state our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the estimated current market value of the inventory  less cost to sell 
in addition  we periodically review the inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
this provision reduces the carrying value of our inventory and is calculated based primarily upon factors such as forecasts of our customers demands  shelf lives of our products in inventory  loss of customers and manufacturing lead times 
evaluating these factors  particularly forecasting our customers demands  requires management to make assumptions and estimates 
actual product and services revenue may prove our forecasts to be inaccurate  in which case we may have underestimated or overestimated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
if  in future periods  our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize the excess value as a charge to our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if  in future periods  our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we would have over reported our cost of sales  or understated our earnings  at the time we recorded the excess and obsolete provision 
our inventory balance was million and million  net of a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
goodwill and other long lived and intangible assets our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   the balances of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were million  billion and billion  respectively 

table of contents goodwill relates to amounts that arose in connection with our various business combinations and represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to periodic review for impairment 
we test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests  if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment test  we utilize the two step approach 
the first step  or step  requires a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units for step  we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  or dcf  and calculates the fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after tax cash flows to a present value  using a risk adjusted discount rate 
assumptions used in the dcf require the exercise of significant judgment  including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values  growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
the forecasted cash flows are based on our most recent budget and for years beyond the budget  our estimates are based on assumed growth rates 
we believe our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 
the discount rates  which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections  used in the dcf are based on estimates of the weighted average cost of capital  or wacc  of market participants relative to each respective reporting unit 
the market approach considers comparable market data based on multiples of revenue or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we are required to perform the second step  or step  of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value of its assets and liabilities 
to the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
we based our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  including estimates of future growth rates and operating margins and assumptions about the overall economic climate and the competitive environment for our business units 
there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill and identifiable intangible asset testing as of the time of testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding business plans  competitive environments or anticipated growth rates are not correct  we may be required to record goodwill and or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or earlier  if an indicator of an impairment is present before our next annual evaluation 
impairment charges related to goodwill have no impact on our cash balances or compliance with financial covenants under our amended and restated credit agreement 
annual goodwill impairment test we conducted our annual impairment test for our reporting units during the fourth quarter of key assumptions which vary by reporting unit used in determining fair value under the discounted 
table of contents cash flow approach included discount rates ranging from to  projected compound average revenue growth rates of to and terminal value growth rates of 
in determining the appropriate discount rate  we considered the wacc for each reporting unit  which among other factors considers the cost of common equity capital and the marginal cost of debt of market participants 
key assumptions which again vary by reporting unit used in determining fair value under the market approach were based on observed market multiples of enterprise value to revenue and ebitda for both comparable publicly traded companies and recent merger and acquisition transactions involving similar companies to estimate appropriate controlling basis multiples to apply to each of the reporting units 
based on the multiples implied by this market data  we selected multiples of revenue of to times and multiples of ebitda of to times 
in assessing the reasonableness of our estimated fair values of the reporting units  management compared the results of the valuation analyses against our then current market capitalization to imply a control premium 
based on this analysis  the implied control premium was within the range of comparable industry transactions 
the step impairment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of our health management reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
as a result  we were required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment charges for the health management reporting unit 
we completed step  consistent with the procedures described above  and determined that a goodwill impairment charge in the amount of approximately million was required 
the resulting goodwill impairment charge is reflected in operating income loss in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
annual goodwill impairment test we conducted our annual impairment test for our reporting units during the fourth quarter of key assumptions which vary by reporting unit used in determining fair value under the discounted cash flow approach included discount rates ranging from to  projected compound average revenue growth rates of to and terminal value growth rates of 
in determining the appropriate discount rate  we considered the wacc for each reporting unit  which among other factors considers the cost of common equity capital and the marginal cost of debt of market participants 
key assumptions which again vary by reporting unit used in determining fair value under the market approach were based on observed market multiples of enterprise value to revenue and ebitda for both comparable publicly traded companies and recent merger and acquisition transactions involving similar companies to estimate appropriate controlling basis multiples to apply to each of the reporting units 
based on the multiples implied by this market data  we selected multiples of revenue of to times and multiples of ebitda of to times 
in assessing the reasonableness of our estimated fair values of the reporting units  management compared the results of the valuation analyses against our then current market capitalization to imply a control premium 
based on this analysis  the implied control premium was within the range of comparable industry transactions 
the step impairment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of our health management reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
as a result  we were required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment charges for the health management reporting unit 
we completed step  consistent with the procedures described above  and determined that a goodwill impairment charge in the amount of approximately billion was required 
the resulting goodwill impairment charge is reflected in operating income loss in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of other long lived tangible and intangible assets factors we generally consider important which could trigger an impairment review on the carrying value of other long lived tangible and intangible assets include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant 
table of contents changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  underutilization of our tangible assets  discontinuance of product lines by ourselves or our customers  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value and goodwill impairment identified during an impairment review 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment test for our reporting units during the fourth quarter 
the impairment tests conducted during and indicated there was an impairment of goodwill associated with our health management reporting unit  and thus  a potential impairment of our long lived tangible and intangible assets associated with the same reporting unit 
we conducted an analysis as prescribed under asc property  plant and equipment  utilizing an undiscounted cash flow model 
the analysis conducted during and indicated there was no impairment of the long lived tangible or intangible assets associated with our health management reporting unit 
although we believe that the carrying value of our long lived tangible and intangible assets was realizable as of december  and  future events could cause us to conclude otherwise 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
our expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected term is based on the assumption that all outstanding options will be exercised at the midpoint of the vesting date and the full contractual term  including data on experience to date 
as stock based compensation expense is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals and lives assigned to long lived and intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within our tax provision 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to the future benefits  if any  from our deferred tax assets related primarily to our foreign businesses and certain us net operating losses  or nols  and tax credits 
included in this valuation allowance is million for deferred tax assets of acquired companies  the future benefits of which will be generally applied to reduce our income tax expense 
this is an increase of million from the valuation allowance of million as of december  the increase is primarily related to domestic state nols 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income 
table of contents by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce our current valuation allowance which could materially impact our tax provision 
we established reserves for tax uncertainties that reflect the use of the comprehensive model for the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
we are currently undergoing routine tax examinations by us federal  various state and foreign jurisdictions 
tax authorities periodically challenge certain transactions and deductions we reported on our income tax returns 
we do not expect the outcome of these examinations  either individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
loss contingencies in the section of this annual report on form k titled part i  item  legal proceedings  we have reported on material legal proceedings  if any 
because of the nature of our business  we may be subject at any particular time to lawsuits or other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business  and we expect that this will continue to be the case in the future 
we do not accrue for potential losses on legal proceedings where our company is the defendant when we are not able to reasonably estimate our potential liability  if any  due to uncertainty as to the nature  extent and validity of the claims against us  uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the damages or other relief sought by the plaintiff and the complexity of the issues involved 
our potential liability  if any  in a particular case may become reasonably estimable and probable as the case progresses  in which case we will begin accruing for the expected loss

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our investing and financing activities 
in addition  our ability to finance future acquisition transactions or fund working capital requirements may be impacted if we are not able to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates 
to manage our interest rate exposure  our strategy is to invest in short term  highly liquid investments 
our investment policy also requires investment in approved instruments with an initial maximum allowable maturity of eighteen months and an average maturity of our portfolio that should not exceed six months  with at least  cash available at all times 
currently  our short term investments are in money market funds with original maturities of days or less 
at december   our short term investments approximated market value 
at december   under the credit agreement for our secured credit facility we had i term loans in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of billion consisting of a term loans in the 
table of contents aggregate principal amount of million  b term loans in the aggregate principal amount of million and incremental b term loans in the aggregate principal amount of million  and ii subject to our continued compliance with the credit agreement  the ability to borrow under a million revolving line of credit  which includes a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
loans can be either base rate loans or eurodollar rate loans at our election  and interest accrues on loans and our other obligations under the terms of the credit agreement as follows with the terms referenced above and below in this paragraph having the meanings given to them in the credit agreement i in the case of loans that are base rate loans  at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the base rate and the applicable margin  each as in effect from time to time  ii in the case of loans that are eurodollar rate loans  at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the eurodollar rate and the applicable margin  each as in effect for the applicable interest period  and iii in the case of other obligations  at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the base rate and the applicable margin for revolving loans that are base rate loans  each as in effect from time to time 
the base rate is a floating rate which approximates the us prime rate as in effect from time to time 
the eurodollar rate is equal to the libor rate and is set for a period of one  two  three or six months at our election 
applicable margins for our a term loans  delayed draw term loans and revolving line of credit loans range from i with respect to such loans that are base rate loans  to and ii with respect to such loans that are eurodollar rate loans  to  in each case  depending upon our consolidated secured leverage ratio as determined under the credit agreement 
applicable margins for our b term loans and incremental b term loans range from i with respect to such loans that are base rate loans  to and ii with respect to such loans that are eurodollar rate loans  to  in each case  depending upon our consolidated secured leverage ratio 
interest on b term loans and incremental b term loans based on the eurodollar rate is subject to a floor with respect to the base eurodollar rate 
assuming no changes in our consolidated secured leverage ratio  the effect of interest rate fluctuations on outstanding borrowings as of december  over the next twelve months is quantified and summarized as follows in thousands interest expense increase interest rates payable by us increase by basis points interest rates payable by us increase by basis points foreign currency risk we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates whenever we  or any of our subsidiaries  enter into transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our  or its  functional currency 
intercompany transactions between entities that use different functional currencies also expose us to foreign currency risk 
during  the net impact of foreign currency changes on transactions was a loss of million 
gross margins of products we manufacture at our foreign plants and sell in us dollars or manufacture in our us plants and sell in currencies other than the us dollar are also affected by foreign currency exchange rate movements 
our gross margin on total net product sales was in if the us dollar had been stronger by  or  compared to the actual rates during  our gross margin on total net product sales would have been  and  respectively 
in addition  because a substantial portion of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries  whose functional currencies are other than the us dollar in which we report our consolidated financial results  our earnings could be materially impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates upon the translation of the earnings of such subsidiaries into the us dollar 

table of contents if the us dollar had been uniformly stronger by  or  compared to the actual average exchange rates used to translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries  our net product sales and net income would have been impacted by approximately the following amounts in thousands approximate decrease in net revenue approximate decrease in net income if  during  the us dollar was stronger by
