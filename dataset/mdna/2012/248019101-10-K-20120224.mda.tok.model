we expect providing products and services that differentiate us from the competition will help partially offset the impacts of the decline in check usage and the pricing pressures we are experiencing in our check programs 
as such  we also continue to focus on accelerating the pace at which we introduce new products and services 
in addition to our various marketing solutions and other service offerings  we continue to offer our knowledge exchangetm series  a suite of resources and events for our financial institution clients focused on topics that most impact financial institutions core strategies 
direct checks our strategies within direct checks are as follows maximize the lifetime value of customers by selling new features  accessories and products  continue to optimize our cost and expense structure  and optimize cash flow 
in april  we acquired custom direct  inc  a provider of direct to consumer checks  in a cash transaction for million  net of cash acquired 
we have leveraged this acquisition to build a best in class  direct to consumer check experience 
additionally  we continue to identify opportunities to lower our cost and expense structure in all functional areas  particularly in the areas of marketing and fulfillment 
we continue to actively market our products and services through targeted advertising  including a continued focus on the internet channel 
we continue to explore avenues to increase sales to existing customers 
for example  we have had success with the ezshieldtm offering  a check protection service that provides reimbursement to consumers for losses resulting from forged signatures or endorsements and altered checks 
cost reduction initiatives for several years we have been pursuing cost reduction and business simplification initiatives  including reducing shared services infrastructure costs  streamlining our call center and fulfillment activities  eliminating system and work stream redundancies  reducing advertising costs  and strengthening our ability to quickly develop new products and services and bring them to market 
we have reduced stock keeping units skus  standardized products and services and improved the sourcing of third party goods and services 
as a result of all of these efforts  we realized net cost savings of approximately million during  as compared to our results of operations 
approximately one third of these savings impacted cost of goods sold  while the remaining two thirds impacted selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
we anticipate that we will realize additional net cost reductions of approximately million in  as compared to our results of operations  which will be generated primarily by our fulfillment  sales and marketing  and information technology organizations 
approximately of these savings are expected to impact cost of goods sold  with the remaining affecting sg a expense 
outlook for we anticipate that consolidated revenue will be between billion and billion for  as compared to billion for in small business services  we expect the percentage increase in revenue to be in the middle to high single digits compared to revenue of million  as declines in core business products are expected to be more than offset by the benefits of our e commerce investments  price increases  and growth in our distributor and dealer channels and in our marketing solutions and other services offerings 
in financial services  we expect the percentage decrease in revenue to be in the low to mid single digits compared to revenue of million  driven by continued check order declines of approximately seven to eight percent  partially offset by higher revenue per order  a new large customer which began contributing volume early in the first quarter of  and continued contributions from marketing solutions and other services offerings 
in direct checks  we expect the percentage decrease in revenue to be in the middle to high single digits compared to revenue of million  driven by check usage declines 
we expect that diluted earnings per share will be between and  compared to for  which included total estimated charges of per share related to restructuring related costs  losses on debt retirements  transaction costs related to acquisitions  and an asset impairment charge 
we expect that the benefit of our cost reduction activities will be partially offset by continued investments in revenue growth opportunities and increases in material and delivery rates 
we estimate that our annual effective tax rate for will be approximately  the same as in 
table of contents we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities will be between million and million in  compared to million in  driven by higher earnings in the middle to upper end of our outlook range  partially offset by higher income tax payments 
we estimate that capital spending will be approximately million in as we continue to invest in key revenue growth initiatives and order fulfillment and information technology infrastructure 
we believe that cash generated by operating activities  along with our credit facility  will be sufficient to support our operations  including capital expenditures  small to medium sized acquisitions  required debt service and dividend payments  for the next months 
this includes payments of million which are due in december when a portion of our long term notes matures 
we are focused on a disciplined approach to capital deployment that focuses on our need to continue investing in initiatives to drive revenue growth  including small to medium sized acquisitions 
we also anticipate that our board of directors will maintain our current dividend level 
however  dividends are approved by the board of directors on a quarterly basis  and thus are subject to change 
to the extent we have cash flow in excess of these priorities  our focus during will be on further reducing our debt if we are able to purchase our long term notes on the open market  or we may complete share repurchases to offset the dilution of shares issued under our employee stock incentive plan 
during  we retired million of our long term notes due in and million of our long term notes due in we also completed the issuance of million of long term notes due in  collecting net proceeds of million 
because we had no amounts drawn on our credit facility at the end of  we may accumulate larger investment balances during as we prepare to pay the million of long term debt which is due in december business challenges market risks market for checks and business forms the market for our two largest products  checks and business forms  is very competitive 
these products are mature and their use has been declining 
the total number of checks written in the united states has been in decline as a result of alternative payment methods  including credit cards  debit cards  automated teller machines  direct deposit  and electronic and other bill paying services 
according to a federal reserve study released in december  the most recent information available  approximately billion checks were written in according to this study  checks are no longer the largest single non cash payment method in the united states  being surpassed by the debit card 
checks written account for approximately of all non cash payment transactions  which is a reduction from the federal reserve study released in december when checks accounted for approximately of all non cash payment transactions 
the federal reserve estimates that checks written declined approximately per year between and  and we expect this trend to continue 
in addition to the decline in check usage  the use of business forms is also under pressure 
continual technological improvements provide small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  off the shelf business software applications  electronic transaction systems and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre printed business forms products 
financial institution clients because check usage is declining  we have been encountering significant pricing pressure when negotiating contracts with our financial institution clients 
financial institutions seek to maintain the profits they have historically generated from their check programs  despite the decline in check usage 
our traditional financial institution relationships are typically formalized through check supply contracts averaging three to six years in duration 
as we compete to retain and acquire new financial institution business  the resulting pricing pressure  combined with declining check usage in the marketplace  has reduced our revenue and profit margins 
we expect these trends to continue 
turmoil in the financial services industry  which began in late  led to increased bank failures and consolidations 
there could be a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations if we were to lose a significant amount of business and or we were unable to recover the value of unamortized contract acquisition costs or accounts receivable 
as of december   unamortized contract acquisition costs totaled million  while liabilities for contract acquisition costs not paid as of december  were million 
the inability to recover amounts paid to one or more of our larger financial institution clients could have a significant negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
the consolidation of financial institutions may also impact our results of operations 
in the past we have occasionally acquired new clients as financial institutions that were not our clients consolidated with our clients 
when two of our financial institution clients consolidate  the increase in general negotiating leverage possessed by the consolidated entity could result in a new contract which is not as favorable to us as those historically negotiated with the clients individually 
however  we may also generate non recurring conversion revenue when obsolete checks have to be replaced after one financial institution merges with or acquires another 
conversely  we have also lost financial institution clients when they consolidated with financial institutions which were not our clients 
if we were to lose a significant amount of business in this manner  it could have a significant negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in such situations  we have typically collected contract termination payments and we may be able to do so in similar circumstances in the future 

table of contents economic conditions general economic conditions had a continued negative impact on our results of operations 
small business confidence and the rate of small business formations impact small business services 
the index of small business optimism published by the national federation of independent business was in january and ended the year at  after dipping as low as in august 
the year did end positively  with four consecutive monthly increases 
however  the december outlook for expected business conditions in six months dropped points from january according to estimates of the small business administration s office of advocacy  the last year in which the number of small businesses increased was consumer spending and employment levels have some impact on our personal check businesses 
modest consumer spending growth  along with only moderate private sector growth in employment during  continued to impact our personal check businesses 
we expect that general economic conditions will continue to be challenging in a continued sluggish economy could result in additional declines in our revenue and profitability

these revenue increases were partially offset by lower order volume for our personal check businesses  revenue of million in from a contract settlement  continued pricing pressure within financial services  and the recognition of deferred revenue in from a contract settlement executed in the fourth quarter of the revenue of million from the contract settlement recognized in accounted for a revenue decrease of percentage points in it related to a settlement with a large financial institution that acquired one of our clients and chose to consolidate its check printing business with another provider

we evaluate gross margin when analyzing our consolidated results of operations as we believe it provides important insight into significant profit drivers 
as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from the sale of manufactured and purchased products  we believe the measure of gross margin best demonstrates our manufacturing and distribution performance  as well as the impact of pricing on our profitability 
gross margin is not a complete measure of profitability  as it omits sg a expense 
however  it is a financial measure which we believe is useful in evaluating our results of operations 
gross margin for was the same as in manufacturing and delivery efficiencies and other benefits resulting from our continued cost reduction initiatives  as well as the benefit of price increases  were offset by the million contract settlement in  higher material costs and delivery rates  and the recognition of deferred revenue in from a financial services contract settlement executed in the fourth quarter of the million contract settlement in contributed percentage points to gross margin in gross margin increased for  as compared to  due primarily to the higher revenue per order discussed earlier  including the million contract settlement which contributed percentage points of the increase in gross margin  as well as manufacturing and delivery efficiencies and other benefits resulting from our cost reduction initiatives

the increase in interest expense for  as compared to  was due  in part  to our higher average interest rate in also contributing to the increase in interest expense were charges of million driven by the retirement of long term notes during the first quarter of the debt retirements required that we accelerate the recognition of a portion of a derivative loss  and we recognized expense related to the settlement of a portion of our interest rate swap agreements 
these increases in interest expense were partially offset by our lower average debt level in the decrease in interest expense for  as compared to  was primarily due to a favorable impact of million from interest rates swaps and our lower average debt level in during the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of our long term debt

table of contents other financial position information contract acquisition costs other non current assets include contract acquisition costs of our financial services segment 
these costs  which are essentially pre paid product discounts  are recorded as non current assets upon contract execution and are amortized  generally on the straight line basis  as reductions of revenue over the related contract term 
cash payments made for contract acquisition costs were million for  million for and million for we anticipate cash payments of approximately million in changes in contract acquisition costs during the last three years were as follows in thousands balance  beginning of year additions amortization other balance  end of year the number of checks being written has been in decline since the mid s  which has contributed to increased competitive pressure when attempting to retain or acquire clients 
both the number of financial institution clients requesting contract acquisition payments and the amount of the payments has fluctuated significantly from year to year 
although we anticipate that we will selectively continue to make contract acquisition payments  we cannot quantify future amounts with certainty 
the amount paid depends on numerous factors such as the number and timing of contract executions and renewals  competitors actions  overall product discount levels and the structure of up front product discount payments versus providing higher discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
when the overall discount level provided for in a contract is unchanged  contract acquisition costs do not result in lower net revenue 
these payments impact the timing of cash flows 
an up front cash payment is made rather than providing higher product discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
liabilities for contract acquisition payments are recorded upon contract execution 
these obligations are monitored for each contract and are adjusted as payments are made 
contract acquisition payments due within the next year are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these accruals were million as of december  and million as of december  accruals for contract acquisition payments included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were million as of december  and million as of december  funds held for customers our canadian payroll services business collects funds from clients to pay their payroll and related taxes 
we hold these funds temporarily until payments are remitted to the clients employees and the appropriate taxing authorities 
funds held for customers of million as of december  increased million from december  the increase in funds held for customers  and the corresponding accrued liability  was due primarily to an increase in the number of payroll services customers 
foreign cash and investments as of december   our subsidiaries located in canada held cash and marketable securities of million 
deferred income taxes have not been recognized on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as these amounts are intended to be reinvested indefinitely in the operations of those subsidiaries 
if we were to repatriate the cash and marketable securities into the us  we would incur a us tax liability of approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements  guarantees and contractual obligations it is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements or to guarantee the performance of third parties 
in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as product or service defects  including breach of security  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by our breach of terms of the contract 
in disposing of assets or businesses  we often provide representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks  including  for example  unknown damage to the assets  environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate  liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities  and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition 
we do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  we have no reason to believe that any likely liability under these indemnities would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  annual results of operations or annual cash flows 
we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications related to environmental matters 
further information can be found under the caption note other commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 

table of contents we are not engaged in any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other third parties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity or on our access to  or requirements for  capital resources

we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for the purchase of inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are not included in the purchase obligations presented here  as our business partners typically allow us to cancel these purchase orders as necessary to accommodate business needs 
of the purchase obligations included in the table above  million allow for early termination upon the payment of early termination fees 
if we were to terminate these agreements  we would have incurred early termination fees of million as of december  other long term liabilities presented in our consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of amounts due for our postretirement benefit plan and liabilities for uncertain tax positions  deferred compensation and workers compensation 
of the million reported as other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   million is excluded from the obligations shown in the table above 
the excluded amounts  including the current portion of each liability  are comprised primarily of the following benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plan we have contributed funds to this plan for the purpose of funding our obligations 
thus  we have the option of paying benefits from the assets of the plan or from the general funds of the company 
additionally  we expect the plan assets to earn income over time 
as such  we cannot predict when or if payments from our general funds will be required 
as of december   our postretirement benefit plan was underfunded million 
payments for uncertain tax positions due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended timeframe often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties  we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities

table of contents related party transactions we have not entered into any material related party transactions during the past three years 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
our accounting policies are discussed under the caption note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
the estimates and judgments utilized are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee of our board of directors at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
application of critical accounting policies we consider the estimates discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions could be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as of december   goodwill was comprised of the following in thousands acquisition of new england business service nebs in june acquisition of designer checks in february acquisition of hostopia

goodwill and our indefinite lived trade name are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of july  or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment 
we completed events driven impairment analyses of goodwill and our indefinite lived trade name during the first quarter of due to declines in our stock price coupled with the continuing negative impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results 
in addition to the required impairment analyses  we regularly evaluate the remaining useful life of our indefinite lived trade name to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if we would determine that this asset has a finite useful life  we would test the asset for impairment and then amortize the asset s remaining carrying value over its estimated remaining useful life 

table of contents the estimate of fair value for the indefinite lived trade name is based on a relief from royalty method  which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the trade name 
an assumed royalty rate is applied to forecasted revenue and the resulting cash flows are discounted 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
the annual impairment analysis completed during the third quarter of indicated that the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived trade name exceeded its carrying value of million by approximately million 
in this analysis  we assumed a discount rate of and a royalty rate of 
a one half percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by million and a one half percentage point decrease in the royalty rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by approximately million 
during the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million in our small business services segment related to the indefinite lived trade name 
during the quarter ended september   we adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment 
this new standard gives us the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less that its carrying amount 
if  after this qualitative assessment  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step quantitative impairment test is unnecessary 
in completing our annual impairment analysis  we elected to perform this qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units to which goodwill is assigned 
as such  we completed a qualitative analysis of goodwill  evaluating factors including  but not limited to  economic  market and industry conditions  cost factors and the overall financial performance of the reporting units 
we also considered the quantitative analysis we completed as of july  in which the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by amounts between million and million  or by amounts between and above the carrying values of their net assets 
in our qualitative analysis  we noted no changes in events or circumstances which would have required us to complete the two step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for any of our reporting units 
as such  no impairment charges were recorded as a result of our annual impairment analysis 
in previous years  a two step  quantitative approach was required in evaluating goodwill for impairment 
first  we would calculate the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned and compare this estimated fair value to the carrying amount of its net assets 
in calculating the estimated fair value  we utilized the income approach 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting unit s financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant 
using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques  we projected revenue for the next five years 
we applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows 
a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream 
future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value 
the discount rate used was the value weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics 
in determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units  we were required to estimate a number of factors  including projected future operating results  terminal growth rates  economic conditions  anticipated future cash flows  the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items 
for reasonableness  the summation of our reporting units fair values was compared to our consolidated fair value as indicated by our market capitalization plus an appropriate control premium 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s net assets exceeded its estimated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis required us to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount 
to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  is estimated 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amount assigned to its assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
based on the events driven impairment analysis completed during the first quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our small business services segment related to one of our reporting units 
if our stock price declines in the future for a sustained period or if we are required to significantly reduce our forecasted operating results because of a continuing downturn in economic conditions or due to changes in other circumstances  it may be indicative of a decline in our fair value and could require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and or our indefinite lived trade name 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future events  market conditions  and financial performance over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from our assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change  we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 

table of contents income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax credits allowed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in interim reporting periods  we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate based on the facts available at the time 
changes in the mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact our estimated effective tax rate in interim periods 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the interim period during which the unusual or one time item occurred 
the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
tax laws require certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense  net of the expected tax benefit  in our statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we had net deferred tax liabilities of million as of december   including valuation allowances of million 
as of december   we had net deferred tax liabilities of million  including valuation allowances of million 
the valuation allowances as of december  related primarily to operating loss carryforwards in ireland which we do not expect to realize 
as of december   the valuation allowances related primarily to operating loss carryforwards in canada which we reversed during  as we now expect to realize the loss carryforwards in and or in future years 
we are subject to tax audits in numerous domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
tax audits are often complex and can require several years to complete 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to challenges from the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions  or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
we recognize the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements when they are more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties and the federal benefit of deductible state income tax 
if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in our consolidated financial statements  million would positively affect income tax expense and our related effective tax rate 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   we had accrued million of interest and penalties  excluding the tax benefit of deductible interest 
the statute of limitations for federal tax assessments for and prior years has closed 
our federal income tax returns through have been audited by the irs  our and returns are currently being audited  and our returns for and remain subject to irs examination 
in general  income tax returns for the years through remain subject to examination by foreign  state and city tax jurisdictions 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdiction 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution would result in reduced income tax expense 
changes in unrecognized tax benefits during the last three years can be found under the caption note income tax provision of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
within the next months  it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will change in the range of a decrease of million to an increase of million as we attempt to settle certain federal and state matters or as federal and state statutes of limitations expire 
we are not able to predict what  if any  impact these changes may have on our effective tax rate or cash flows 
during  we recorded income tax expense of million to reduce our deferred tax asset related to our postretirement benefit plan 
this expense resulted from the health care and education reconciliation act of  which was signed into law in march  and requires that certain tax deductions after be reduced by the amount of medicare part d subsidy payments 
prior to this law change  the subsidy was to be disregarded in all future years when computing tax deductions 
during  we took actions to restore approximately million of this deferred tax asset  and we expect to restore additional amounts in as we fund our postretirement benefit plan 

table of contents during  we reduced our income tax provision million for amendments to prior year tax returns claiming refunds primarily associated with federal and state tax credits and the funding of medical costs through our veba trust  as well as the related interest 
postretirement benefit plan detailed information regarding our postretirement benefit plan  including a description of the plan  its related future cash flows  plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used in accounting for the plan  can be found under the caption note pension and other postretirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
our net postretirement benefit expense was million for  million for and million for our business segments record postretirement benefit expense in cost of goods sold and sg a expense  based on the composition of their workforces 
our postretirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the expected health care cost trend rate and the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 
we analyze the assumptions used each year when we complete our actuarial valuation of the plan 
the effects of changes to our assumptions are recognized immediately on the consolidated balance sheet  but are generally amortized into earnings over future periods  with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if the assumptions utilized in determining our postretirement benefit expense and liability differ from actual events  our results of operations for future periods are impacted 
discount rate the discount rate is used to reflect the time value of money 
it is the assumed rate at which future postretirement benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality  fixed income instruments currently available whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the aon hewitt aa above median curve and the citigroup pension discount yield curves to discount each cash flow stream at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present value of each cash flow stream is aggregated and used to impute a weighted average discount rate 
the discount rate established at year end for purposes of calculating our benefit obligation is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit expense for the following year 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   we assumed a discount rate of 
a point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million  and would increase or decrease our postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets the long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for expected benefit payments 
in determining this rate  we utilize our historical returns and then adjust these returns for estimated inflation 
our inflation assumption is primarily based on historical inflation data 
in measuring net postretirement benefit expense for  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
a point change in this assumption would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
expected health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend rate represents the expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided due to factors other than changes in the demographics of plan participants 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   our initial health care inflation rate for was assumed to be 
our ultimate health care inflation rate was assumed to be in and beyond 
a one percentage point change in the health care inflation rate for each year would have the following effects in thousands one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease effect on total of service and interest cost effect on benefit obligation average remaining life expectancy of plan participants in determining the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants  our actuaries use a mortality table which includes estimated death rates for each age 
we use the rp combined healthy participant table with fully generational mortality improvements projected using scale aa 

table of contents when actual events differ from our assumptions or when we change the assumptions used  an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss results 
the gain or loss is recognized immediately in the consolidated balance sheet within accumulated comprehensive loss and is amortized into postretirement benefit expense 
effective april   we amended our postretirement benefit plan to decrease the minimum age for eligibility to receive the maximum available benefits from age to age and to decrease the service requirement for maximum retiree cost sharing from years to years 
prior to the april  plan amendment and re measurement  unrecognized actuarial gains and losses were being amortized over the average remaining service period of plan participants  which was years as of december  because the plan amendment increased the number of participants currently eligible to receive the maximum available benefits  almost all of the plan participants were classified as inactive subsequent to the plan amendment 
as such  actuarial gains and losses are required to be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants  which was years as of april  this change resulted in a million decrease in postretirement benefit expense for  as compared to the expense we had expected for prior to the plan amendments 
the fair value of our postretirement benefit plan assets is subject to various risks  including credit  interest and overall market volatility risks 
during  the equity markets experienced a significant decline in value  resulting in a significant decrease in the fair value of our plan assets 
this materially affected the funded status of the plan and resulted in higher postretirement benefit expense in subsequent years 
if the equity and bond markets decline in future periods  the funded status of our plan could again be materially affected 
this could result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future  as well as the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund the benefits payable under the plan  although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable 
we did not use plan assets to make benefit payments during or rather  we used cash provided by operating activities to make these payments 
restructuring accruals over the past several years  we have recorded restructuring accruals as a result of facility closings and other cost management efforts 
cost management is one of our strategic objectives and we are continually seeking ways to lower our cost structure 
these accruals primarily consist of employee termination benefits payable under our ongoing severance benefit plan 
we record accruals for employee termination benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
as such  judgment is involved in determining when it is appropriate to record restructuring accruals 
additionally  we are required to make estimates and assumptions in calculating the restructuring accruals  as on some occasions  employees choose to voluntarily leave the company prior to their termination date or they secure another position within the company 
in these situations  the employees do not receive termination benefits 
to the extent our assumptions and estimates differ from our actual costs  subsequent adjustments to restructuring accruals have been and will be required 
we reversed previously recorded restructuring accruals of million in  million in and million in  primarily as a result of fewer employees receiving severance benefits than originally estimated

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of the borrowing activities used to support our capital structure  maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the nature and amount of debt outstanding can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of december   our total debt was comprised of the following in thousands carrying amount fair value weighted average interest rate long term notes maturing december  including increase of related to the cumulative change in fair value of hedged debt long term notes maturing october  including increase of  related to the cumulative change in fair value of hedged debt long term notes maturing june long term notes maturing march total debt fair value is based on quoted market prices as of december  for identical liabilities when traded as assets 
as these notes were not publicly traded as of december   fair value was determined by means of a pricing model utilizing readily observable market interest rates and data from trades executed by institutional investors 
we may  from time to time  retire outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or by other means 
any such repurchases or exchanges would depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements and other potential uses of cash  including acquisitions or share repurchases 
we have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value of our long term debt due in and in as of december   interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million were designated as fair value hedges 
the carrying amount of long term debt as of december  included a million increase related to adjusting the hedged debt for changes in its fair value 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the related long term debt are included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
when the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the hedged debt are not equal ie  hedge ineffectiveness  the difference in the changes in fair value affects the reported amount of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
information regarding hedge ineffectiveness can be found under the caption note fair value measurements of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 

table of contents based on the outstanding variable rate debt in our portfolio  a one percentage point change in interest rates would have resulted in a million change in interest expense for  excluding any hedge ineffectiveness related to our interest rate swaps 
we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
investments in  loans and advances to foreign subsidiaries and branches  as well as the operations of these businesses  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar 
the effect of exchange rate changes is expected to have a minimal impact on our results of operations and cash flows  as our foreign operations represent a relatively small portion of our business
