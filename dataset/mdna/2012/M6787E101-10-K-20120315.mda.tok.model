merger on july   vocaltec  an israeli public company listed on nasdaq  entered into and consummated the merger agreement with ymax 
vocaltec provides carrier class voip and convergence solutions for fixed and wireless communication service providers 
the combination of intellectual property rights and softphone and softswitch technology were the primary drivers behind the merger with vocaltec 
as a result of the merger with vocaltec  the combined company gained royalty free access to all vocaltec s intellectual property rights and related technology 
vocaltec was in the same line of business as ymax  and we do not expect the future revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses of pre merger vocaltec to have a material impact in our results of operations 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each share of ymax common stock outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the business combination was cancelled 
ymax shareholders received  shares of vocaltec in total  representing in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding shares of the combined company after the transaction 
as a result  this transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and ymax was accounting acquirer 
vocaltec became the continuing legal entity and parent  and ymax became a wholly owned subsidiary of vocaltec

the ordinary shares held by vocaltec shareholders and the results of vocaltec s operations are included in consolidated financial statements for periods after the date of business combination 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
such estimates and judgments are revised periodically as required 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include allowances for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts  the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  the value of ordinary shares issued in business combinations or underlying the company s ordinary share options  the expected forfeitures of ordinary share options and estimates of likely outcomes related to certain contingent liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
our estimates and assumptions are based on factors such as historical experience  trends within the company and the telecommunications industry  general economic conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances

critical accounting policies we have identified below our critical accounting policies 
these policies are both the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments and estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenues consists of revenue from sales of the magicjack and magicjack plus to retailers  wholesalers or directly to customers  license renewal fees  fees charged for shipping the magicjack and magicjack plus  usage of prepaid minutes  call termination charges to other carriers and other miscellaneous charges for telecommunication usage  sales of telecommunications hardware  software and related services 
revenue is recorded net of sales returns and allowances 
magicjack and magicjack plus revenue we recognize revenues from sales and shipping of direct sales of the magicjack and magicjack plus over the license period associated with the initial month license period 
customers may purchase licenses for continued use of our software to access our switches for additional years either when the original purchase is made  or at any time thereafter 
the revenue associated with a license for additional years is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended license period 
sales return policy we offer our direct sales customers a day free trial before they have to pay for their magicjack or magicjack plus unit 
we do not record or recognize revenue until the day trial period has expired and a customer s credit card has been charged 
returns from retailers are accepted on an authorized basis 
we have offered certain retailers the right to return any unsold merchandise from their initial stocking orders 
we estimate potential returns under these arrangements at point of sale based and re estimate potential returns on a quarterly basis 
for the year ended december   and  our estimates of returns and actual returns from initial stocking orders have not been materially different 
telephony services revenue telephony revenue is recognized as minutes are used 
telephony revenue is generated from the usage of prepaid minutes  fees for origination of calls to numbers  access fees charged to other telecommunication carriers on a per minute basis for interexchange carriers ixc calls terminated on our switches  and wholesaling telephone service to voip providers and others telecommunication carriers 
revenues from access fee charges to other telecommunication carriers are recorded based on rates set forth in the respective state and federal tariffs  less a provision for billing adjustments of million  million and million for the year ended december   and  respectively 
we have estimated and provided allowances for billing adjustments of access charges to carrier customers 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item herein for further details 
sales of telecommunications hardware  software and service agreements revenues from sales of telecommunications hardware and our proprietary software meeting the criteria for recognition upon shipment are recognized at the time of shipment to customers 
similar revenues that do not meet the criteria for recognition upon shipment are recognized over the term of the related service agreements 
revenues from service agreements are recognized over the term generally one year of the service agreement 
service agreements include maintenance  technical support  training and upgrades 
if a service agreement for additional year s is purchased  the associated revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended term of the service agreement 
revenues from sales of parts  services not covered by a service agreement and custom design services are recognized as parts are shipped or services are performed 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that it estimates is more likely than not to be realized 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where there is a greater than likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where there is or less likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
stock based compensation stock based compensation generally consists of option grants or ordinary share awards to directors  officers  employees or consultants 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity based payment awards on the date of grant based on the fair value of the award 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated income statements 
the fair value of each option granted on the date of the business combination and in prior periods is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
in periods prior to the business combination  we estimated the fair value of the underlying ordinary share at the date of grant based on the valuation of our ordinary shares or on recent sales of our ordinary shares to non affiliated investors and the expected stock price volatility based on historical volatility within a representative peer group of public companies 
we estimated expected award life as the term of the options as there was no public market for our ordinary shares  and minimal forfeiture rates as all of our option grants had been fully vested at the date of grant 
subsequent to the business combination  the value of our ordinary shares was determined based on the closing price of our ordinary shares on the nasdaq 
we estimate forfeiture rates based on expected turnover estimates  and volatility based on historical volatility within a representative group of public companies 
no options were granted during years ended december  and  except that outstanding unvested options of vocaltec were considered as replacement grants on the date of the business combination 
the weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended december  and of approximately and  respectively  was measured at the date of grant using the following assumptions 
year ended december  expected life years years dividend yield expected volatility to risk free interest rate to forfeiture rate the risk free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield for comparable periods 
the expected life of stock options for employee grants represents the period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
we did not anticipate any forfeiture of the options granted during the year ended december  as all such options were fully vested at the date of grant 
we did not anticipate any forfeiture of the options granted during the year ended december  in connection with the business combination as options held by continuing employees were in the money and expected to vest 
we recognize compensation expenses for the value of our awards granted based on the straight line method over the requisite service period of each of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated in thousands 
the consolidated statements of operations below have been expanded to show the composition of our operating revenue and cost of revenues items to enable a more meaningful discussion of our operations

year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues total operating revenue was million and million for year ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
this decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to the following a million combined decrease in revenues recognized from the sale of the magicjack  primarily as a result of i sale of fewer magicjack units  and ii and lower average unit price due to a higher percentage of magicjack units being sold to retailers and distributors at wholesale prices as opposed to direct sales to customers at retail prices  offset in part by the company starting to recognize revenues on sales of magicjack plus units during the fourth quarter of  a million net decrease in access and termination charge revenue as a result of the company increasing the provision for billing adjustments  primarily as a result of the fcc november  order described in item  legal proceedings  offset by an increase in revenues from the sale of access to our servers and wholesale of voip services by a wholly owned subsidiary we acquired in november  and a million decrease in shipping and handling revenues primarily as a result of fewer magicjack units sold 
these decreases in operating revenue were partially offset by the following a million increase in renewal revenues as a result of the continued increase in the number of active customers beyond their first year of service  a million increase in the sale of magicjack related products  primarily driven by an increase in the sale of canadian numbers and porting fees  and a million increase in revenues from prepaid minutes as a result of an increase in the number of customers purchasing these services  which resulted in higher usage of prepaid minutes 
in the years ended december  and  sales of the magicjack and magicjack plus units through retail outlets represented approximately and  respectively  of sales of all magicjack units sold 
for the same periods  direct sales represented approximately and  respectively  of magicjack units sold

for the year ended december   one retailer  radioshack  accounted for approximately of the company s total operating revenues 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
this decrease in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to the following a million combined decrease in the cost of magicjack and magicjack plus units sold  and a decline in credit card processing fees resulting from the decrease in magicjack units sold and resolution of a legal settlement  and lower network and carrier charges due to better rates from telecommunication carriers 
these decreases in cost of revenues were partially offset by the following a million inventory write off  included in cost of magicjack and magicjack plus sold  a million increase in shipping and handling costs as a result of higher shipping unit costs  and higher amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired as part of the business combination as well as certain intangible assets purchased in june operating expenses total operating expenses was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
this decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a million decrease in research and development expenses as a result of lower personnel related costs driven by reduced headcount  partially offset by a million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of i a million increase in legal expenses as a result of the company recording accruals for certain expected legal settlements  and ii higher costs in vocaltec as a result of including twelve months of expenses in as compared to less than six months in due to the merger in july these increases in general and administrative expenses were offset in part by i lower personnel related costs allocated to general and administrative expenses as a result of reduced headcount  and ii reduced accounting related fees 
we believe we will be able to reduce legal expenses related to collection efforts and litigation in future periods due to i certain upcoming expected legal settlements  and ii more certainty for rules regarding billing and collections of access charges as a result of the fcc order of november  described in item  legal proceedings 
our combined advertising related expenses remained flat for the both the years ended december  and however  advertising related expenses have varied  and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter 
other income total other income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately million 
this increase in other income expense was due to changes in the items discussed below 
gains and losses on marketable securities realized gain loss on marketable securities for year ended december  was million  as compared to a realized loss on marketable securities of million in the year ended december  interest and dividend income interest and dividend income was million for both the years ended december  and the increase in our average invested cash in dividend generating investments during fully offset the lower average interest rates paid on our investments as a result our liquidation of certain high interest fixed income investments in early interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense for the year ended december  represented imputed interest as a result of recording the value of certain intangible assets we purchased in late june at fair value  which was lower than the sum of future payments we will make to the seller of these intangible assets 
interest expense for the year ended december  represented interest attributable to a note we issued in connection with our acquisition of vocaltec us 
that note was retired in early fair value gain on common equity put options fair value gain on common equity put options for year ended december  was million  as compared to for the year ended december  in  we sold common equity put option contracts in connection with our share repurchase program in order to lower the average share price paid for ordinary shares we purchases 
we recognized gains on such instruments as a result of i unrealized gains on outstanding common equity put option contracts outstanding as of december   and ii realized gains on common equity put option contracts exercised or expired during the year ended december gain on extinguishment of debt on april   the company paid million in full settlement of its liabilities to the sellers of stratus technologies bermuda ltd  including approximately million in accrued interest 
this prepayment resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately million

refer to note  income taxes  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item herein for further details as well as a reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to our effective tax rate

year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues total operating revenue was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
this increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the following a million increase in renewal revenues as a result of a higher number of customers beyond their first year of license  a million increase in revenues from prepaid international minutes as a result of an increase in the number of customers  which resulted in higher sales and usage of prepaid international minutes  million increase in revenues from magicjack related products  and a million increase in other revenues primarily due to the revenues from vocaltec since the business combination in july  partially offset by lower revenues in one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  and a million increase in revenues generated by termination and access charges as the number of calls terminated in our switches increased 
we believe that over the long term  our access charge revenue will decrease as either regulation applicable to the current access charge system is changed or as we are able to enter into direct connect agreements with other carriers 
any decreases in future access charge revenue could in part be offset by decreases in access related costs 
these increases in operating revenue were partially offset by the following a million decrease in revenues recognized for the sale of the magicjack primarily as a result of i sales to retailers including purchases by retailers to build up their inventories as compared to orders to replenish inventory in  and ii a decrease in the average price of units sold due to an higher percentage of magicjack units being sold to retailers and distributors at wholesale prices as opposed to direct sales to customers at retail prices  and a million decrease in shipping and handling revenues as a result of lower direct sales of magicjack units  in part due to an increasing percentage of magicjack units being sold to retailers and distributors as opposed to direct sales to customers

for the same periods  direct sales represented approximately and  respectively  of magicjack units sold

this decrease in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to the following a million decrease in cost of magicjack units sold  other cost of revenues decreased by million primarily due to i reduced costs related to our wholly owned subsidiary  vocaltec us  which was acquired in january  and ii a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses allocated to cost of sales as a result of certain fixed assets and intangible assets becoming fully amortized  offset by cost of revenues  including amortization expense  from vocaltec since the business combination in july  and lower shipping and handling costs primarily due to lower direct sales of magicjack units  in part due to an increasing percentage of magicjack units being sold to retailers and distributors as opposed to direct sales to customers 
these decreases in cost of revenues were partially offset by the following network and carrier charges increased by million resulting from i a higher number of active magicjack units  which resulted in higher number of calls made by our customers  and ii increased use of prepaid international minutes which resulted in higher international charges  and a million increase in credit card processing fees as a result of a significant increase in sale of prepaid international minutes and renewals  offset in part by lower direct sales of the magicjack 
operating expenses total operating expenses was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks that are inherent in our financial statements  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
exposure to interest rates the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without incurring investment market volatility risk 
our investment income is sensitive to the general level of united states interest rates 
in this regard  changes in the united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalent holdings  a movement in market interest rates would not materially impact on the total fair market value of our portfolio as of december  exposure to exchange rates our overseas expenses are incurred primarily in connection with the manufacturing of the magicjack and magicjack plus units and expenses related to our operations in israel 
the majority of our overseas expenses are influenced by exchange rate fluctuations in local currencies  including nis  hong kong dollars  taiwan dollars and chinese yuan 
due to the small percentage of our expenses that are influenced by exchange rate fluctuations  a movement in currency exchange rates would not materially impact our results of operations 
our results of operations are affected by a devaluation of the nis against the us dollar 
a devaluation of the nis in relation to the us dollar will have the effect of decreasing the us dollar value of some of our assets  mostly current assets  to the extent of the underlying value of which is nis based 
such a devaluation would also have the effect of reducing the dollar amount of any of our liabilities which are payable in nis  unless such payables are linked to the us dollar 
exposure to derivative instruments in  we started selling put option contracts in connection with our share repurchase program 
the primary objective of our sales of put option contracts in connection with our share repurchase program is to lower the average price paid for ordinary shares we purchase 
put options contracts are sensitive to fluctuations in the sale price of our ordinary shares  which are sensitive to various factors  including but not limited to i our financial performance  ii fluctuations in the overall us and foreign stock markets and economies  and iii expiration date of put option contracts 
in this regard  decreases in the sales price of our ordinary shares prior to the expiration of outstanding put option contracts may result in such contracts being exercise and us having to purchase our ordinary shares at unfavorable prices 
at december   there were  put option contracts outstanding with strike prices ranging from to and expiration dates between january and march if these outstanding put option contracts had been exercised as of december   we would have been required to pay approximately million to purchase  ordinary shares  representing our maximum exposure
